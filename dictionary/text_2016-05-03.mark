This delightful smaller sibling to the larger Chemex is perfect for the 1 cup at a time kind of person. With its deeper and more exaggerated cone shape, we find grinding finer than the larger Chemex works really well with this little brewer.
This is the classic wood collar design that is now part of the permanent collection at MoMA. It is also one of the most functional coffee brewers out there. The 6 Cup Size is really ideal for making 2 servings at a time. This is a classic for a reason!

At Coava Coffee Roasters, our philosophy is simple: we focus on quality, complexity, and balance in the cup. Our long term partnerships with amazing coffee producers combined with the diligent refinement of our craft has allowed our family to roast some of the highest scoring coffees in the world. We are honored to share them with you.

Oops! Something has gone wrong and the page you were looking for could not be found.
When Coava Coffee Roasters began packaging coffee by the kilogram in  our intention was twofold: First: Our roaster has been designed to operate most efficiently by the kilogram. By sticking to the metric system and maintaining strict roast cycles, we’ve been able to reduce our waste to less than one pound of coffee per week. This careful planning is another way we show respect for the work of the coffee producers we represent. Second: Roasting by the kilogram allows us to package our coffees in  gram increments. Known as the Coava , our retail bags promote freshness, dissuade waste, and divide evenly with most brew methods. It is the perfect quantity for the average coffee drinker.
To show respect for the full chain of quality coffee (sourcing, roasting, preparing) we do not offer any blends. Our coffees carry the names of the co-ops and individual farmers who harvest, process, and prepare them for us. We commit to show honor where honor is due.
We only partner with producers who are mindful of their people, their environment, and their crop. The farms we work with take great care of their coffee from seedling to harvest, through processing and storing, and finally in packaging. It is through these sustainable partnerships that we ensure the longevity of the coffee beans and the final quality in the cup.
We only work with the best importers and exporters. Their transparency, care for the farmers, and quality of transportation and storage of our coffees is absolutely essential. These partners are rarely heralded, but hold our industry together. Once the coffees arrive in Portland we move them directly into our green room. This temperature controlled room combines several proprietary practices and ensures that all of the work done before us is kept intact.
b: an occupation or trade requiring manual dexterity or artistic skill
Coava travels the world in pursuit of coffees with the highest quality, complexity, and balance. We take an exhaustive hands-on approach to coffee as an agricultural process. Dedicating ourselves to learning about soil conditions, sustainable farming practices, varietal mutations, and plant diseases are only a few of the areas of specialty that have helped us source outstanding coffees.
Each year, we spend months at origin courting the most conscientious coffee producers. We use our resources to build better processing facilities, introduce the best preservation practices, and spotlight individual farmers. We also collaborate with coffee mills to buy a farmer’s full harvest. This stands in opposition to the common practice of only purchasing parts of the harvest and leaving the farmer with the harder-to-sell remnants. Our rare approach ensures the purchase of an entire farm’s production at a higher price. We still get the top-tier separations, but we’ve also found a home for the rest of the coffees with the local coffee mill.
We make these efforts to establish mutually beneficial partnerships with the men and women producing the coffees we adore.
We are committed to the inherent qualities within each unroasted coffee. We strive to compose beautiful roast profiles that highlight the tremendous work that has been performed by the coffee producers each harvest. We never blend coffees and whenever possible we name them after the farmers who grow them. We are constantly tasting, documenting, and reevaluating our profiles to ensure that we enable individual coffees to shine.
After everything has been said and done Coava is rooted in preparing exceptional beverages. Our passion for balanced & sweet espresso, perfect milk drinks, and delicious brewed coffee brings our baristas together as craftsmen. We push for consistent excellence by refining our skills through palate calibration, systematic preparation, and self-critique. This dedication has earned our team many first place honors in the Barista Competitions.
a: given to general and cordial reception of guests
At Coava’s core is the desire to share the delicious coffees that we are excited about. We never dreamed that the pursuit of such a simple goal would surround us with all of the incredible people that make up the Coava family. From our shop’s dedicated regulars to coffee lovers around the globe, we enjoy coffee together. We’ve danced and celebrated, barbequed and tinkered, but also dug in deep and supported one another.
In similar fashion we would not be who we are without great partnerships. We problem solve harvest and processing issues alongside farmers. We help coffee shops all over the United States open, build up, and expand their businesses. We raise money and resources alongside non-profits to benefit our community. With these amazing partners Coava has been honored to grow, learn, and succeed.
b: northwest coffee roaster notoriously fueled by good folks and Led Zeppelin
Coava began in Matt Higgins’ garage in . The veteran barista and roaster bootstrapped the company by repairing motorcycles. His ambitions were to one day roast and prepare coffees that would be exciting for baristas and inviting to everyday drinkers. To do this, Matt knew that sourcing excellent "coava" would have to be the anchor of everything he did.
So he studied agriculture, farm practices, and sustainable business. He learned from everyone that he could and at the first chance he began traveling to the major coffee growing regions. He sought farmers whose careful work was producing quality crops with the type of complexity and balance that many single origin coffees didn't have at the time. His willingness to do what others would not eventually earned him a reputation among coffee producers as a respectful, diligent, and honest man. Those early years were adventurous and difficult, but laid the foundation for the many long-standing partnerships Coava has with farmers today.
With great coffees in hand, Coava began sharing them through a handful of Pacific Northwest coffeehouses. These early believers led the way for Coava to open our brew bar and roastery in southeast Portland in . We are indebted to and thankful for their support on this journey.
#coavainsight: The word Coava was introduced by William Biddulph to the western world in  in The Travels of a Certayne Englishmen in Africa, Asia, etc... Begunne in  and By Some of Them Finished-this Yeere .

On New Year’s Day we woke up at Ryan the roaster’s house. Some people were getting antsy to wade through the rain to a café or bar or something, but Ryan the roaster wasn’t having it. “It’s nice and warm here,” he said.“Let’s all just take our shirts off, and relax.”
That’s how we got the idea for this subscription. We want everyone to stay home, take their shirts off, and relax. We also ship to offices, where you can enjoy all the benefits of our subscription program except for the part about staying home, removing your shirt, and relaxing.
No matter where you are, the “single origin” subscription gets you a different coffee from a single origin (like a certain farm in Guatemala or co-op in Ethiopia) each delivery. If you are getting more than one bag, each coffee will be different. We choose; you enjoy. The “espresso” subscription gets you Friendo Blendo unless you get more than one bag, in which case we throw in a single origin espresso with each delivery. We roast; you relax.
Fellow club member, there's just one more step. Meet us over in the CART for the initiation ceremony.

Cupping notes : Deep Smokiness, Browned Butter, Caramel
Roast level : Dark
We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as baker’s chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.

Situated deep in the interior folds of the Southern Sierra Madre Mountains in Chiapas, Mexico is the coffee growing cooperative of Ramal Santa Cruz. Among this multitude of coffee farms lies the home of Augustin Sanchez Espinoza and his three brothers who all farm together on adjacent parcels of land. The farms of the Brothers Sanchez are at the upper reaches of viable coffee cultivation, starting at  meters and topping at just over  meters, the highest of all coffee grown in the cooperative. The family began planting coffee on the land in the early s. Many of the original plants are still producing. The majority of the coffee is Typica and Bourbon with a scattering of more recently planted Caturra.
The coffee from these four brothers and their farms make up our Mexico Fair Trade, Organic, Ramal Santa Cruz , Cuatro Hermanos.  This coffee greets you with a  red danjou pear citrus acidity followed with hints of raspberry honey and Meyer lemon.  We hope you will enjoy this extraordinarily smooth coffee from the Cuatro Hermanos.

The Tolima region, that is home to Maximino, is experiencing a transformation—from poverty and violence, due to the Colombian conflict, to a rebounding market for their high quality beans, offering a vehicle of change for its people.
In addition to producing fine coffee beans, Maximino is dedicated to nurturing his land and its wildlife. He not only grows sustenance crops such as maize and beans, he has also created a small nature reserve that provides a nesting site for the Colombian chachalaca.  This turkey-like, native bird is not endangered but has seen a continual declining population. It is Maximino’s commitment to give back to the land that has been so generous to him.
El Diviso is a complex coffee with cinnamon and milk chocolate aromas ,  mandarin and meyer lemon acidity and smooth cashew butter undertones.

To drink a cup of Ethiopia Nigusse Lemma is to connect with the origins of coffee.  Beans from Ethiopia’s Limu woreda (district) deliver unique flavors that can only be discovered in heirloom varietals.  Located in the southwestern part of country, Limu is not as well known as Yirgacheffe or Harrar, but deserves the attention that it is receiving.
Our Ethiopia Niguisse Lemma is sourced from the family farm of Lemma Edeto and is located in the highest elevations of the Limu region.  Shade from old growth trees, water from spring fed stream, and native varietal of coffee that flourish organically are in no better hands than the Edeto Family.  Lemma, with over  years in the coffee industry, has passed down the knowledge to his sons Nigusse and Haile, who operate the farm which their father recovered after it was confiscated by the Derg regime in the ’s.  The family’s commitment to quality includes a fully natural dry processing that insures no unripend cherries taint the taste of the finished product.  Fully control from farming to milling has resulted in award-winning coffee.  Nigusse and family were recently honored for the African Taste of the Harvest competition awarded by the African Fine Coffee Association.

This coffee comes to us from the farm of Welser Hernandez, just outside the town of Jacaltenango in the Huehuetenango Region of Guatemala. It’s here that Mr. Hernandez grows and processes his coffee—in the Sierra Madre Mountains that lie in the Western Highlands of the country. Though growing altitudes range from ,-, feet, the dry, hot winds from the Mexican plains fend off the threat of frost, naturally protecting the vegetation. After harvest, the beans—predominantly Bourbons and Caturra—are fully washed, then sundried, yielding the coffee bean that we call “Guatemala Mr. Hernandez”, in honor of his commitment to quality.

Three exceptional light roasted coffees from three different continents
A light roast, a medium roast, and a dark roasted blend
The most common source of fuel used to supply a coffee roaster with heat is gas. We are, however, the first and only roaster in the United States to roast coffee beans exclusively over a fire fueled by Oak Wood. The differences are not what one might initially expect. Unlike cooking with a wood oven or grill, where the smoke from the wood imparts a flavor to the final product, the main difference between wood and conventional roasting lies in the quality of the heat delivered to the beans. Heat derived from wood has higher moisture content and is better suited for slow roasting.
The more oil preserved within the bean, the more exquisite the final flavor will be. The natural humidity within the wood seems to envelop the beans during the roasting process, hence preserving more of the lipids within. Meanwhile, the slow roasting aspect ensures the coffee is lower in acidity and higher in body. The result is most apparent in our espresso, yielding more crema, fuller flavor, and a smoother finish. For drip coffee for which we actually wish to retain the acidity of the coffees, we subject the beans to a faster roasting time.
The unique advantages of wood roasting do not come without challenges, as the use of such an inconsistent fuel (i.e. wood) creates difficulties in maintaining consistency between roasts. A nightmare for an inexperienced operator, years of experience of roasting with wood are required to develop the intuition and instinct necessary to master the process. Luckily for us, with  years of wood roasting under our belt, we are able to claim this as an advantage; since through the unpredictable nature of roasting with wood, we are required to be attentive and obsessive with each and every roast: nothing can replace the skilled guidance of our experienced roasters. However, never the ones to be overconfident, we still go through extra steps to ensure consistency and quality.
We begin by selecting well seasoned wood from responsible suppliers. We then utilize thermocouple data collected at key locations on the roaster along with VFD motor control, which allows to make fan and drum speed adjustments during the roasting process. The wood smoke emissions are then abated by high powered afterburners which are in full compliance with local air quality standards. Combining these tools with our years of experience, we are able to maintain control of the roasting process with a very high level of consistency. As you can see, wood roasting is an artisan craft where human experience using old world methods, combined with the latest technological advances in roasting, delicately blend art and science. We hope you will enjoy a distinctive coffee experience which is impossible to duplicate.

Dry fragrance is marked by molasses sugars and malt grain, barley malt is what comes to mind in City roasts. Full City roasts see a slight uptick in fruited tones, but soft in comparison to the layers of sugar and cocoa. Adding hot water gives off a sense of bittersweetDutch cocoa powder in the steam, with balancing raw sugar smells. The cup is no far cry from what is sensed in the aroma: solid and straight-forward muscovado sugar sweetness, an undercurrent of powdered cocoa, and accents of malted barley grain. As the temperature cools down a bit, subtle fruit tones come into view, like dried cherry and golden raisin, coming through most in terms of acidity.

This process is known as E.A. Sugarcane. It starts by fermenting molasses to create ethanol and combining it with acetic acid–found in vinegar–to make ethyl acetate. This is added to water, and applied to the green coffee to dissolve the caffeine completely out of the beans. The caffeine is separated from the greens and is steamed and washed with more water.
This is truly an exceptional cup of coffee with flavors of citrus, caramel, and honey.

We’ve had the pleasure of working with the Desarrollo producer group in the town of Gigante, Colombia, for a number of years now, so we’re happy to announce the launch of Los Gigantes Decaf. 
In an effort to create a decaf that matches the caliber of our regular offerings, we pre-selected coffees with a bright and sweet profile before they are sent to be decaffeinated. At the Descafecol plant in Manizales, the caffeine is removed, as though by magic, using naturally occurring Ethyl Acetate derived from sugar cane. You'll find Ethyl Acetate in green coffee as well as various fruits, and it is the most common ester in wine.  
The resulting coffee is intensely sweet and fruited both in aroma and flavor, with notes of banana bread, preserved cherries, and chocolate pudding!
Need a quick and thoughtful gift for a host (or just want to treat yourself)? This sweet duo is just the thing:
•The Classic Ritual Mug or a Pillarbox Red Falcon Enamelware Mug  (let us know in the comments :)
•A  oz-bag of the coffee that our head roaster deems worthy of your generous heart!
Our newest coffee from Rwanda comes from the community of Kanyege, located in the southwestern mountains of the country, near Lake Kivu. Bourbon variety coffee cherries are grown on small, privately owned farms before being delivered to the Kanyege washing station. This coffee is an interesting mix of round, comforting flavors underlying a racy fruit acidity. Look for flavors of peach nectar and lemon brisk tea, sitting atop a warm background of hazelnuts and cocoa nibs.
Nyeri County, situated right between the slopes of Mount Kenya and the lush Aberdare National Park, is one of the world's most renowned coffee growing regions. With high altitude, rich volcanic soil, and ample access to fresh clean water, the terroir is perfect for growing great tasting coffees. As is typical in this region, this lot is the product of many small-holder farmers, who work collectively at the Kiamania factory. At the factory, the coffee is carefully fermented, washed and dried on raised beds, with special attention paid to sorting out the absolute best at every stage of the process. The result is a very floral cup of coffee, with clean flavors of raspberry, cherry and lime.
Nelson is an exceptional and unusual coffee producer for the El Cielito region. He’s a trained agronomist and botanist, and manages his expansive farm in a very professional manner, densely planting his Catuai variety trees in manicured rows to maximize production. While we typically associate big production yields with diminished quality, Nelson very carefully monitors his plants, driving up from the village daily in an old Dodge truck to insure they are all healthy and vigorous.
Nicknaming the farm “Chely”, after his mother, shows a softer side of Nelson that isn’t all business, and his sense of humor is as honed and effective as his growing practices. The fruits of all this labor are tremendously sweet, with a light nuanced acidity that has become a hallmark of great coffees from this region. Nelson has done much to challenge notions of traditional coffee cultivation, but it’s hard to disagree with his delicious results. 
In the Haight-Ashbury scene of the s, “side door” became a kind of stand-in term for the transgression of norms in a tumultuous period. It also signified a different way of looking at things, an alternative that, like many, would become suspiciously mainstream. It is in that revolutionary Aquarian spirit we offer you our Spring seasonal espresso blend, “Side Door.”
In the world of coffee, Brasil has always conjured up the image of ‘body.’ The coffees that hail from this country are heavy, sweet, and bring the creamy viscosity that are reminiscent of some of the best memories of espresso. The two Brasils featured in this blend are no different.
Located in the Cerrado growing region of the Brasilian state of Minas Gerais, the Recanto expresses the classic profile from this terroir: soft, sweet fruits layered on a bed of chocolate and nuts. Unlike much of the coffee of the Cerrado, the Recanto is tank fermented and washed, imparting a nicer acidity and providing greater nuance to the cup. Look for flavors of brown sugar, dried peach and roasted walnuts.
Brazil Fazenda Sertaozinho Yellow Bourbon Pulped Natural + GrainPro coffee is sourced from Fazenda Sertãozinho, an estate located in the municipality of Botelhos, within the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The estate has  hectares of protected forest with towering old growth trees called Jequitibá Rosa (Cariniana legalis), which are  meters tall and estimated to be more than , years old. ​
The other half of ‘Side Door’ is a duo of African coffees, representing the more experimental, bright side of the blend. The Rwandan Cotecaga is always a favorite around here with its foundation of the sweetness of graham cracker and higher notes of grilled watermelon and lime.
Our fourth component, Konyu heads into the mix. Konyu hails from Kenya, and provides a bright fruited melody to the ‘Door,’ with notes of peach, blood orange, and a silky body. 
This quartet of coffees comes together in the following manner: a fruit-flower accord of watermelon, lime and jasmine on top; a rich and smooth texture like ganache in the middle; and an overwhelmingly cookie-like sweetness. That is to say, it’s balanced in a way that some other blends can only hope to be. It can be sweet, easygoing, and traditional; yet forward-looking, experimental and far-out - all while staying quintessentially “Ritual.”

The Souza family has long been part of what we do here at Ritual. For years João Souza, affectionately called Ziñho amongst his friends and family, had been doing things a bit differently in Brasil. After the devastating 'Black' frost of  and the subsequent skyrocketing of coffee prices all over Brasil, farmers started turning their focus to producing coffee for volume. Ever a man of tradition, Ziñho kept producing coffee the way his father taught him, and in turn, passed on his talent and wisdom to his children and grandchildren. Today, his son Bruno works the land in the same way as his father, picking coffee only when at its peak, processing cherries carefully in small batches, and ultimately striving for the best coffee he can produce - not just the most coffee he can produce. This Sweet Tooth offering is a blend of Rubi and Catuaí cherries dried carefully over - days in the natural method and then milled directly on the farm. The care in producing this spectacular offering comes through with amazing clean and complex flavors - look for notes of ripe peach and apricot brightened with a light orange acidity over a backdrop of syrupy sweet milk chocolate.
As a roaster that is committed to promoting our producers and bringing them out of anonymity, single origin espresso has always been important to us. The best shots of espresso we've ever had have been single origin--dynamic, sweet, and complex. They are balanced, and good in milk to boot.
Throughout the year we will be showcasing eight to twelve single producers in homage to our original Sweet Tooth blend. An anti-blend that explicitly showcased the producers whose coffees comprised it. Sweet Tooth will be a rotating single origin on which we've put our stamp of approval as a great shot of espresso.

We’ve had the pleasure of working with the Desarrollo producer group in the town of Gigante, Colombia, for a number of years now, so we’re happy to announce the launch of Los Gigantes Decaf. 
In an effort to create a decaf that matches the caliber of our regular offerings, we pre-selected coffees with a bright and sweet profile before they are sent to be decaffeinated. At the Descafecol plant in Manizales, the caffeine is removed, as though by magic, using naturally occurring Ethyl Acetate derived from sugar cane. You'll find Ethyl Acetate in green coffee as well as various fruits, and it is the most common ester in wine.  
The resulting coffee is intensely sweet and fruited both in aroma and flavor, with notes of banana bread, preserved cherries, and chocolate pudding!

Our newest coffee from Rwanda comes from the community of Kanyege, located in the southwestern mountains of the country, near Lake Kivu. Bourbon variety coffee cherries are grown on small, privately owned farms before being delivered to the Kanyege washing station. This coffee is an interesting mix of round, comforting flavors underlying a racy fruit acidity. Look for flavors of peach nectar and lemon brisk tea, sitting atop a warm background of hazelnuts and cocoa nibs.
Nyeri County, situated right between the slopes of Mount Kenya and the lush Aberdare National Park, is one of the world's most renowned coffee growing regions. With high altitude, rich volcanic soil, and ample access to fresh clean water, the terroir is perfect for growing great tasting coffees. As is typical in this region, this lot is the product of many small-holder farmers, who work collectively at the Kiamania factory. At the factory, the coffee is carefully fermented, washed and dried on raised beds, with special attention paid to sorting out the absolute best at every stage of the process. The result is a very floral cup of coffee, with clean flavors of raspberry, cherry and lime.
Nelson is an exceptional and unusual coffee producer for the El Cielito region. He’s a trained agronomist and botanist, and manages his expansive farm in a very professional manner, densely planting his Catuai variety trees in manicured rows to maximize production. While we typically associate big production yields with diminished quality, Nelson very carefully monitors his plants, driving up from the village daily in an old Dodge truck to insure they are all healthy and vigorous.
Nicknaming the farm “Chely”, after his mother, shows a softer side of Nelson that isn’t all business, and his sense of humor is as honed and effective as his growing practices. The fruits of all this labor are tremendously sweet, with a light nuanced acidity that has become a hallmark of great coffees from this region. Nelson has done much to challenge notions of traditional coffee cultivation, but it’s hard to disagree with his delicious results. 
In the Haight-Ashbury scene of the s, “side door” became a kind of stand-in term for the transgression of norms in a tumultuous period. It also signified a different way of looking at things, an alternative that, like many, would become suspiciously mainstream. It is in that revolutionary Aquarian spirit we offer you our Spring seasonal espresso blend, “Side Door.”
In the world of coffee, Brasil has always conjured up the image of ‘body.’ The coffees that hail from this country are heavy, sweet, and bring the creamy viscosity that are reminiscent of some of the best memories of espresso. The two Brasils featured in this blend are no different.
Located in the Cerrado growing region of the Brasilian state of Minas Gerais, the Recanto expresses the classic profile from this terroir: soft, sweet fruits layered on a bed of chocolate and nuts. Unlike much of the coffee of the Cerrado, the Recanto is tank fermented and washed, imparting a nicer acidity and providing greater nuance to the cup. Look for flavors of brown sugar, dried peach and roasted walnuts.
Brazil Fazenda Sertaozinho Yellow Bourbon Pulped Natural + GrainPro coffee is sourced from Fazenda Sertãozinho, an estate located in the municipality of Botelhos, within the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The estate has  hectares of protected forest with towering old growth trees called Jequitibá Rosa (Cariniana legalis), which are  meters tall and estimated to be more than , years old. ​
The other half of ‘Side Door’ is a duo of African coffees, representing the more experimental, bright side of the blend. The Rwandan Cotecaga is always a favorite around here with its foundation of the sweetness of graham cracker and higher notes of grilled watermelon and lime.
Our fourth component, Konyu heads into the mix. Konyu hails from Kenya, and provides a bright fruited melody to the ‘Door,’ with notes of peach, blood orange, and a silky body. 
This quartet of coffees comes together in the following manner: a fruit-flower accord of watermelon, lime and jasmine on top; a rich and smooth texture like ganache in the middle; and an overwhelmingly cookie-like sweetness. That is to say, it’s balanced in a way that some other blends can only hope to be. It can be sweet, easygoing, and traditional; yet forward-looking, experimental and far-out - all while staying quintessentially “Ritual.”

The Souza family has long been part of what we do here at Ritual. For years João Souza, affectionately called Ziñho amongst his friends and family, had been doing things a bit differently in Brasil. After the devastating 'Black' frost of  and the subsequent skyrocketing of coffee prices all over Brasil, farmers started turning their focus to producing coffee for volume. Ever a man of tradition, Ziñho kept producing coffee the way his father taught him, and in turn, passed on his talent and wisdom to his children and grandchildren. Today, his son Bruno works the land in the same way as his father, picking coffee only when at its peak, processing cherries carefully in small batches, and ultimately striving for the best coffee he can produce - not just the most coffee he can produce. This Sweet Tooth offering is a blend of Rubi and Catuaí cherries dried carefully over - days in the natural method and then milled directly on the farm. The care in producing this spectacular offering comes through with amazing clean and complex flavors - look for notes of ripe peach and apricot brightened with a light orange acidity over a backdrop of syrupy sweet milk chocolate.
As a roaster that is committed to promoting our producers and bringing them out of anonymity, single origin espresso has always been important to us. The best shots of espresso we've ever had have been single origin--dynamic, sweet, and complex. They are balanced, and good in milk to boot.
Throughout the year we will be showcasing eight to twelve single producers in homage to our original Sweet Tooth blend. An anti-blend that explicitly showcased the producers whose coffees comprised it. Sweet Tooth will be a rotating single origin on which we've put our stamp of approval as a great shot of espresso.

We always look forward to the arrival of these coffees, which often happens right around our holiday season. Sulawesi is the only Indonesian coffee we bring in because the processing there more closely resembles that of Central America (as opposed to the earthy notes present in many Sumatran coffees). 
Our Minanga Villages micro lot comes from Toraja Utara and is decadently sweet. Full-bodied coffee with notes of vanilla, nutmeg, dark chocolate, with a lightly crisp citrus acidity. S variety grown at - meters, fully washed.

Our green buying team constructed this regional lot while cupping dozens of freshly harvested coffees in Antigua at Bella Vista Mill in January. In our search, small producer lots from Chimaltenango stood out as the most fruited, vibrant and sweet coffees available. To present the best possible offering, we decided upon constructing this blend from our three top-scoring lots. Chimaltenango is a central region in Guatemala and possesses many of the ideal characteristics to produce exceptional coffees:  to  meters of altitude paired with a vast majority of Caturra and Bourbon varieties make for a solid foundation of quality. This cup leads with aromatics and flavors of toffee and nougat and continues to become more vibrant as it cools with a dynamic display of flavors ranging from black cherry to milk chocolate to cashew butter.
Fresh coffee is roasted on Sundays and Wednesdays and shipped the following day. Please place your order by : PM Eastern Time the evening before the respective roast day to ensure that it is included.

Kiumu landed stateside early this year thanks in part to the collaboration with our export partners in Kenya. Kiumu represents the next chapter in our mission to develop a quality-founded relationship coffee with a single estate producer in the region. Last year, this budding exploration brought us to Muranga County. During our travels we were fortunate to meet John Njoroge, who owns and personally manages Kiumu, a parcel of a  acre estate which he shares with his brothers. Parlor is in the nascent stage of an exclusive relationship with John: we purchased every one of John’s Kiumu lots this year because we believe in the potential of this coffee. John Njoroge’s Kiumu is ripe with flavors coveted in the finest Kenyan coffees: juicy stone fruits meld with citrus notes and make way for a remarkable flavor of fresh blackberry. We are excited for the evolution of this relationship coffee throughout this season and for seasons to come.

In the small colony of Collasuyo in Caranavi region Nicolas Calque and his wife Maruja are doing a careful job at their process station. They have a farm called “ La Florida”  in Collasuyo of  hectares where they produce and process their coffee. Nicolas started in coffee industry  years ago. His neighbors recognize him as a coffee lover and at the age of  Nicolas went to live with grandmother  as his family were having economical problems. He started working as coffee picker, whilst his grandmother provided food and shelter. In  Nicolas invested all his savings and bought a farm in the colony of Collasuyo where he dedicated his entire farm to produce coffee, but the prices they were receiving for their product were too low to cover the family costs. In  Nicolas and his wife sold their farm and moved to Brazil to improve their quality of life. However, they soon changed their mind, ”It was not what I expected, I worked over  hour in a sewing plant, we lived with  families locked in a room in poor conditions.”  says Nicolas. Six months later Nicolas returned home to Collasuyo with his family and bought back the coffee farm in the farm from his savings. This has motivated Nicolas to produce more and tastier coffee. He’s a part of the program that Daniela and Pedro has, called Sol de Manana. Pedro and Daniela are exporting the coffee and finding a good market for it, they are also training the farmers to work for a higher quality with less leaf rust. This year Nicolas has planted two more hectares of coffee.

Caranavi, located   kilometres north of La Paz city, it has been noted as the centre of Bolivian coffee production. With the super rich soil combined with high altitudes, it has become the epicentre for coffee production in  Bolivia. 
Given the regions potential to produce unique exotic flavours it really is a hotbed for amazing coffee. Despite it’ s international recognition, Caranavi has neglected its coffee production. A mixture of ageing coffee plantations, reducing yields and leaf rust, combined with a high pressure towards coca cultivation has meant the coffee has been in decline. With coca being  times more profitable and with less growing issues, it has meant many producers have abandoned coffee production in favour of this lucrative crop.  
To try to save specialty coffee in Caranavi, our exporters Daniela and Pedro Roudriguez have started the project Sol de Manana. They have been sourcing coffee from small coffee producers in the region for three decades. However this steady decline of coffee production has not only put at risk the sustainability of there export business, but the future of coffee production in Bolivia is at risk of disappearing forever.  
They assumed the challenge of boosting the production and support the Bolivian coffee growing by the planting of new coffee plantations under a sustainable model based in three pillars.

Besides Caturra and Typica,  they are here growing new exotic varieties to plant in its farms and implement new processes post-harvest.

Pedro and Daniela are exporting the coffee and finding a good market for it, they are also training the farmers to work for a higher quality with less leaf rust. This year Nicolas has planted two more hectares of coffee.
Producer: Nicolas ColqueLocation: Collasuyo, Caranavi, Bolivia Varietal: Caturra, Catuaí and Typica Harvest: May to September , peaking in June and JulyProcess Date: th July Elevation:  - maslProcessing: Full-washed and dried on chemical beds for - days. Our current espresso recipe: g /  sec /  g (a TDS about .% which gives an extraction around %).  Flavour description: A very mature and sweet cup with a big body. Notes of red grape, rasin and dried fruit.  
Elda is a young women who together with her husband Felix Choquehuanca source beautiful cherries from the colony of Taypiplaya. During the day they both tend the land, pruning, clearing and picking the cherries.  
At the end of the day both Elda and Felix hand sort the cherries for unripes and defects, knowing this will help them be selected as a micro lot. Then by Taxi they deliver their cherries to the Buena Vista mill Every night from  pm to  am where the coffee is processed.  If selected as a micro lot it is separated and then cupped at the mill to access its quality. Being selected means a higher price for the cherry, and can then go on to be a lot like this one.
They are now a part of the program that Daniela and Pedro has, called Sol de Manana. Pedro and Daniela are exporting the coffee and finding a good market for it, they are also training the farmers to work for a higher quality with less leaf-rust.

Caranavi, located   kilometres north of La Paz city, it has been noted as the centre of Bolivian coffee production. With the super rich soil combined with high altitudes, it has become the epicentre for coffee production in  Bolivia. 
Given the regions potential to produce unique exotic flavours it really is a hotbed for amazing coffee. Despite it’ s international recognition, Caranavi has neglected its coffee production. A mixture of ageing coffee plantations, reducing yields and leaf rust, combined with a high pressure towards coca cultivation has meant the coffee has been in decline. With coca being  times more profitable and with less growing issues, it has meant many producers have abandoned coffee production in favour of this lucrative crop.  
To try to save specialty coffee in Caranavi, our exporters Daniela and Pedro Roudriguez have started the project Sol de Manana. They have been sourcing coffee from small coffee producers in the region for three decades. However this steady decline of coffee production has not only put at risk the sustainability of there export business, but the future of coffee production in Bolivia is at risk of disappearing forever.  
They assumed the challenge of boosting the production and support the Bolivian coffee growing by the planting of new coffee plantations under a sustainable model based in three pillars.
Economical, Social and Environmental; Sol de Manana. In this project La Linda was the very first and perhaps most important farm. Besides Caturra and Typica,  they are here growing new exotic varieties to plant in its farms and implement new processes post-harvest. This one is a very unique example of them being the Longberry varietal. This one amazed us with a white sugary like sweetness, elegance and floral notes. This coffee is one of the four coffees we’re buying from Daniella and Pedro this year. This being the smaller lot we only have  kilo’s, a true nano lot.

Nariño is located in the far south-west of Colombia bordering Ecuador, and is in general one of the most challenging, but also most interesting places to work. There is extremely high elevation, coffee up to  meters, very steep hillsides, and mainly super tiny producers in remote areas.
General production in Colombia is based on smallholders related to a cooperative or association. Nordic Approach is working with the Growers Association Cafe Occidente, who are currently attracting a lot of great farmers as they have established a cupping lab, and through buyers like us pay the premium back to the growers.

The area of Tarqui in the region of Huila is relatively unexplored for specialty coffee. Nordic Approach sourced this coffee and are predicting that we will find a lot of tasty coffee from this region in the future. This coffee from farmer Jaime Alzate placed third in the Nordic Approach quality competition that was held in December . One of the things that makes this coffee interesting is the fact that the parchment gets delivered in small quantities to the processing station almost every day, resulting in complete traceability and thus, better quality control.

Put your aeropress and cup on a scale. Bring filtered water to a boil. Thoroughly rinse paper filter to get rid of paper flavor.
Weigh out  grams of whole bean coffee. Grind the coffee a bit finer than filter drip (or use a grind that suits best for flavor and extraction).
Pull water off of the boil, and wait  seconds to a minute, or until the water is - degrees Fahrenheit. Start your timer, and quickly pour the water into the aeropress until it reaches  grams of water (near the top). Stir coffee.
Place plunger in just enough to seal the top, and keep coffee from dripping through.
 At  seconds, remove the plunger, and stir for five seconds. Place the plunger back on the aeropress to keep coffee from dripping through.
At  minute  seconds, remove plunger and stir for  seconds. Place the plunger and slowly push down for  seconds, until you hear a hissing sound. There should be moderate resistance. If it's very difficult to push down, your grind is too fine, if it's very easy, your grind is too coarse.
Make sure your coffee maker is clean and free of residue build up. Weigh out your coffee. A good ratio to start would be  grams (. ounces) of coffee to  liter (. ounces) of water.

Have you ever wanted to take part in a coffee cupping/tasting? Cupping coffee is a practice that is vital to our company when making decisions with coffee purchasing. Because our company is quality focused, it’s  something that we do every single day (with all of the coffee we roast). Cupping coffee (if practiced the right way) can tell us a lot about the quality of the green coffee & the roast. We will guide you through the steps in the way we, at heart coffee roasters, cup our coffees. You will learn techniques with how to properly cup, as well as learn about the coffees you are tasting & observing. At the end of the class, you will leave with a oz bag of beans that has been carefully selected for you! The cupping is  hour in length & will be located at our roasting facility. The facility is not open to the public, but is open to those who are participating in our classes offered. Otherwise, the space is open by appointment only. You will receive an email with directions to the cupping.
All sales for cupping class are final, no refunds.

How do I pick a coffee? Baffled about which coffee to pick? Take our Coffee Quiz! Or feel free to give us a call or email us (--- or help@lacolombe.net. Our Coffee Crew would love to help you find a coffee that suits your taste buds.  What are cupping notes? Does this mean your coffee is flavored? Our coffees do not contain added flavors. However, each of our single-origin coffees and blends has its own unique flavor. Those flavors and aromas come naturally from the coffee bean and can be affected by factors like country of origin, altitude, growing practices, processing techniques, and roasting styles. Coffees roasted more lightly have more of the characteristics unique to eachorigin, while those roasted on a darker level have more of the classic chocolatey and smoky tones found in our Classic and Reserve Blends.  The tasting notes that you’ll find on your bag of La Colombe coffee are what we taste when we brew and drink the coffee. By creating a simile between what we’re tasting in the coffee and familiar flavors we’ve had before (chocolate, apple pie, toasted marshmallow, etc.), it’s easier to communicate the often complex tastes that coffee can take on.  What grind should I choose? The choice of grind will depend on how you brew your coffee. Usually, we recommend ordering your coffee whole bean and grinding it fresh before you brew. But if you don’t have a good-quality grinder, let us pre-grind it for you! We recommend the following grinds for specific brewing methods: Drip for regular automatic drip coffee machines Melitta/Chemex for pourovers Turkish a fine grind for Turkish coffee French Press a semi-coarse grind for immersion methods Home Espresso a fine grind for home espresso machines Commercial Espresso an even finer finer for commercial espresso machines Percolator a grind only to be used for a percolator coffee maker  Why does grind size matter? Read more here. What are your café location and hours? Our national locations and hours can be found at our Cafés page here at this link.
What is the best way to store coffee? The best way to store coffee in an airtight container in a dark cupboard. There’s no need to freeze! Just keep your beans away from sunlight, air, and humidity.  How long is the shelf life? We recommend drinking your bagged coffee within  weeks of the roasting date. The coffee will not spoil after this date, but it will lose the amazing aromas and flavors we strive for in roasting.  Our cans of coffee remain fresh for about a year.  Our Pure Black cold-pressed bottled coffee has a shelf life of - weeks.  How do I brew coffee? There are infinite ways to brew coffee, and all coffee folks have their own strong opinions as to what makes the best cup. For our recommendations, check out our brewing tips video or our blog.  What is the difference between classics, reserves and single origins? What are seasonal single origins blends? At La Colombe, we have three different coffee lines. Classic Blends are our cornerstone blends that have been here since the very beginning. These are the coffees we drink on a daily basis, and if you’re new to La Colombe, we recommend checking them out! Reserve Blends are modern and refined specialty blends take you on a journey of different flavors, all while remaining within the traditional coffee wheelhouse. Workshop Coffees are roasted in small batches and come from a single origin, usually a single farm or specific region of a country. Our seasonal Workshop blends are comprised of multiple unique, single-origin coffees.  How do I return a product I did not like? If you don’t like a coffee we’ve sent you, no worries at all. From the day you receive your coffee at home, you have  weeks to let us know if you liked it or not. If you didn’t enjoy it, we’ll email you a return label and have you send back the undesired product. Then we’ll ship you another coffee of your choice! To return a coffee or another product, reach out to us at help@lacolombe.net.

Todd Carmichael and JP Iberti founded La Colombe on a simple but profound premise: America Deserves Better Coffee. By sourcing and roasting with care, and borrowing on ancient and modern coffee traditions from around the world, the two have built a successful company and an elevated coffee experience for Americans. Through  years of hard work and innovation, the two have made sure that experience is shared in cafes and homes across the country.
Todd Carmichael has lived and breathed coffee for over three decades. By pressing the limits of taste, service, and most notably, coffee sourcing – visiting the world’s developing countries to responsibly gather the planet’s best coffee – Todd has converted the nation’s culinary elite into La Colombe drinkers. Along the way, he has made his company the country’s leading coffee roaster while managing it philanthropically.
JP Iberti is the craftsman behind the company's urban-industrial café spaces, and artisan breads and pastries. Trained in a classical Italian café setting and transplanted into Seattle’s emergent s coffee scene, JP became entranced with the craft of roasting coffees beautifully. He abandoned an early career as a pilot to pursue the other machine that fascinated him—the coffee roaster. To this day, JP says that roasting coffee requires many of the same skills—attention, care, finesse—required to properly operate an aircraft.

Here at La Colombe, we are keenly aware of where our coffee comes from, how it was grown, and, most importantly, the needs of the people involved in the coffee’s journey from seed to cup. We care deeply about the wellbeing of coffee-growing communities, and we strive to implement the best business practices to increase that wellbeing.
As one of the early pioneers of direct trade, we pride ourselves on proactive, longterm relationships with small-holder farms and socially responsible coffee-growing associations. For us, the quality of our coffee starts with the quality of these relationships. By working directly with farmers to create mutually beneficial partnerships, we can increase transparency in the supply chain, guide farming practices to yield better and better beans, and support the livelihoods of coffee-producing communities.
Founded in  by La Colombe and the Clinton Foundation, the Haiti Coffee Academy supports coffee farmers in the southeast region of Haiti through education, training, materials, and market access.
Haiti is a place that is close to our hearts, and a place where coffee production has suffered in recent decades. We are committed to supporting the Haitian coffee industry by buying a significant amount of Haitian coffee each year and bringing their beautiful beans to the U.S. craft coffee market. Learn more about the Haiti Coffee Academy here.
Around the world, millions of people and thousands of communities lack access to clean drinking water. We believe that access to water is an inherent human right, and we partner with organizations who share this philosophy. By providing free drinking water in our cafes, we seek to raise awareness about water initiatives in the hopes that one day, everyone will have equal access to this life-giving resource.
Fairness – All trading partners are to be treated fairly. No strike price is ever to be below that established by the Fair Trade Organization. Additionally, farm workers' wages must be verifiable fair, working conditions must be humane and basic health must be made available.
Longevity – Long-term commitments are to be established with all coffee sources, thereby providing a more certain future for our trading partners.
Opportunity – Priority is given to nations, regions and farmers with the greatest need and where our purchases can make the greatest impact.
Water – Access to clean drinking water must be provided by the farmer to the families associated with our supplier farms.
Strictly Earth Conscious – Earth Conscious coffees are coffees grown on farms that hold at least two earth friendly certifications.
In addition to supporting our coffee-producing communities, we seek to support, nurture, and enhance the local neighborhoods that are home to our cafes. From providing free coffee to a nearby homeless shelter to helping with the community garden across the street, we work hard to engage with our environment and create meaningful connections with our neighbors.

﻿One last coffee from the Huila region before we say goodbye to Colombia for the season. This regional Timana blend is a perfect summation of what we love from this region of production. The Timana is incredibly clean, with lots of sugar and toffee up front, which is balanced by a gentle and refreshing grape and stone fruit acidity.

We're always anxiously awaiting the first fresh crop arrivals from Ethiopia each season, and this year, that coffee is the Shoye. From the Sidamo region of Ethiopia, the Shoye shines with floral green tea character, balanced with bright limeade and sugary peach. While the Shoye is only the first hint of things to come for the season, it should not be missed.

Occasional bits of deliciousness from your friends at Blue Bottle.
You can stick with the basics and get a lot of mileage out of your AeroPress, but you can also experiment with tools and techniques for countless variations on your morning cup. Here are three ideas.
Did we ever think we would set up shop in the desert for some 200,000 guests? No, not even close.
Many shots were pulled, pitchers steamed, and miles traveled by our intrepid Blue Bottle baristas on their journey to the U.S. Coffee Championships.
Hedy Macferran, Director of Culinary at Blue Bottle Coffee, shares her travel philosophy, the food she loves, and why she thinks everyone should take time to travel alone.
A day ends at the stroke of midnight, but for many of us who labor over creative pursuits, it’s hard to say exactly when a project is finished.
Proust, Trident gum, and finding solace in a “dumb” phone
Sometimes, we need to go down roads no one else will. And if you can do it with an iced coffee in hand, even better. 
Mornings are tough. There are no two ways about it. 
​Our newest cafe lives (somewhat improbably) at the crossroads of LA’s nostalgic automotive history and the contemporary LA metro. But, as Joan Didion said: “You have to pick the places you don’t walk away from.”
To a boy hungry for the future, that car was everything—mystery, complexity, elegance, rarity, and urbanity. The car, even in pictures, reeked of promise for the coming years. 
It all started with sweet Ivy, James’s pup and the very first #dogofbluebottle.
We’re proud of our current offerings of small bites and easygoing breakfasts. Yet, we haven’t offered a seasonal menu that gives guests a complete culinary experience. Until now.

Stout and creamy with carmalized flavors of chicory root

Two hundred years before we started selling our coffee in San Francisco, the French brought coffee
infused with stout, carmalized flavors of chicory root to the shores of New Orleans. Blended with
creamy whole milk and organic cane sugar, our ready-to-drink, cold-brewed version pays homage
to that tradition in a sweet, nostalgic carton.

Our road trip-ready iced coffee is made of three simple ingredients: coffee, water, and time

Designed to inspire adventure and movement, our portable cans promise days on the trail, at
the beach, and camping with friends-in one adorable and sustainable package. The taste is luminous
yet dense, bright yet chocolatey, small yet powerful.

In the late 1600s, the Turkish army swept across much of Eastern and Central Europe, arriving at Vienna in 1683. Besieged and desperate, the Viennese needed an emissary who could pass through Turkish lines to get a message to the nearby Polish troops. Franz George Kolshitsky, who spoke Turkish and Arabic, took on the assignment disguised in a Turkish uniform. After many perilous close calls, Kolshitsky completed his valiant deed, returning to give the Viennese the news of the Poles’ imminent rescue of their city. On September 13, the Turks were repelled from Vienna, leaving everything they brought: camels, tents, honey, and strange bags of beans, which were thought to be camel feed. Kolshitsky, having lived in the Arab world for several years, knew these were bags of coffee. Using the money bestowed on him by the mayor of Vienna for his heroic deed, Kolshitsky bought the Turks’ coffee, opened Central Europe’s first coffee house (The Blue Bottle), and brought coffee to a grateful Vienna.

319 years later, in Oakland, Calif., a slightly disaffected freelance musician and coffee lunatic, weary of the grande eggnog latte and the double skim pumpkin-pie macchiato, decided to open a roaster for people who were clamoring for the actual taste of freshly roasted coffee. Using a miniscule six-pound batch roaster, he made a historic vow: “I will only sell coffee less than 48 hours out of the roaster to my customers, so they may enjoy coffee at its peak of flavor. I will only use the finest, most delicious and responsibly sourced beans.” In honor of Kolshitsky’s heroics, he named his business Blue Bottle Coffee, and began another chapter in the history of superlative coffee.

Now, more than 10 years later and thanks to the enthusiastic support of many loyal customers, Blue Bottle Coffee has grown to a small network of cafes, an espresso cart, and some vintage German coffee roasters. We are still united by the simple purpose of getting great coffee to everyone who asks for it. Improbably and delightfully, there are hundreds of us now. We roast coffee on vintage gear, put it in compostable bags, and still get it to our customers within 48 hours. We roast great coffee in four cities, make great drinks, clean up after ourselves, bake cookies, type up invoices, get change at the bank, and say please and thank you. We offer the elderly and pregnant our seats on the bus and brush and floss daily. We look forward to seeing you soon.

We met Moisés Herrera and Marysabel Caballero—the couple that runs Finca El Puente—in . Since then, they have become like family and inspire us every year. From experimental coffee varieties and growing techniques to unique ways of processing, they push the boundaries of quality. This mostly Catuai-variety lot is lush with notes of Concord grape accented by a brown-sugar sweetness that finishes with a crisp, toasted nut character.
Recognizing Uganda’s incredible potential for quality, we worked with our partners at the Chema washing station to create some unique coffees. This lot was specially selected from the highest farms in the region and processed using underwater fermentation—in place of their usual dry-fermentation method—to create a momentous coffee with bright notes of black cherry and cola with a creamy body.
This coffee comes from the area of Calvas in southern Ecuador near the Peruvian border. Fifteen growers cultivated Typica and Caturra varieties on very-small organic farms to produce this single-community lot. Look for simple and sweet notes of chocolate and almond balanced by a creamy body.
In the western district of Nyamasheke, Rwanda—only a few kilometers from the beautiful Lake Kivu—Jarama is an exciting new farm. Planted in  and , this -hectare farm, and the organization that manage it, are already receiving awards for their quality. Look for notes of raisin, brown sugar, and clementine.
Uganda is not a country well known for specialty coffee. Farmers in the lush volcanic hills of Mount Elgon grow excellent SL- and SL- varieties at some of Africa's highest elevations, but, for years, poor processing has held them back. The Chema washing station is pioneering processing improvements at every step to bring us a refined coffee with savory notes of stone fruit and cocoa.
This coffee is the result of the hard work of about two dozen small- and medium-sized family farms growing mainly Bourbon- and Typica-variety coffee in the small village of Bonta at approximately , meters. Small lots from these farms are processed and kept separate for us by the Colbran family—our long time partners in Papua New Guinea—to create a coffee that is savory, softly citric, and delicately tea-like.
The Orgánica cooperative in the region of Cauca, Colombia, has been creating coffee for our La Golondrina offering since . Over the years, they have shown they are one of the strongest organizations we work with—and it's no wonder they have one of the best organic coffees in the country. Look for layered flavors of milk chocolate, cherry, and nut.

	One day we realized that our coffee bags were more fashionable than us. To fix this, we partnered with Grand Rapids based designers Seth Herman and NoPattern to create apparel that even non-coffee-drinkers will love. Check back often for fresh seasonal designs.

	Each and every one of our coffees has a unique personality and special story. We love them all equally but for very different reasons, with each of them becoming like part of the Madcap family. We encourage you to check out each coffee&#

	Located in the Nariño Department in southwest Colombia, Galeras is culled from micro-producers outside of the capitol, Pasto. All the farmers who contribute to Galeras grow coffee surrounding the active Volcan de Galeras, where it gleans its name. The climate here is dry and we believe that dryness, in combination with super-high elevations, accounts for the creation of some of the most complex coffees in Colombia.

	 is our first year working with this handful of producers in Nariño who own, on average, less than  hectare of coffee — an extremely small amount. To build this offering we partnered with a cooperative to help us separate great tasting lots and to build this blend. Our hope is to develop this relationship and grow our Galeras offering year after year. The quality is stunning, yet the potential for improvements is even higher.

	Over the last decades, quality coffee production in Rwanda has advanced substantially. Since being decimated by civil war and strife, coffee has become a major export in Rwanda, where more than three-quarters of its citizens subsist through agriculture. Investment in infrastructure to process coffee and close work with growers has increased production of specialty coffee, work aided by non-profit and government funded programs, some of which was advised by professionals in specialty coffee. Kanzu the Cooperative  has had the support of Technoserve, an organization that was also involved in Mutovu and Yukro. It certainly helps that Rwanda’s terrain is very mountainous, with the high elevations, healthy ecosystems and nutrient rich soil beneficial to quality production.

	The Kanzu name refers both to the cooperative and the washing station. Kanzu rests in a valley betwixt mountain peaks near the shores of Lake Kivu. Founded in  with the aid of Technoserve, Kanzu brings together the coffee from hundreds of farmers who harvest fruit from trees cultivated on the mountains above and deliver ripe cherry for processing. Old-growth bourbon trees and terroir of the Nyamasheke region provide the backbone for this coffee with powerful character and acidity, while a  hour fermentation process adds complexity. After harvest and drying in March-July, this coffee then faces an epically long journey from land-locked Rwanda here to the USA.

	Lush, deeply fruited, and juicy, Kanzu is vivid, clear and clean. This marks our third consecutive season purchasing coffee from the Nyamasheke region. This dynamic coffee represents the potential for high-quality in Rwanda, and elsewhere in Africa where excellent terroir can be at odds with challenges in infrastructure and government which make uncovering coffees like Kanzu difficult. We’re very excited to offer this coffee for Winter and Spring.

	The Las Serranias is decaffeinated using the Natural Ethyl Acetate Method at the Descafecol plant in Manizales. Ethyl acetate is used as an extractor of the caffeine component of the coffee. Generally, this decaffeination process is performed using added chemicals. The ethyl acetate used in the Las Serranias, however, is obtained using fermented sugar cane (which naturally contains ethyl acetate), complementing the sweetness of the coffee. Rarely will one ever find a decaf coffee as sweet, complex, and enjoyable as the Las Serranias. Las Serranias is the exclusive decaf that is offered at Madcap as we are yet to find an option that comes close to comparing.

	Lucas Melo’s farm, El Cairo, is situated high above the town of El Tambo in the Nariño region of southwest Colombia, nearly flush with the equator. This location, warm breezes from the Pacific, soils rich in organic matter, and deep canyons where collected heat rises at night, make coffee production possible at very high altitudes, which is helpful in developing sweetness and acidity in the cup. Additionally, very consistent sun and rainfall ensure a steady growing environment.

	This terroir provides the habitat for a producer like Lucas Melo to nurture this stunning Caturra and Castillo coffee. To ensure a high-quality and tasty cup, he begins with diligent, selective picking followed by a detailed washing process that includes a -hour soak, followed by drying on plastic tarps outside his home. The resulting coffee sings with bright, clear fruit notes.

	As a multiple Cup of Excellence winning producer, Lucas’ coffee is highly sought after. We are very fortunate to be one of his few regular buyers since our purchase of his nd Place CoE lot in .

	Since , Luis Reinoso’s coffee has been a star in our lineup. That year we began to purchase coffee from Luis and his brother Didier. Luis’ Colombian farm, Finca Vista Hermosa, or, “farm with a beautiful view”, rests at roughly  meters above sea level, looking out on a mix of cultivated coffee and natural forest.

	This high elevation provides the coffee trees with cool temperatures and a lower oxygen environment associated to coffees with fine, bright acidity. Indeed, we find lush fruit flavors of plums, cherries and citrus defining Luis’ coffee as a filter or espresso brew. In cultivation are Caturra and Bourbon varieties, at a roughly - ratio, both of which are associated with lower-yield but high-quality cup characteristics. Having only two varieties is a risky choice &#

	Pepe and his son, also Pepe (who also has a son, you guessed it, named Pepe) got into coffee farming to give back to the earth what the earth had so kindly given to them. Pepe Mayor had the opportunity to see many parts of the world as he served as an ambassador of Ecuador in various countries over the years. Similarly, Pepe Menor traveled many parts of the world as a professional climber for a number of years, and he became the first Latin American to climb all the highest peaks in all  continents. After many years of traveling and spending time in nature, the father-son duo decided to start a coffee farm, rooted in the belief that their style of sustainable farming is one of the best ways to strengthen the ecosystem in their region.

	This special selection from the farm is made up of % Typica Mejorada, a Typica-like variety common in the area. The process of production is traditional, yet incredibly particular and detailed. Only “sangre de toro” (dark red) cherries are picked and pulped before receiving natural-air fermentation and thorough washing and slow drying on raised beds in the mountains. The process is kept simple, yet regularly tested, refined, and explored to make sure only the cleanest and tastiest results are coming out of each lot.

	The family-owned operation started farming coffee under the name Cafe Instinto (coffee instinct) due to their core values, which are “passion and instinct.” They strive to work in harmony with the land as much as possible and to test out many farming techniques to minimize their footprint on the land. The farm pays their workers some of the highest wages we’ve seen and also offers competitive salaries and benefits to their full-time employees.

	With all of the diligence and care that goes into the process, the cost of production is quite high, but so is the quality of life and work environment on the farm. While the process places a heavy emphasis on quality, the real secret in producing such vibrant and unique coffee, according to Pepe Menor, is that the coffee is alive. The coffee experiences the passion of the family as every single seed is individually touched at at least one stage in the process. Each night the coffee listens to classic rock on vinyl (particularly Jimi Hendrix) as it is blasted from the system of their bamboo home located in the center of farm.

	The San Sebastian is a coffee showcasing the work of small shareholders in the municipality of La Plata in Huila. The coffee is produced by the Asociacion de Productores de Cafe de Alta Calidad del Occidente del Huila (OCCICAFE).  The profile found in this coffee is the result of piecing together around  exceptional lots to create a clean and sweet cup.  Nearly one thousand lots are cupped to build a lot of this size and quality. The growers involved in OCCICAFE all work side by side with quality analysis and are responsible for the harvesting, milling and drying of their coffee. La Plata is a small town of about , residents which was initially named San Sebastian de La Plata by early settlers. While La Plata has historically been known for silver, today’s economy is mostly agriculture. This season will mark the th harvest we have purchased from San Sebastian!

	In honor of our hometown area code here in Grand Rapids, we dubbed this blend Six One Six. Six One Six is enjoyable, trustworthy, and balanced: designed to be a delicious coffee that everyone can savor and trust everyday, much like the city itself. Embracing our commitment to seasonal changes in coffee harvests, the coffees in Six One Six change throughout the year, lending subtle flavor differences that keep this blend interesting. 

	The Spring Fling is a lively Madcap blend to celebrate the spring season. It’s full of life and new beginnings with sweet, delicate, and floral flavor.  This is another seasonal blend that carries our intention of stepping outside of the box to create an exotic experience made up of a couple of our finest fresh crop offerings.  It’s the perfect beverage to enjoy while flowers blossom and the birds start chirping.

	Embracing our dedication to excellent coffees, the Third Coast Espresso blend uses several of our best coffees in the course of the year to produce a luscious espresso: sweet, flavorful, and complex in its pure form, yet robust enough to support milk drinks. Careful observation throughout the year will yield the joy of tasting subtle, seasonal flavor changes. The Third Coast Espresso produces a rich texture, mixed berries, vibrant acidity and a balanced creamy body.

We believe so strongly in the power of super-fresh coffee that we only deliver to you weekly what you will drink in  to  days. If we sent you enough coffee for two weeks--or even worse an entire month--it would begin to lose it's vibrancy before you could finish half of it.
          Think of it like this: You'd never buy a month's worth of farmstand veggies at a single time. Likewise, we can't let you drink stale coffee. You can easily change the amount we deliver weekly from your dashboard.

Bright flavors of ripe red apple and guava precede a caramel body and elegant agua de panela sweetness in the finish.
La Gaitana is a micro blend of coffees from various producers near small towns such as Timana, Palestina and Pitalito in South Huila.

Remarkable cup clarity, a crisp acidity, and a candy-like sweetness. Soft floral aromatics introduce flavors of lemon zest and fresh berries.
A first-time offering for Sightglass, this coffee comes to us from the village of Wanja Qarsa in the Gera District of Jimma. This region is known for nutrient-rich soil and wild, heirloom varieties. Processing practices and equipment quality at cooperatives within this village have improved immensely over the past few years, and as a result, yield amazing coffees such as this one.

We start with the highest quality coffee, cold brew it without heat for over  hours, then use a double filtration process to procure the end result: a complex, smooth and full-bodied brew with low-acid and a chocolate finish. Feelings of invincibility and euphoria are likely to follow.
You don't do dairy. Say no more. We've mixed our life-affirming Cold Brew with the finest coconut cream from Sumatra, Indonesia for a dairy-free, vegan game changer. Coconut Cold Brew is made with three natural ingredients so separation is bound to happen. For a good time, shake it like you mean it.
Our cascading and creamy Nitro Cold Brew is now available in a pop top. Pour it like you mean it into a glass or drink it straight from the source.
We bottled up our Original Cold Brew so it’s ready to go wherever you are. Enjoy straight out of the bottle or pour over ice. Cheers!

      “Every Stumptown employee is a steward of that single coffee cherry, from the time it gets picked until the time it ends up in your cup. Stumptown is an energy and a vibe and a culture, but it all ultimately revolves around amazing, incredible coffee.”

      
        —Skip Colombo, Partnerships & Sales
      

We work hard. We make lots of jokes. We cheers beers, ride bikes together, go to shows and trade dogsitting favors. We have tremendous amounts of respect for each other and for what we do. Stumptown is a family on an elemental level. Many of us are artists, musicians, creative types, and passionate types. It helps our coffee taste better and it makes our work lives richer.
And we drink the best office coffee on the planet.  
Some of us came because we were regulars. The baristas knew our drinks and were having a whole helluva lot more fun than the jobs we had. Some came because of the coffee. Some of us were home roasters, or worked for other coffee companies across the country. Came for a chance to work with the best green coffee in the world.
Some came because our best friends worked here. Most became best friends with our coworkers, because they also happened to be some of the best, most interesting people around.
We all came because we wanted to be here. A grip of us have been here for over a decade. We’ve outgrown our first employee holiday dinners, squeezed in the backroom of a cozy Italian family restaurant in Southeast Portland. We’ve leapt across the country. Went Dutch for a summer. But our holiday parties still rage.
We are passionate group of folks, some might even say obsessive. No matter which team we’re on, we’re sourcing, roasting, tasting, testing, practicing and pushing ourselves to do it better.

          We know we are the last link of a long chain, stretching across the earth, made up of hundreds of people and years of toil, soil and sweat to get this coffee into our hands. We take that responsibility very seriously. And we also have a lot of fun.
        

Our cafes are our living rooms, where we strive to let our coffee shine to its full potential. Our baristas spend months learning how to pull the most pristine shot of Hair Bender espresso, and even longer taming the steam wand to master the art of pouring a perfect latte. We undergo continuous education and attend regular tastings, understanding the full spectrum of our coffee menu so we can help you pick out a coffee you’re going to love.

        Coffee is about pleasure. It’s that moment when your hand is warmed by the mug, you bring it up to your nose, inhale deeply and then take a sip.
      

        That sip is the culmination of years of work, three-thousand mile journeys, and passion. Here is how we make that sip perfect.
      

        While you are holding that cup of coffee, close your eyes. Open your mouth slightly. Breathe in deeply through your nose.
      

        You are smelling the most complex thing humans consume. When people talk about the flavors of coffee — notes of orange, or hints of clove — it’s because those organic molecules are contained in the coffee bean. If a coffee reminds you of apple pie, it's because coffee shares some of the same components as food, like lactic and malic acid.
      

        Inside that small bean are the same natural components that make flowers smell so lovely, the same ethers that let you know when a piece of fruit is ripe. Coffee has twice as much going on, molecularly speaking, as red wine.
      

        When tasting coffee, try waiting for it to cool down a little — you’ll be able to taste (and smell) the most when it’s the same temperature as your body.
      

        Flavor only matters in the context of you. What do you like? What does this scent remind you of? Are you looking for a full-bodied cowboy co
        ffee, or a delicate, tea-like finish? Chocolate aromas, or hints of jasmine?

        Don’t worry if you can’t describe it precisely, or have a different perception than someone else. Even when you can’t put it into words, you’ll know what you like.
      

        You experience the full flavors of the coffee bean if and only if nothing has gone wrong during…
      

        Someone stands by that roaster, all day, a person who knows exactly how to bring the best out of every bean — that ideal ratio of sweetness to acidity, that balance — because he or she has been doing this for years.
      

        Again and again, they repeat the same motion: pull a tiny sample of the beans. Stare at them, looking for the tiny signs of perfection. Smell them deeply. Put them back. Pull out some more beans. Stare. Smell. Five seconds later, repeat the process in a meditation that last hours. Do that hundreds of times a day. Do that every day for years.
      

        Know every bean on a personal level. Adjust times and temperatures throughout the day, knowing that  seconds could make the difference between letting this bean shine and overwhelming it. Know that in the morning, the roaster is cold. Know that in the evening it’s hot, and you should probably shave  seconds off that roast.
      

        Roast just enough to bring out the best and full potential of what’s inherent in each particular coffee already. Roast to draw out things like acidity, floral notes, chocolate, molasses, and earth. All of the coffee’s flavor potentials are presented at the first crack – an audible signal that happens at a particular point when roasting coffee. After that, roast just enough to add the right amount of body and sweetness, without degradation.
      

        Roasting different coffees as though they’re the same? Not going to work. Roasting for color, not taste? Never this.
      

        Please don’t burn those beans. They’ve been through so much. They’ve come all the way across the world.
      

        The best coffee grows in the most remote places. There is a thin band that goes around the world near the equator. Within that band, you need mountains, thick old-growth forest and just the right microclimate. Set aside up to four days to get there.
      

        On your way there, you’ll pass through Houston’s H.W. Bush Intercontinental Airport, or you’ll stand in the endless security line at New York’s JFK en route to distant parts of Ethiopia, Colombia, Indonesia and  other countries around the world.
      

        You’ll also experience  vaccines (the malaria pills—which can cause hallucinations and nightmares—are the worst), a passport that fills up with handwritten visas, bumpy eight-hour van rides, granola bars and in at least one case, eating the heart of a bull that has been slaughtered in your honor.
      

        The Green Team members, named for the color of coffee beans before they are roasted, don’t do it the easy way, which would be buying bulk, mid-quality beans at a trading floor in a capital city. Instead, they go right to the source of the best coffee — that farm or washing station high atop a distant Ethiopian hill. It ends when they arrive at that distant farm, washing station, factory or mill. They sit down in a home or around a campfire to talk about this year’s crop with a producer they have met many times. They get to work.
      

          In Colombia, if you go to four farms you will get four bowls of sancocho, which is this soup with chicken, yucca, plantains, potatoes, corn, avocado. Basically, it’s as many calories as you can cram in a bowl.”
        

        The Green Team visits every producer as often as possible, sometimes up to three times per year. They constantly roast and taste the coffee, and they form long-term, lasting partnerships with the producers. They’ll help them implement a new farming technique that could lead to even better coffee. Or they’ll teach a seminar on a new way to process coffee cherry, which is the fruit of the coffee tree surrounding the seed or bean.
      

        They routinely pay producers up to four times what they could get for their crop on the commodity market, but in return, they ask for a lot more work—hand picking each cherry at ideal ripeness, or implementing a new piece of equipment.
      

        The Green Team also identifies potential future producers—maybe this side of the mountain has just the right climate, but the quality level isn’t there yet. Stumptown will invest in that farm, or mill, or factory if that producer is willing put forth effort to get the beans to the level the Green Team looks for. It’s a partnership, and there is prestige and pride involved. For a producer, selling to Stumptown means something.
      

        Above all, they want to help farms become sustainable and to set up strong businesses that build up their communities and produce the highest-quality coffee possible year after year.
      

          Our partners are much more than farmers, they are coffee production experts, constantly innovating practices in planting, harvesting and processing the best coffees around.”
        

        We don’t buy in bulk on a trading floor. We buy directly from the people who are making the coffee. It’s not a transaction; it’s a partnership. If someone is growing the quality of coffee we’re interested in, then we will help them in any way we can. That means regular visits (even though that trip can take up to four days), implementing new techniques and equipment, and forming long-term partnerships.
      

        We shoot for sustainability, and not just in the environmental sense. A sustainable coffee producer is someone who is paid fairly for their incredible work and who can in turn encourage others to follow in their footsteps. A sustainable producer innovates, develops and improves cultivation and in turn can fetch even higher prices from Stumptown. The more each side of the partnership puts in, the better the coffee gets.
      

        We don’t call them farmers, we call them producers, which gives credit to the fact that they are production experts. They are the ones who make this coffee great. They are the ones who are like-minded, who will go the extra mile for quality, whatever that means.

          Producers are the heart of what makes great coffee.
        

          Their skills, expertise and craftsmanship is the difference between mediocre coffee and coffee that is like nothing you’ve ever tasted before. The coffee will never get any better in quality once it lands in our hands, after all. We rely on the producers for that pristine bean. A good roaster works tirelessly to preserve that coffee’s inherent greatness.
        

          The producers grow the coffee trees. They pick the cherry when it is perfectly ripe. They remove the outer fruit, leaving just the bean covered in a thin parchment. They rest the beans, let the beans develop into their full selves.
        

          Everyone on this page does something slightly different — he may tend a small patch of coffee trees on the farm he inherited from his grandmother; she may oversee the cherry soaking in a big tank of water, fermenting at just the right rate.
        

          They live on four continents. They speak at least  different languages. Some use traditional methods that are centuries old; some have taken out four-year loans to get that new top-of-the-line piece of equipment that will lead to a greater, cleaner cup.
        

          It’s not the easy way. It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way, and it creates the best coffee possible.
        

        Coffee is a tree, and you probably prefer one branch to another, even if you don't know it yet.
      

        There isn’t one kind of coffee, there’s a coffee family tree.   For hundreds of years, humans have been cultivating, hybridizing and perfecting it, and today there are hundreds of types, or varieties.
      

        The variety of coffee tree matters—or at least, it usually does. Just as different types of grapes yield different wines, the variety of th
        e bean can have a profound impact on the finished cup. &#
