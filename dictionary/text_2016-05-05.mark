The coffees we end up bringing to Vancouver are the result of determination and passion from the farmers and all parties along the supply chain working to preserve that initial hard work.
The people we work with are up at the crack of dawn, tirelessly working towards a plentiful and sweet harvest. They are vibrant members of their communities. We love working with them.
We visit each of our producer partners as often as we can (annually is the norm for us), and communicate throughout the year.
We collaborate too. Financing Martir’s dryer is one example. When they grow, we grow with them. If you want to know the nitty gritty, check out our Transparency Update.
These coffees are the result of nearly thousands of samples cupped, and many miles logged. It's the result of multi year commitments by producers to grow, pick, and process exciting coffees. Enjoy!
This delightful smaller sibling to the larger Chemex is perfect for the  cup at a time kind of person. With its deeper and more exaggerated cone shape, we find grinding finer than the larger Chemex works really well with this little brewer.
This is the classic wood collar design that is now part of the permanent collection at MoMA. It is also one of the most functional coffee brewers out there. The  Cup Size is really ideal for making  servings at a time. This is a classic for a reason!
This is the size and style of Chemex we use in-store at Bar Nine. The glass handle makes swirling the liquid after the brew a breeze and additionally allows you to prepare  full servings, ideal for the multi-person house-hold or the business looking to get a little more bang for their buck.
Available for Pick Up Only for our retail customers.

This Decaf is from Kenya. The Swiss Water Process uses only pure "flavor charged water" and a charcoal filtering system to remove caffeine from green coffee beans. The beans are first soaked in very hot water and caffeine is leached out of the beans' cellular material. The solution is then passed through a carbon filter with a porosity specifically sized to capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through. The Swiss Water Process is certified organic and % chemical free. In addition, they are also certified Kosher by the Kosher Overseers Association.

Robinson Figueroa is a stand out among his coffee producing peers.  As a rd generation producer, he focuses on quality production over quantity.  When visiting last, we were excited to see Robinson planting a part of his farm with geisha & bourbon varieties.  With plans in place to build his own wet mill, we expect great things from Robinson in future years.

It's difficult to source high scoring coffee out of Brasil which is why we are proud to offer this coffee from Jose Oliveria.  It's our first year bringing this coffee in but we are confident that it's the beginning of a long term relationship.  The Cerrado Minerio Region is one of few producing high scoring lots and is the only area in Brasil with a "Protected Geographical Indication".

The Capucas Community has fought hard for their reputation of quality. Located near the Mayan ruins, on the western side of Honduras, the land was originally used for growing tobacco. It was repurposed for coffee until the ’s. Since that time they have led the way in modernization for the sake of consistency.

Kilenso Mokonissa is one of the smallest villages in the Borena Hagermariam District of Sidama. In the past the coffees coming from Kilenso would have been blended into larger lots and sold under the area’s catch all name “Ardi.” The farmers there use organic practices (though they are too poor to pay for the certification) so as to not waste anything they produce.

To honor our long standing relationship with the Kochere Cooperative we are highlighting a dozen of their top scoring producers. These stalwarts have proven themselves through consistently delivering only the ripest of cherries. After processing and a period of rest we have the green coffee sorted for defects an additional two times longer than other lots coming out of Kochere. This Coava exclusive is named for the beautiful “blossoms” found on coffee trees before harvest.
Black tea, honey comb, and sweet rose blossom mark the Meaza among the most delicious Ethiopian coffees we have ever tasted.

When Coava Coffee Roasters began packaging coffee by the kilogram in  our intention was twofold: First: Our roaster has been designed to operate most efficiently by the kilogram. By sticking to the metric system and maintaining strict roast cycles, we’ve been able to reduce our waste to less than one pound of coffee per week. This careful planning is another way we show respect for the work of the coffee producers we represent. Second: Roasting by the kilogram allows us to package our coffees in  gram increments. Known as the Coava , our retail bags promote freshness, dissuade waste, and divide evenly with most brew methods. It is the perfect quantity for the average coffee drinker.
To show respect for the full chain of quality coffee (sourcing, roasting, preparing) we do not offer any blends. Our coffees carry the names of the co-ops and individual farmers who harvest, process, and prepare them for us. We commit to show honor where honor is due.
We only partner with producers who are mindful of their people, their environment, and their crop. The farms we work with take great care of their coffee from seedling to harvest, through processing and storing, and finally in packaging. It is through these sustainable partnerships that we ensure the longevity of the coffee beans and the final quality in the cup.
We only work with the best importers and exporters. Their transparency, care for the farmers, and quality of transportation and storage of our coffees is absolutely essential. These partners are rarely heralded, but hold our industry together. Once the coffees arrive in Portland we move them directly into our green room. This temperature controlled room combines several proprietary practices and ensures that all of the work done before us is kept intact.

b: an occupation or trade requiring manual dexterity or artistic skill
Coava travels the world in pursuit of coffees with the highest quality, complexity, and balance. We take an exhaustive hands-on approach to coffee as an agricultural process. Dedicating ourselves to learning about soil conditions, sustainable farming practices, varietal mutations, and plant diseases are only a few of the areas of specialty that have helped us source outstanding coffees.
Each year, we spend months at origin courting the most conscientious coffee producers. We use our resources to build better processing facilities, introduce the best preservation practices, and spotlight individual farmers. We also collaborate with coffee mills to buy a farmer’s full harvest. This stands in opposition to the common practice of only purchasing parts of the harvest and leaving the farmer with the harder-to-sell remnants. Our rare approach ensures the purchase of an entire farm’s production at a higher price. We still get the top-tier separations, but we’ve also found a home for the rest of the coffees with the local coffee mill.
We make these efforts to establish mutually beneficial partnerships with the men and women producing the coffees we adore.
We are committed to the inherent qualities within each unroasted coffee. We strive to compose beautiful roast profiles that highlight the tremendous work that has been performed by the coffee producers each harvest. We never blend coffees and whenever possible we name them after the farmers who grow them. We are constantly tasting, documenting, and reevaluating our profiles to ensure that we enable individual coffees to shine.
After everything has been said and done Coava is rooted in preparing exceptional beverages. Our passion for balanced & sweet espresso, perfect milk drinks, and delicious brewed coffee brings our baristas together as craftsmen. We push for consistent excellence by refining our skills through palate calibration, systematic preparation, and self-critique. This dedication has earned our team many first place honors in the Barista Competitions.
a: given to general and cordial reception of guests
At Coava’s core is the desire to share the delicious coffees that we are excited about. We never dreamed that the pursuit of such a simple goal would surround us with all of the incredible people that make up the Coava family. From our shop’s dedicated regulars to coffee lovers around the globe, we enjoy coffee together. We’ve danced and celebrated, barbequed and tinkered, but also dug in deep and supported one another.
In similar fashion we would not be who we are without great partnerships. We problem solve harvest and processing issues alongside farmers. We help coffee shops all over the United States open, build up, and expand their businesses. We raise money and resources alongside non-profits to benefit our community. With these amazing partners Coava has been honored to grow, learn, and succeed.

b: northwest coffee roaster notoriously fueled by good folks and Led Zeppelin
Coava began in Matt Higgins’ garage in . The veteran barista and roaster bootstrapped the company by repairing motorcycles. His ambitions were to one day roast and prepare coffees that would be exciting for baristas and inviting to everyday drinkers. To do this, Matt knew that sourcing excellent "coava" would have to be the anchor of everything he did.
So he studied agriculture, farm practices, and sustainable business. He learned from everyone that he could and at the first chance he began traveling to the major coffee growing regions. He sought farmers whose careful work was producing quality crops with the type of complexity and balance that many single origin coffees didn't have at the time. His willingness to do what others would not eventually earned him a reputation among coffee producers as a respectful, diligent, and honest man. Those early years were adventurous and difficult, but laid the foundation for the many long-standing partnerships Coava has with farmers today.
With great coffees in hand, Coava began sharing them through a handful of Pacific Northwest coffeehouses. These early believers led the way for Coava to open our brew bar and roastery in southeast Portland in . We are indebted to and thankful for their support on this journey.

On New Year’s Day we woke up at Ryan the roaster’s house. Some people were getting antsy to wade through the rain to a café or bar or something, but Ryan the roaster wasn’t having it. “It’s nice and warm here,” he said.“Let’s all just take our shirts off, and relax.”
That’s how we got the idea for this subscription. We want everyone to stay home, take their shirts off, and relax. We also ship to offices, where you can enjoy all the benefits of our subscription program except for the part about staying home, removing your shirt, and relaxing.
No matter where you are, the “single origin” subscription gets you a different coffee from a single origin (like a certain farm in Guatemala or co-op in Ethiopia) each delivery. If you are getting more than one bag, each coffee will be different. We choose; you enjoy. The “espresso” subscription gets you Friendo Blendo unless you get more than one bag, in which case we throw in a single origin espresso with each delivery. We roast; you relax.
Fellow club member, there's just one more step. Meet us over in the CART for the initiation ceremony.

The components of this rich blend are selected for their ability to stand up to a deeper roast profile. With a more developed roast we are able to pull out deep notes of dark chocolate, molasses and toasted nuts. We created Benchmark to satisfy those customers looking for a rich, smooth, balanced and robust coffee.

Banco Michacha is a new cooperative located in southern Ethiopia in the Kercha District of the Guji Zone.  Its  members are smallholder farmers meaning that their farms are very modest and typically operated by the members of the family with no outside hired help.
At the end of each day's harvest, the farmers bring their perfectly ripe coffee cherries to the receiving station of the Banco Michicha wet mill.  Their delivery is weighed and they are paid cash for the day’s pick.  Since it is a farmer-owned cooperative under the Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union, the prices and policies are set by farmers.
The coffee cherries are depulped using a disk depulping machine.  The outer fruit is discarded and composted.  The mucilage-covered seeds are then deposited in a tile-lined tank and fermented for - hours underwater.  Finally the seeds are washed in tile-lined canals before heading to their last  hour soak in clean water.  
 As a whole, Ethiopia has excellent conditions for drying coffee.  This coffee was dried out in the open air using raised beds for approximately  days.  These beds provide excellent airflow for even drying at the perfect rate.  The result is a vibrant coffee that roasts evenly and holds on to its quality for a much longer time than coffees from other growing regions.  
The member farms of Banco Michicha sit between  and  meters above sea level and grow Ethiopian heirloom varieties.
All orders are roasted on Monday and Thursday and are shipped on the same day. Note that if you order Two-Day Shipping after am on any given day, your order will be processed *the following roast day*. We do this to ensure your coffee arrives to you as fresh as possible!

Gakundu is a wet mill or “factory” located in Embu County on the eastern slopes of Mt. Kenya. Gakundu was established in  and together with  other co ee factories Kamviu, Gichugu and Gakui, it forms the Gakundu Farmers Coopertive Society. While this mill gathers  active members, the whole society has over  farmers registered. The mill is run by a factory manager but all activities are supervised by committee members. Gakundu, on average produces , kilos of green co ee annually consisting of cultivars SL and SL. The majority of the co ee processed through Gakundu comes from smallholder farmers who deliver ripe co ee cherries to the mill to be processed. The cherries are oated in water to sort for quality. Afterwards, the fruit is stripped mechanically before the seeds are fermented for  hours in open air. Next, the seeds are then moved to a tank with fresh water fro another  hours before being washed through canals to remove the remaining mucilage. Finally, the co ee is dried on raised beds in the sun. During the hottest parts of the day and coldest parts of the night, the co ee is covered in order to prevent extremes in drying conditions, promoting even drying.

The Baroida Estate is owned and operated by the Colbran family. They have been growing coffee in the eastern highlands of Papua New Guinea since the mid ’s. Historically, they’ve presented their coffee to exporters to be blended and sold as generic lots from their region. However in , they exported their own coffee for the first time as an estate selection. It turned out to be one of the cleanest, most vibrant coffees to come out of Papua New Guinea. Since that first export, year after year they have implemented quality controls that have raised the bar even higher for the region’s coffee quality. in addition to growing, milling, and exporting coffee from their estate, they also buy coffees from small farmers in surrounding areas, process the cherries and sell them on their behalf. 
Baroida sits at - meters above sea level. The coffee is comprised of Typica, Bourbon, Arusha, and Mundo Novo. After ripe cherries are picked, they are depulped using disk depulpers, dry-fermented for  hours, and dried on tarps. If the weather won’t permit tarp drying, mechanical dryers are used.

St. Louis based Kaldi’s Coffee Roasting Co. is excited to announce the opening of four new stores in . These will be the seventh and eighth stores in the St. Louis area and the second and third stores in Atlanta, Georgia for the company. 
The first St. Louis location to open will be at the Gerhart building, located in the Gerhart Lofts at the corner of Laclede and Vandeventer, next to St. Louis University and the Cortex district. The second will be at the Mid Campus Center (MCC) building, located at  Children’s Place, which is currently under construction on Washington University’s Medical School campus.
The Gerhart building is located blocks from Kaldi’s Coffee’s Roastery, and will join the burgeoning neighborhood in St. Louis. “With IKEA going in, and SLU right across the street, we saw the potential for this location. When Capstone Development approached us about opening a cafe, we couldn’t have been more pleased,” says Kaldi’s owner Tricia Zimmer-Ferguson. The cafe is part of a larger rehabilitation of the building, with other retail on the first floor and lofts on the second. The building itself dates to  and is on the National Register of Historic Places. “Expect to see some classic architecture and details mixed in with some new modern touches” adds Zimmer-Ferguson.
“We’ve been looking to add a new location in St. Louis for the past couple years and these two are perfect fits” continues Zimmer-Ferguson. “Our relationship with Washington University just keeps getting stronger, and the new MCC building is going to be a beautiful addition to their campus. We’re excited to build out our location within the larger construction of the building, so we can form our ideal cafe from the ground up.” The Kaldi's Coffee at the MCC is in partnership with Bon Appetit Management Company.
Kaldi’s Coffee is working with Space Architects on the Gerhart cafe and Christner on the MCC cafe.
The two new locations in Atlanta, Ga., will join Kaldi’s first Atlanta store at Emory University’s Dobbs University Center. Bon Appetit Management Company and Emory University invited Kaldi’s to open a store there last summer. Building on that success, Kaldi’s will open a full-service cafe at the Depot, a historic train station located at One Eagle Row, in the heart of Emory’s campus, and a coffee bar at the Emory University School of Medicine.
The Depot was built as the train station for Emory University in , but service there stopped in . Subsequent iterations of the building were an art gallery, a credit union, and a restaurant. “We’re excited to expand our presence at Emory University,” says Kaldi’s owner Tyler Zimmer. “We’ve been developing a different menu for this location too, since we have a full kitchen to work in.”  Kaldi’s is working with Square Feet Studio on the Depot cafe. The Emory University School of Medicine location will consist of coffee service, house-made bakery, and some grab & go items.
Caitlin, one of our customer service reps, Brandon, from our Kirkwood cafe, and Bud, one of our roasters, were in Las Capucas, Honduras last week. Here are some stories and pictures from their trip.
We visited Beneficio Santa Rosa de Copan on our way to Las Capucas. Their facility was beautiful and they had a great cupping lab. We took a tour of the dry mill - they poke every bag for QC as they stack them in amazing pyramids in the warehouse. The really large white bags are micro lots that are separated. They are sorting by density and again by color - using electronic sorting (infared camera picks out the ones that aren't the right color). 
We cupped the top  finalists for the cupping competition. There were lots of great coffees throughout the trip so it's no surprise that the top ten scored well (+). We then went to the zipline! This course consisted of  ziplines that took us from a farm to the Las Capucas wet mill - what a great view from above! Brandon was the most courageous - great aerial videos and photos are thanks to him Bud and I were holding on too tight - no free hands for photography! 
Brandon and I started the morning at the farm of Bernard Ornilla. His entrepreneurial spirit has resulted in many projects to better the community and continually improve quality. Bernard is always moving forward and his farm, Finca de Origenes Planon, is no exception. Located at almost  meters in the Celaque mountains, this farm spreads down the mountainside and makes for a beautiful landscape. Finca de Origenes Planon, meaning "origins", the farm is compiled of many different varietals from many different origins across the globe. We saw red catuai, yellow catuai, and red bourbon among other varieties. Because the farm is organic, many other plants grow among the coffee trees including lemons, limes, avocados, bananas, and plantains. 
The festivities began later that day with Te Van a Conocer Compa. There was great music, local vendors, wonderful dances and delicious street food. They announced the winners of the competition and we got to meet the farmers who's coffee we will be featuring at Kaldi's. The winner of the competition had visited Atlanta a few years ago. He was beside himself when we shared with him that we were going to feature his coffee in our cafe in Atlanta. What a great connection! We hope to continue to grow our relationship with the producers of Las Capucas in the future.
A lot of us at Kaldi’s are big big soccer fans. We’ve played growing up, we’ve played in college, our kids play, and we even had a go at an indoor league (check out that picture!). But this may be our proudest soccer moment yet. Starting this year, Kaldi’s is a proud sponsor of the Saint Louis Football Club and St. Louis Scott Gallagher.
“We followed the club pretty close last year, so when the opportunity arose to be a part of this team, we jumped at the opportunity.” says Kaldi’s co-owner Tyler Zimmer. “Their proud connection to St. Louis and all the work they do with the city and with their youth programs only made us more excited to lend our support.”
We can’t wait to follow the team in the USL this year, and look forward to the years to come.
Wednesday was a travel day for our group. After spending the first  days in Pyin Oo Lwin, it was time to head to the highlands of Shan state. Myanmar has many different microclimates and the weather changed quite a bit on our drive. It is still  months until raining season begins and much of the drive was very brown. It will look very differently in May. It took us  hours to make the trip including a few stops to see some amazing heritage sites and pagodas.
Ywangan is home to many smallholders in the area. In , there was a new emphasis brought to the area to try to increase quality and in return, a better price for their coffee. Traditionally, much of the coffee in the area was either consumed domestically or in China, neither bringing very high prices. Coffee has been grown in this area since , after it was introduced by English Missionaries. There are dozens of small villages in the area and the Myanmar Coffee Association has begun to work with about  of them, representing over  smallholder farmers. Traditionally, the coffee is washed as each village has their own pulper. Winrock and USAID have helped set up a small cupping lab in Ywangan complete with a sample roaster and dehuller, where we will cup  different lots from different villages. Winrock also has a full time Q grader here training locals on technical and cupping skills. The goal is build a sustainable model locally.
We visited with Myanmar Coffee Association Vice Chairman, U Win Aung Kyaw at a local storage building where coffee is often stored before heading to the Mandalay Coffee Group to be dry hulled. The vice chairman was very grateful for the visit and is very encouraged by the improved quality they are seeing. They have doubled the prices that the local farmers are be paid to incentivize quality. He said they need to continue education and training but they are seeing an impact. Other small growers in the area are noticing the difference and want to be more involved with the association and Winrock. One of the bigger changes has been implementing some new ideas on the processing side. They have been doing some natural process coffees and the results seem encouraging.
After meeting with U Win Aung Kyaw, we met with Su Su Aung and many other smallholders, all women. She has been very active as a leader in the area since - when she began acting as a broker for the region and encouraging trade between the producers and China. Su Su Aung had a very impressive milling operation and some of the cleanest looking natural coffees you will see in any coffee producing countries. She has had training from Mario Fernadez and Marcelo Pereira, who is a Winrock employee and coffee veteran after stints in Costa Rica, Brazil, and Ethiopia. She is a role model for all the women producers in the region. Her production of naturals is small this year, , pounds, but she hopes for more next year.
Thursday we will begin to cup many coffees from the area and visit many local villages to see some production. More to come…  #followthegoat

It is our second day here in Pyin Oo Lin and we start out the day by heading to the Mandalay Coffee Group’s office and cupping lab. We checked out their mill and the systems they have in place. This is the nd year that the mill is in operation and it is as nice as any in the world. All the coffee here is wet processed and fermented  hours in concrete tanks. The coffee is then moved to the concrete patios where the coffee is turned and raked until it is dry. It is then moved to their storage facility where the coffee rests until the parchment is ready to be removed at the dry mill. They are still finishing their dry mill on property so their coffee is milled at a nearby facility.
After the more in-depth tour of the mill we have  rounds of tables to cup. There are  coffees from the Pyin Oo Lwin region that we are evaluating. For perspective, last there were very few coffees scored over  points in the entire country. In this morning’s cupping I scored  of the  over  points with the lowest score being  and the highest score . This is a dramatic improvement in quality from last year and this is still a very small sample size. Most of the top coffees last year came from the Ywangan area in Southern Shan state which we will see tomorrow and Thursday.
After cupping we visited two more estates beginning with the Lone Star Estate. The ways that some of the farms get their names is quite funny. In this instance the owner had a friend from Texas and next thing you know you get Lone Star Estate! This was another relatively large farm of about  acres,  of which is planted with coffee, one of the other crops is dragon fruit. Lone Star grows only the S variety which is a hybrid of Liberica and Kent (typica) at  meters above sea level. This is one of the more popularly planted varieties planted in Myanmar. We did come across just a few yellow fruited plants, probably yellow catuai. We had tasted this coffee as a pourover on Monday at the MCG offices but it did not show quite as well on the cupping table, scoring . for me.
After Lone Star we headed to other side of Pyin Oo Lwin to Mr. Sai Wan’s farm, Green Land. One of the first things we see is Sai Wan’s nursery filled with SL , Sarchimor (a Costa Rica hybrid) and Panama Geisha! He also had macadamia and a type of shade tree called silver oak that was actually an evergreen. Most of the farm is planted with Sarchimor with a small amount dedicated to SL . He is planning on planting more SL  this year. A large portion of the coffee is washed and fermented  hours, though he has begun to do some small experimenting of naturals. Sai Wan had  coffees on this morning’s table and all  scored  points or higher. I scored his lots, , , and  respectively, the  lot being a naturally processed lot of sarchimor, great results for his first year of processing naturals!
Pyin Oo Lwin has been a great experience so far. Such big improvements are being made in a short period of time, though they still have a ways to go in overall quality. Tomorrow we head off to southern Shan, near Ywangan to visit the many small holders in the area.

We got off to an early start, as we had to leave for the airport in Yangon to fly to Mandalay, the old capitol of Mynmar. It was about a  hour flight to Mandalay, in the center of the country. It is hot and dry this time of year, like Yangon, with raining season beginning in April and May. We had a  hour drive up some very windy roads to the Pyin Oo Lwin area. 
As we made our way up the mountains, the temperatures cooled down but the landscape is still very dry this time of year. Our first stop was to the Mandalay Coffee Group and the Myanmar Coffee Association. The Mandalay Coffee Group is a group of local producers that received a grant from Winrock International to build a new wet mill and dry mill. It is state of the art and is among the nicest mills you will see in any coffee producing country. The wet mill has new fermentation tanks and most of the coffee is dried on concrete patios or raised beds. We had brief discussion there with many from the group. They were very enthusiastic about our visit.
From there we drive about  miles to visit our first farm of the trip, Shwe Pu Zun. As we drive up, we see very tall, skinny, evergreen like trees planted in between the rows of coffee. The trees are extremely shaded. We found out later that one reason the trees are so heavy is to keep the temperature of the farm more even since they have threat of frost in this area. They had a small wet mill where all the coffee is washed, some of demucilaged and some is pulped and goes through a  hour dry ferment before finishing the washing process. Shwe Pu Zun is about  acres planted in -. It is mostly planted with Catimor, S, and SL. There are probably a few other varieties mixed in, but they are for the most part sorted when picked and processed. Their annual production was about , pounds grown at about  meters above sea level.
The next farm we visited was about  acres and home to the nd place winner in the cupping competition last year, Sithar Farm. This farm is owned by Thu Zaw and his father in the law. The coffee is grown at about  meters and is a mixture of SL, Catimor, and S. This year, they are expected to produce about , pounds of green coffee. They also have future plans to expand the farm.
Overall it was a great first day getting introduced to Pyin Oo Lwin. There is much excitement about the possibility for specialty coffee here, and they have taken many steps to begin improving the process. We will learn more today as we move through the first round of cuppings.

Over the years, we've been recognized by a number of local agencies and media for our great coffee. It's nice to think that people are that fond of Kaldi's, but we know that being a leader in the community isn't just about sharing a quality product, it's also about sharing your resources. For us, that has included:
If you're interested in talking with Kaldi's about a community sponsorship or donation opportunity, please contact us.
The coffee trade is long and slow. To get that fresh cup of Kaldi's coffee to taste its best, we start by sourcing the world's finest beans. That means constantly traveling to origin to find better coffees and let farmers know what we want. 
Luckily, coffee is grown in many different places around the world. Each of these places has its own set of cultural habits regarding coffee cultivation. 
Coffee does grow on a tree. These trees produces small, grape-sized cherries that usually contain two seeds. These two seeds are what we will eventually roast and turn into coffee "beans."
To start with, different coffee producing regions grow different varietals of coffee that give each seed a unique flavor trait. Next, the coffee must be harvested from the trees. Picking ripe cherries instead of unripe cherries will vastly improve the final quality of a cup of coffee. Getting farmers to take this step of quality over quantity is one of the largest barriers to specialty coffee today.
After harvesting, the coffee fruit must be removed from the seeds. This process is done in a number of ways that involves fermentation, washing/cleaning, and drying. The type of processing used gives the coffee a very unique flavor and is usually based on cultural traditions.
Once the coffee beans are dry, they must go through a final milling process to remove a tough layer of skin surrounding the seed called parchment. The coffee is then sorted and cleaned.
Getting coffee to Saint Louis in a timely manner after harvest is also a challenge. The fresher the crop, the more delicious the cup. We have tried to improve upon this freshness by using new shipping materials that are less prone to aging, absorbing scents, and trapping moisture.
When the coffee finally arrives, we sample roast and cup it a number of times to determine a roast profile. Last, we do our best every day to preserve and present that quality to you.
Our Vision To be recognized and respected as one of the leading specialty coffee companies in the nation by providing an exceptional coffee experience to our customers and guests.

In th century Ethiopia, a goatherder named Kaldi stumbled upon his wandering flock as they sampled berries from nearby bushes. Ordinarily sluggish, his goats had an unusual amount of energy. After tasting several seeds himself, Kaldi discovered that the berries were the cause for the increased energy. It wasn’t long before coffee beans and their stimulating effect traveled far and wide.
Cupping is the industry term used to describe a professional coffee-tasting. Using this method, coffee is evaluated all around the world. We use this tool to select our coffees and train the palates of our staff.
Kaldi's supports many community organizations through donation. However, due to the large number of requests, we are not able to honor them all.
Requests for donation must be submitted three weeks before needed. Kaldi's reviews the requests as they are received, so you are encouraged to submit early.

We bought our first roaster in , set it up in the front window of our DeMun Coffeehouse, and started roasting the best coffees we'd ever tasted. Over the years, we've learned quite a bit more about this delicate process and we're happy to say we're still roasting the best coffees we've ever tasted. 
The process starts by selecting high-quality green (unroasted) coffees from the world's best farms and co-ops. We then develop a unique roast profile for each coffee based on its taste characteristics, density, and processing type.
Most of the coffees we roast are single origin coffees, meaning they come from one unique farm, mill, or co-op. Our goal when roasting these fine coffees is to accentuate the natural taste components inherent to each coffee. Dark-roasting a single origin coffee typically melts away the character and unique qualities for which we bought the coffee in the first place.
We also blend coffees together to create our signature blends, like Espresso  and Café Kaldi. These coffees are designed to fit a specific taste profile. The blend of coffees used to achieve that taste profile will change slightly throughout the year since coffees are seasonal.
Whether blend or single origin, each coffee is now roasted by one of our experienced coffee roasters using either our  Vintage -kilo Probat or our 's era -kilo Probat. Both roasters are top-of-the-line and feature cast iron pieces for added heat retention and fantastic air flow abilities.
Green (unroasted) coffee is "charged" into the roaster's spinning drum. The drum spins the coffee constantly to avoid it being burned by the bank(s) of natural-gas powered flames that heat it. The roaster is able to add or subtract heat to change the speed at which the coffee is roasted. During every roast, we monitor the temperature of the beans in the drum, the temperature of the exhaust, and gas pressure. By noting the changes in these marks over time, we can make many small adjustments to the gas pressure and air-flow to change a roast profile. Some coffees taste better with a short, fast roast, while others may come out better with a low-and-slow profile. 
Our attention to these small details with each coffee we produce is what makes Kaldi's Coffee unique and delicious. We know you'll taste it in the cup.
Kaldiʼs Relationship Coffees offer consumers the opportunity to take a proactive and global approach to their coffee purchasing decisions. Building on the success and wisdom of Fair Trade Certified, Kaldiʼs Relationship Coffees provide even greater transparency into the otherwise complex coffee transaction chain - from coffee grower to coffee lover.
Our philosophy is simple: premium-priced coffees should taste premium. With Kaldiʼs Relationship Coffees, we select with our palates, ensure that our farmer friends are rewarded for their efforts, and that the coffee is grown in a sustainable, ecologically sound manner.
Kosher foods are selected and prepared in accordance with traditional Jewish ritual and dietary laws. All of Kaldi’s Coffees are processed under supervision of the Vaad Hoeir of St. Louis, one of the world’s most respected kashrus agencies. While there is nothing inherently “un-kosher” about coffee in general, we invite a specially trained rabbi’s inspection of our roasting facility to ensure that our practices conform to the highest standards of cleanliness and purity. That inspection permits Kaldi’s to use the prestigious “OV” symbol  on our packaging – your guarantee that Kaldi’s Coffee meets that highest standards of cleanliness and kosher conformity. Even if you don’t observe kosher dietary prescriptions, these ancient traditions are considered by many to be among the most important food safety conventions in practice. For more information about kosher food, visit www.ovkosher.org.
In , we were one of the first retailers in St. Louis to offer certified Fair Trade Coffees. These coffees are monitored by Fair Trade Federation ensuring that at least a minimum sustainable wage was paid to the co-op at origin that exported the coffee. The Fair Trade minimum changes occasionally to reflect the economies and conditions at origin. We are happy to say that we have always and will always be paying at least this much for all of our coffees, and continue to improve upon the movement Fair Trade has started.
Over the last few years, we have started focusing on new programs (see Kaldi’s Relationship Coffees) that reward quality and taste as well as help small farmers who may not qualify for Fair Trade certification. These coffees are typically produced by small, independent farmers and co-ops who have started to build value based on the quality of their coffee rather than a certification.
Kaldi’s is a Certified Organic handler and processor of organic coffees and goods, meaning we buy and sell organic coffees and teas that have been grown without the use of harmful chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. In addition, and what most never realize, is that we follow a tedious and carefully-monitored set of specific operations when handling and packaging organic coffees and teas. Only then, when we follow these operations and pass our audits, can our coffee be offered as Certified Organic. Feel free to learn more via the USDA or through our certifying agent, Quality Assurance International.
When you place an order from us, our highest priority is sending you the freshest coffee possible. You deserve it, and frankly so do our world class coffee producers and their coffees.
If you order before noon on Monday - Thursday, your order will ship out the next day.
If you order after noon on Monday - Thursday, your order will ship out two days later.
For instance, if you order at am on a Monday, your order will ship out on Tuesday. However, if you order at pm on a Monday, your order will ship out Wednesday.
If your order Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, at any time, your order will ship out on Monday.
We ship flat rate USPS Priority Mail (or FedEx) for $. on all orders under $. Shipping is free for orders over $! USPS Priority Mail does not guarantee a certain delivery time, but is good at hitting the delivery times provided by the map below. Generally, if you live within the continental United States you will get your order within three days. 
We also can ship internationally and rush ship orders through FedEx. 
When do orders ship?When you place an order from us, our highest priority is sending you the freshest coffee possible. If you place an order Monday through Thursday, we will ship your order the following day; Orders placed on Friday will ship out the following Monday. This is to ensure the coffee we are sending you is as fresh as possible.
How to store coffee:There is great debate on whether to store coffee in the freezer, pantry, etc. Our recommendations are to store your coffee in a dry, cool, dark, and airtight place. Exposure to oxygen degrades coffee quicker and storing it outside of your freezer will ensure any neighboring ingredients don’t impose their flavor on your coffee.
Does coffee have an expiration date?Coffee doesn’t expire, but we recommend buying coffee as often as you buy your milk, bread, and eggs (so about every two weeks or so). Stocking up on large amounts of whole bean coffee will lead to coffee being used further away from its roast date. The sooner you brew coffee from when it was roasted, the fresher it is and the better it will taste.
Fair Trade Coffee:We have a selection of Fair Trade coffees available year round on our blends page. Sometimes, our single origin coffees will have a Fair Trade certification. All coffees we buy are bought at or above current Fair Trade prices. Our Kaldi’s Relationship Coffees are coffees with which we have a direct relationship with the coffee producer. We select coffees with our palates, ensure that our farmer friends are rewarded for their efforts, and that the coffee is grown in a sustainable, ecologically sound manner
Return Policy:We don’t accept any whole bean coffee returns, but we'll happily replace your coffee with another selection should you not enjoy your purchase. Any merchandise bought from our website can be returned to our roasting facility within  days for a full refund. Please note our cafes cannot accept returns for online purchases. For more individual assistance on this, please email us at roastmaster@kaldiscoffee.com.
What is the strongest/boldest/lightest coffee you have?Taste is very subjective. Equating roast profiles to flavor intensity only applies if you enjoy the flavor imposed on the coffee by its roast profile. For example: dark roasted coffees don’t necessarily have a stronger or bolder taste. When we roast our coffees, our goal is to bring out the inherent flavor of the green coffee we buy. That’s why our single origin coffees are all considered a light roast. We don’t want the roast profile to impose a taste on the coffee, but bring out those great, unique qualities.
What do your flavor notes mean?Taste descriptions on our non-flavored coffees are notes that we found were most prevalent within that unique coffee and can be used as a guide on notes you may experience when brewing. None of these coffees are flavored in any way, but should be thought of as taste experiences you would find outside of coffee. For example, Ethiopian coffees tend to have a light, tea-like drinking experience, but Central American coffees generally have a nutty-like sweetness. Your experience and taste notes you pick up on will likely be different than our’s and you should use our notes as a guide to choose coffees you think you would enjoy.
Why isn’t my favorite coffee being offered right now?Coffee is a seasonal crop and when we choose to offer coffees, we buy them at the peak of their season. Coffee crops by region vary throughout the year, so African coffees will be offered at different times than South American coffees. We only offer the best, so our current selection is among the highest quality coffees we could find at this given time.
What coffee is in your blends?When we create a blend, we choose coffees that fit a unique taste profile. Since coffee is seasonal, we’re constantly adjusting and modifying each blend to match that taste profile based on the coffees we currently have in stock. The taste of each blend should remain consistent year round, but you may notice some subtle differences from time-to-time.
Can I taste your coffee for free?Yes. We host a free weekly cupping at our roasting facility every Friday at p (holidays and some Fridays excluded) including a quick tour of our roasting facility. A coffee cupping is very similar to a wine tasting in that you will try a variety of coffees in a short amount of time. It is led by our roasting crew and a cupping is the same way we and coffee professionals evaluate coffees for purchase around the world. We'd love to have you visit us. How should I brew my coffee?There are a variety of exciting ways to brew coffee, all of which bring out unique qualities within you coffee. No matter how you brew your coffee, there are some standards that you should follow to get the best cup of coffee. We have guides for specific brewing methods available for download here.

Guaya’b is a cooperative of over  indigenous Mayan and Quichua farming families in the region of Jacaltenango, Huehuetenango. Since the introduction of coffee into the Jacaltenango region  years ago natural habitats, flora and fauna have slowly made a comeback from the once de-forested land. The recreation of the natural habitat has allowed for the reduction of soil erosion, restored natural habits and given the coffee crops a lush canopy that allows them to ripen slowly. Rich & delicately fruity; you’ll experience a thought provoking brew that begins with a chewy, chocolaty body that develops into a strawberry jaminess infused with deeper, bright fruit tones that suggest currant and raspberry.
Cupping notes : Red danjou pear, Raspberry honey, Malt-like body

Situated deep in the interior folds of the Southern Sierra Madre Mountains in Chiapas, Mexico is the coffee growing cooperative of Ramal Santa Cruz. Among this multitude of coffee farms lies the home of Augustin Sanchez Espinoza and his three brothers who all farm together on adjacent parcels of land. The farms of the Brothers Sanchez are at the upper reaches of viable coffee cultivation, starting at  meters and topping at just over  meters, the highest of all coffee grown in the cooperative. The family began planting coffee on the land in the early s. Many of the original plants are still producing. The majority of the coffee is Typica and Bourbon with a scattering of more recently planted Caturra.
The coffee from these four brothers and their farms make up our Mexico Fair Trade, Organic, Ramal Santa Cruz , Cuatro Hermanos.  This coffee greets you with a  red danjou pear citrus acidity followed with hints of raspberry honey and Meyer lemon.  We hope you will enjoy this extraordinarily smooth coffee from the Cuatro Hermanos.

Our Colombian El Diviso microlot, comes from producer Maximino Diaz’ small farm that sits in the Central Andes at a , foot elevation. The Tolima region, that is home to Maximino, is experiencing a transformation—from poverty and violence, due to the Colombian conflict, to a rebounding market for their high quality beans, offering a vehicle of change for its people.
In addition to producing fine coffee beans, Maximino is dedicated to nurturing his land and its wildlife. He not only grows sustenance crops such as maize and beans, he has also created a small nature reserve that provides a nesting site for the Colombian chachalaca.  This turkey-like, native bird is not endangered but has seen a continual declining population. It is Maximino’s commitment to give back to the land that has been so generous to him.
El Diviso is a complex coffee with cinnamon and milk chocolate aromas ,  mandarin and meyer lemon acidity and smooth cashew butter undertones.

To drink a cup of Ethiopia Nigusse Lemma is to connect with the origins of coffee.  Beans from Ethiopia’s Limu woreda (district) deliver unique flavors that can only be discovered in heirloom varietals.  Located in the southwestern part of country, Limu is not as well known as Yirgacheffe or Harrar, but deserves the attention that it is receiving.
Our Ethiopia Niguisse Lemma is sourced from the family farm of Lemma Edeto and is located in the highest elevations of the Limu region.  Shade from old growth trees, water from spring fed stream, and native varietal of coffee that flourish organically are in no better hands than the Edeto Family.  Lemma, with over  years in the coffee industry, has passed down the knowledge to his sons Nigusse and Haile, who operate the farm which their father recovered after it was confiscated by the Derg regime in the ’s.  The family’s commitment to quality includes a fully natural dry processing that insures no unripend cherries taint the taste of the finished product.  Fully control from farming to milling has resulted in award-winning coffee.  Nigusse and family were recently honored for the African Taste of the Harvest competition awarded by the African Fine Coffee Association.

This coffee comes to us from the farm of Welser Hernandez, just outside the town of Jacaltenango in the Huehuetenango Region of Guatemala. It’s here that Mr. Hernandez grows and processes his coffee—in the Sierra Madre Mountains that lie in the Western Highlands of the country. Though growing altitudes range from ,-, feet, the dry, hot winds from the Mexican plains fend off the threat of frost, naturally protecting the vegetation. After harvest, the beans—predominantly Bourbons and Caturra—are fully washed, then sundried, yielding the coffee bean that we call “Guatemala Mr. Hernandez”, in honor of his commitment to quality.

Our Sumatra Samosir Honey is a unique lot. It is the result of collaboration by three coffee growers from the Lake Toba region of Northern Sumatra. What makes this lot different lies in the coffee processing. Sumatran growers are known for using the unique process of “wet hulling” coffee. But these Lake Toban farmers have taken a still different approach using what is know as the “honey” process—a process originated in Central America but rarely used in Asia. The differences are not only interesting, they result in an entirely different flavor profile.
The Wet Hulled Process, common to most Sumatran coffees, begins with the coffee being pulped and washed. This removes the sugary mucilage layer, as is done with all washed coffees. The difference with wet hulled coffees is, the beans are removed from their protective parchment layer before they have been allowed to fully dry. This premature exposure of the beans results in Sumatran coffee’s distinctive musty, earthy flavors. The Honey Process, used in producing this Sumatran, is named for the sticky mucilage found once the coffee cherry skin is removed. It is sometimes referred to as “honey”. During the Honey Process, coffee is fully dried with the sugary mucilage before the sugar laden parchment is removed from the bean. The result is a coffee with good sweetness and body but with flavors that are cleaner than traditional Sumatran coffee.

We think you'll find 
			        that Mr. Espresso strikes the delicate balance between time-honored traditional methods and a burning desire 
			        to advance our craft. The result is a flavor with an Italian passion and soul, comfortably residing within the 
			        Bay Area’s culture of specialty coffee 'conoscenti'.

Three exceptional light roasted coffees from three different continents
A light roast, a medium roast, and a dark roasted blend
The most common source of fuel used to supply a coffee roaster with heat is gas. We are, however, the first and only roaster in the United States to roast coffee beans exclusively over a fire fueled by Oak Wood. The differences are not what one might initially expect. Unlike cooking with a wood oven or grill, where the smoke from the wood imparts a flavor to the final product, the main difference between wood and conventional roasting lies in the quality of the heat delivered to the beans. Heat derived from wood has higher moisture content and is better suited for slow roasting.
The more oil preserved within the bean, the more exquisite the final flavor will be. The natural humidity within the wood seems to envelop the beans during the roasting process, hence preserving more of the lipids within. Meanwhile, the slow roasting aspect ensures the coffee is lower in acidity and higher in body. The result is most apparent in our espresso, yielding more crema, fuller flavor, and a smoother finish. For drip coffee for which we actually wish to retain the acidity of the coffees, we subject the beans to a faster roasting time.
The unique advantages of wood roasting do not come without challenges, as the use of such an inconsistent fuel (i.e. wood) creates difficulties in maintaining consistency between roasts. A nightmare for an inexperienced operator, years of experience of roasting with wood are required to develop the intuition and instinct necessary to master the process. Luckily for us, with  years of wood roasting under our belt, we are able to claim this as an advantage; since through the unpredictable nature of roasting with wood, we are required to be attentive and obsessive with each and every roast: nothing can replace the skilled guidance of our experienced roasters. However, never the ones to be overconfident, we still go through extra steps to ensure consistency and quality.
We begin by selecting well seasoned wood from responsible suppliers. We then utilize thermocouple data collected at key locations on the roaster along with VFD motor control, which allows to make fan and drum speed adjustments during the roasting process. The wood smoke emissions are then abated by high powered afterburners which are in full compliance with local air quality standards. Combining these tools with our years of experience, we are able to maintain control of the roasting process with a very high level of consistency. As you can see, wood roasting is an artisan craft where human experience using old world methods, combined with the latest technological advances in roasting, delicately blend art and science. We hope you will enjoy a distinctive coffee experience which is impossible to duplicate.

Dry fragrance is marked by molasses sugars and malt grain, barley malt is what comes to mind in City roasts. Full City roasts see a slight uptick in fruited tones, but soft in comparison to the layers of sugar and cocoa. Adding hot water gives off a sense of bittersweetDutch cocoa powder in the steam, with balancing raw sugar smells. The cup is no far cry from what is sensed in the aroma: solid and straight-forward muscovado sugar sweetness, an undercurrent of powdered cocoa, and accents of malted barley grain. As the temperature cools down a bit, subtle fruit tones come into view, like dried cherry and golden raisin, coming through most in terms of acidity.

This process is known as E.A. Sugarcane. It starts by fermenting molasses to create ethanol and combining it with acetic acid–found in vinegar–to make ethyl acetate. This is added to water, and applied to the green coffee to dissolve the caffeine completely out of the beans. The caffeine is separated from the greens and is steamed and washed with more water.
This is truly an exceptional cup of coffee with flavors of citrus, caramel, and honey.

Dry fragrance is marked by molasses sugars and malt grain, barley malt is what comes to mind in City roasts. Full City roasts see a slight uptick in fruited tones, but soft in comparison to the layers of sugar and cocoa. Adding hot water gives off a sense of bittersweetDutch cocoa powder in the steam, with balancing raw sugar smells. The cup is no far cry from what is sensed in the aroma: solid and straight-forward muscovado sugar sweetness, an undercurrent of powdered cocoa, and accents of malted barley grain. As the temperature cools down a bit, subtle fruit tones come into view, like dried cherry and golden raisin, coming through most in terms of acidity.

This process is known as E.A. Sugarcane. It starts by fermenting molasses to create ethanol and combining it with acetic acid–found in vinegar–to make ethyl acetate. This is added to water, and applied to the green coffee to dissolve the caffeine completely out of the beans. The caffeine is separated from the greens and is steamed and washed with more water.
This is truly an exceptional cup of coffee with flavors of citrus, caramel, and honey.

We’ve had the pleasure of working with the Desarrollo producer group in the town of Gigante, Colombia, for a number of years now, so we’re happy to announce the launch of Los Gigantes Decaf. 
In an effort to create a decaf that matches the caliber of our regular offerings, we pre-selected coffees with a bright and sweet profile before they are sent to be decaffeinated. At the Descafecol plant in Manizales, the caffeine is removed, as though by magic, using naturally occurring Ethyl Acetate derived from sugar cane. You'll find Ethyl Acetate in green coffee as well as various fruits, and it is the most common ester in wine.  
The resulting coffee is intensely sweet and fruited both in aroma and flavor, with notes of banana bread, preserved cherries, and chocolate pudding!
Need a quick and thoughtful gift for a host (or just want to treat yourself)? This sweet duo is just the thing:
•The Classic Ritual Mug or a Pillarbox Red Falcon Enamelware Mug  (let us know in the comments :)
•A  oz-bag of the coffee that our head roaster deems worthy of your generous heart!
Our newest coffee from Rwanda comes from the community of Kanyege, located in the southwestern mountains of the country, near Lake Kivu. Bourbon variety coffee cherries are grown on small, privately owned farms before being delivered to the Kanyege washing station. This coffee is an interesting mix of round, comforting flavors underlying a racy fruit acidity. Look for flavors of peach nectar and lemon brisk tea, sitting atop a warm background of hazelnuts and cocoa nibs.
Nyeri County, situated right between the slopes of Mount Kenya and the lush Aberdare National Park, is one of the world's most renowned coffee growing regions. With high altitude, rich volcanic soil, and ample access to fresh clean water, the terroir is perfect for growing great tasting coffees. As is typical in this region, this lot is the product of many small-holder farmers, who work collectively at the Kiamania factory. At the factory, the coffee is carefully fermented, washed and dried on raised beds, with special attention paid to sorting out the absolute best at every stage of the process. The result is a very floral cup of coffee, with clean flavors of raspberry, cherry and lime.
Nelson is an exceptional and unusual coffee producer for the El Cielito region. He’s a trained agronomist and botanist, and manages his expansive farm in a very professional manner, densely planting his Catuai variety trees in manicured rows to maximize production. While we typically associate big production yields with diminished quality, Nelson very carefully monitors his plants, driving up from the village daily in an old Dodge truck to insure they are all healthy and vigorous.
Nicknaming the farm “Chely”, after his mother, shows a softer side of Nelson that isn’t all business, and his sense of humor is as honed and effective as his growing practices. The fruits of all this labor are tremendously sweet, with a light nuanced acidity that has become a hallmark of great coffees from this region. Nelson has done much to challenge notions of traditional coffee cultivation, but it’s hard to disagree with his delicious results. 
In the Haight-Ashbury scene of the s, “side door” became a kind of stand-in term for the transgression of norms in a tumultuous period. It also signified a different way of looking at things, an alternative that, like many, would become suspiciously mainstream. It is in that revolutionary Aquarian spirit we offer you our Spring seasonal espresso blend, “Side Door.”
In the world of coffee, Brasil has always conjured up the image of ‘body.’ The coffees that hail from this country are heavy, sweet, and bring the creamy viscosity that are reminiscent of some of the best memories of espresso. The two Brasils featured in this blend are no different.
Located in the Cerrado growing region of the Brasilian state of Minas Gerais, the Recanto expresses the classic profile from this terroir: soft, sweet fruits layered on a bed of chocolate and nuts. Unlike much of the coffee of the Cerrado, the Recanto is tank fermented and washed, imparting a nicer acidity and providing greater nuance to the cup. Look for flavors of brown sugar, dried peach and roasted walnuts.
Brazil Fazenda Sertaozinho Yellow Bourbon Pulped Natural + GrainPro coffee is sourced from Fazenda Sertãozinho, an estate located in the municipality of Botelhos, within the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The estate has  hectares of protected forest with towering old growth trees called Jequitibá Rosa (Cariniana legalis), which are  meters tall and estimated to be more than , years old. ​
The other half of ‘Side Door’ is a duo of African coffees, representing the more experimental, bright side of the blend. The Rwandan Cotecaga is always a favorite around here with its foundation of the sweetness of graham cracker and higher notes of grilled watermelon and lime.
Our fourth component, Konyu heads into the mix. Konyu hails from Kenya, and provides a bright fruited melody to the ‘Door,’ with notes of peach, blood orange, and a silky body. 
This quartet of coffees comes together in the following manner: a fruit-flower accord of watermelon, lime and jasmine on top; a rich and smooth texture like ganache in the middle; and an overwhelmingly cookie-like sweetness. That is to say, it’s balanced in a way that some other blends can only hope to be. It can be sweet, easygoing, and traditional; yet forward-looking, experimental and far-out - all while staying quintessentially “Ritual.”

The Souza family has long been part of what we do here at Ritual. For years João Souza, affectionately called Ziñho amongst his friends and family, had been doing things a bit differently in Brasil. After the devastating 'Black' frost of  and the subsequent skyrocketing of coffee prices all over Brasil, farmers started turning their focus to producing coffee for volume. Ever a man of tradition, Ziñho kept producing coffee the way his father taught him, and in turn, passed on his talent and wisdom to his children and grandchildren. Today, his son Bruno works the land in the same way as his father, picking coffee only when at its peak, processing cherries carefully in small batches, and ultimately striving for the best coffee he can produce - not just the most coffee he can produce. This Sweet Tooth offering is a blend of Rubi and Catuaí cherries dried carefully over - days in the natural method and then milled directly on the farm. The care in producing this spectacular offering comes through with amazing clean and complex flavors - look for notes of ripe peach and apricot brightened with a light orange acidity over a backdrop of syrupy sweet milk chocolate.
As a roaster that is committed to promoting our producers and bringing them out of anonymity, single origin espresso has always been important to us. The best shots of espresso we've ever had have been single origin--dynamic, sweet, and complex. They are balanced, and good in milk to boot.
Throughout the year we will be showcasing eight to twelve single producers in homage to our original Sweet Tooth blend. An anti-blend that explicitly showcased the producers whose coffees comprised it. Sweet Tooth will be a rotating single origin on which we've put our stamp of approval as a great shot of espresso.
Let our roaster pick our three freshest and favorite-ist single-origin coffees for you. We promise you’ll love every one.

Our green buying team constructed this regional lot while cupping dozens of freshly harvested coffees in Antigua at Bella Vista Mill in January. In our search, small producer lots from Chimaltenango stood out as the most fruited, vibrant and sweet coffees available. To present the best possible offering, we decided upon constructing this blend from our three top-scoring lots. Chimaltenango is a central region in Guatemala and possesses many of the ideal characteristics to produce exceptional coffees:  to  meters of altitude paired with a vast majority of Caturra and Bourbon varieties make for a solid foundation of quality. This cup leads with aromatics and flavors of toffee and nougat and continues to become more vibrant as it cools with a dynamic display of flavors ranging from black cherry to milk chocolate to cashew butter.

Kiumu landed stateside early this year thanks in part to the collaboration with our export partners in Kenya. Kiumu represents the next chapter in our mission to develop a quality-founded relationship coffee with a single estate producer in the region. Last year, this budding exploration brought us to Muranga County. During our travels we were fortunate to meet John Njoroge, who owns and personally manages Kiumu, a parcel of a  acre estate which he shares with his brothers. Parlor is in the nascent stage of an exclusive relationship with John: we purchased every one of John’s Kiumu lots this year because we believe in the potential of this coffee. John Njoroge’s Kiumu is ripe with flavors coveted in the finest Kenyan coffees: juicy stone fruits meld with citrus notes and make way for a remarkable flavor of fresh blackberry. We are excited for the evolution of this relationship coffee throughout this season and for seasons to come.

Spyhouse Coffee Roasters is incredibly proud of our Director of Coffee, Tony Querio, for taking st place overall in the  U.S. Roaster Championship this past week, as part of the SCAA Expo in Atlanta, GA. The annual U.S. Roaster Championship (formerly the Roasters Choice Competition) is designed to highlight the art and craft of coffee roasting. This year’s event was determined by input from both a panel of judges and attendees, who then voted on/scored each offering. Every competitor was given the same green coffee to roast for the first round, and a coffee of the roaster’s choosing was provided for round two.
Our selection for this competition came from producer Juan Peña’s farm, La Papaya, in Saraguro, Southern Ecuador. The strength of our relationship with this producer and coffee makes the award that much sweeter, and we couldn’t be happier to share this honor. 
Juan Peña is a very rare example of a completely unique coffee producer. His story and his coffee are like none other. Rather than continuing in a multi-generation path to coffee farming, Juan’s story with coffee began just a five years ago in an area where coffee trees have never existed before. His family’s hacienda had been producing long-stemmed roses for years, but a massive off-season rainstorm destroyed all the plants, causing him to replant the property with Typica, one of the two original cultivated coffee varieties. Applying unique practices he developed in his years producing ornamental flowers, Juan individually fertilizes each plant through a complicated irrigation system. This system causes the plants to act as if they are always peak production. The strain on his plants, from constantly being in production, creates an incredibly dynamic and complex cup, unlike any other coffee in the world. In only five years, Juan has already produced three full harvests. We were able to visit his farm during the most recent harvest and have been able to purchase his top lot for each of his three production cycles.
We have just finished releasing an all new menu of single origin offerings for the Spring. Please allow us to introduce them to you.

Within the well respected micro region of Pedegral lies a small village, Agua Blanca. Cousins Walter and Juvenal Penna are the shining producers of this “jewel in the crown” that is Agua Blanca. In the highest elevations of Agua Blanca both producers operate their own farms and washing stations maintaining the same standards as the other. Beyond their exceptional practices, one of the other secrets to their quality is the combined varietal makeup. Walter produces Typica and Yellow Bourbon while Juvenal grows exclusively Caturra – a combination rarely seen in Colombia. This is the second year we have worked with Walter & Juvenal and are proud to be able to offer their coffees once again. Never have we experienced a coffee carry such a similar flavor profile over two years. The cousin’s skilled farming practices and processing techniques come together to make a consistently amazing coffee that we love both brewed and served as a single origin espresso.
Agua Blanca starts off with sweet fruit tones of ripe strawberry, orange and peach and an underlying menthol-like herbaliness that reminds us of wild wintergreen. Cooling, the cup richens into flavors of milk chocolate and toffee, similar to Toblerone bars. This coffee, just like last year, is full of candied fruit tones such as preserved cherries and orange, which combined with the sweeter wine finish, reminds us of the Minnesota classic - the brandy old fashion. It is the perfect coffee to toast the hard work and continued excellence of those around you.
The Highlands of Papua New Guinea are stocked with challenges toward quality coffee production. Due to the immense diversity of indigenous tribes, many of which had no interaction with the western world until the ’s, there are over  distinct languages spoken throughout the country. The majority of mills that still operate were originally installed on massive commodity grade plantations in the ’s with seeds from Jamaica’s Blue Mountain. Today, % of coffee is grown by smallholder farmers, each owning anywhere between just a couple to a couple hundred trees.
Kunjin operates a mill they lease on one of the original  coffee plantations, but purchases cherry from substance farmers in the Waghi Valley. They are able to control quality throughout the milling process, cupping day lots and building micro lot level containers to be processed separately.
Kunjin is a beautifully complex and dynamic. Ripe plum initially comes to the forefront, offset by lime zest and a bouquet of sweet herbs. As it cools, the cup maintains its liveliness and picks up notes of white grape, coming together into a beautiful winey finish. This coffee is the highest quality lot we have seen from PNG, if not all of the Asian-Pacific region, and just may reshape your impression of the region. It is the perfect coffee for pairing with buttery pastries, whether sweet or savory. 
The climate and geography of Eastern Congo are a dream for growing coffee. However, to live in Congo is truly a nightmare. 
Lake Kivu comes to us from the over , members of the Sopacdi cooperative, on the shores of Lake Kivu. Most of these farmers have recently returned to their homes after being driven away by the rebel troops spilling over from Rwanda. Over twenty percent of the cooperative’s membership are women. Many are widows whose husbands died trying to smuggle their coffee into Rwanda while the Conogolese market was virtually non-exsistent. They live in small, remote villages in the mountainous highlands surrounding Lake Kivu. The cooperative is headquartered in the village of Minova, where they just completed building the first coffee washing-station in Congo in over forty years. Additionally, this is the first coffee from DR Congo to acheive the top national grade - Kivu  - since .
Lake Kivu’s first sip springs forward with tones of fresh cherry, developing into notes of fresh-cut flowers, clementine, peach, and buttery pie crust. As the cup cools, the floral tones open up into earthy green tea acting as a nice foundation for the brighter, sweet fruit we see in the forefront. This coffee is very juicy, turning into a slightly dry effervescent mouth-feel in the finish which reminded us of Bottle Cap candies. It is the perfect coffee to greet the oncoming summer sunshine.
We are very pleased to announce the release of our latest Imperial Reserve offering from Colombian Cup of Excellence winner, Luis Morales.Luis Hernando Morales Arias was born in Bogata, Colombia but moved with his mother to Gaitania at age  to collect her paternal inheritance. Growing up in the country, he was immersed in the coffee growing culture, spending his life advancing his coffee cultivation knowledge. Luis has seen his participation in the Cup of Excellence as a way for him to continue his education. This dedication to improving his skill has deffinitely paid off as this lot, La Esmerelda, placed th in the Colombian national competition. La Esmerelda is operated by Luis, his wife, and their two children.The Cup of Excellence was created by the Alliance for Coffee Excellence to find and reward the highest quality coffee producers in each country that it operates. International judges volunteer to blindly taste and score submissions through multiple rounds, ultimately selecting the top twenty coffees. The winners are then placed in an auction for buyers to bid on their desired lots. The premiums a high-placing winner can receive are often life changing.Luis Morales starts off with rich, juicy cherry and chocolate notes and carries a heavy lingering finish like a well-aged rum. As it cools, more floral, citric, and spiced notes come forward. This coffee is incredibly complex, yet very approachable and fitting for the season. It is the perfect coffee for enjoying with family this Holiday season.Available now at any of our cafes and online.
Otilio Leiva returns to us for the second year in a row. Through five tables of offering in our sourcing trip last year, Otilio stood out as a top selection. We were later surprised to learn that it was the first year Beneficio San Vicente isolated his harvest to produce a single producer lot based on his improving quality. San Vicente is an exceptional, quality driven mill run by the Paz family. The micro-lot program is handled by Benjamin, who maintains clear communication between producers and roasters, while the quality control operations are maintained by his cousin Arturo. Each member of the Paz family are themselves among the top producers of Honduras who share their experience and knowledge with the many producers in their network. The Los Andes region is incredibly slick and steep; often requiring mules to carry the daily harvests down the single-track trail. In his first year producing a micro-lot Otilio only produced  exportable bags, however this year he was able increase his output to . We are honored to be once again offering Otilio Leiva’s crop and be a part of his growth as we see his coffee improve.
Otilio Leiva starts off tasting of fresh peach and buttery pie crust, developing into notes of blackberries stewed in white wine. There is a long lingering finish of fresh herbs such as mint, thyme, and sage. This coffee carries the rich stonefruit tones we first fell in love with, but shows the clarity of another year of farm improvements. It is the perfect coffee to sip as you celebrate the relationships in your life this time of year.
José Amado Fernández is a historically exceptional producer. He placed first in the  Honduran Cup of Excellence, and sixth in . Don Amado, the farm’s namesake and José’s father, passed this farm down to his four sons. Each son inherited his own lot, but share a central facility for washing and processing. The brothers individually oversee their own parcel and process their coffee separately. José Amado Fernández’s parcel is . hectares and directly overlooks Lake Yojoa, the largest in Honduras. Our relationship with José began with us visiting his farm during the harvest of . He had one of the cleanest and most organized farms we have ever seen. That attention to detail on a farm level carries throughout his production resulting in a beautiful cup. We have been able to commit to purchasing José’s second harvest each year and are proud to bring this back in for the second time. The peach notes and richness carries over from last year, but we are seeing significantly more complexity and improvement in the cup quality overall. Don Amado initially tastes like spiced chocolate and dark nuts, but as it cools the sweetness moves more forward, creating a much more complex cup. The interaction between the spiced nut tones and light carameliness remind us of traditional pecan pie; finishing with a rich stonefruit note similar to peach infused sweet tea. This coffee is dense, complex, and fitting for the season. It is the perfect coffee for these cooler fall mornings.
The Aguilera Brothers manage six farms and their own micro-mill operation entirely within the family, with the exception of a few pickers during the harvest season. The  brothers and sisters inherited the farms from their parents and are now incorporating the third generation into the family business. Each of their farms is planted almost exclusively with Villa Sarchi, a mutation of Bourbon native to the region. This dwarf varietal is known for high production yields and often carries exceptionally floral cupping notes and elegant, tropical fruit acidities. Many Villa Sarchi coffees can be unbalanced in their intensity, but each coffee we have tasted from the Aguilera Brothers has been far more refined than any other from this region. Last year we were able to begin our relationship with the Aguilera Brothers when Tony – our green buyer – visited the farms to meet the family and bought a honey processed lot from Finca Angelina. This year we are honored to serve this washed selection from Finca Chayote, located  meters higher in elevation on their most picturesque property. Finca Chayote starts off pear-like with soft herbal notes that develop into honeyed floral lemon tones very similar to an elderflower cordial. This coffee also has an intriguing mouthfeel that starts off very silky and syrupy but turns effervescent with a sweet, lingering finish. It is the perfect coffee for sipping while sitting on a dock, overlooking a calm lake.
Don Ignacio Gutierrez has been El Salvador’s Cup of Excellence Champion in , , and . The family transitioned to coffee production in  after a long history of growing wood trees and tomatoes. Their first two farms, Los Positos and La Roxanita, consisted of just  trees. Their land’s sandy loam soil and skilled farming practice lead them to great success in a short amount of time. Each year’s COE winnings were invested back into their farms, allowing them to continually improve harvests. Winning a single COE is an impressive achievement in it’s own right; to win three within five years is an exceptional feat. The lot that began the Gutierrez family’s legacy was the  harvest of this microlot, Finca La Roxanita’s honey processed pacamara. The region of Chalatenango has built a solid reputation for amazing honey processed pacamaras and this farm is one that laid that foundation. 
Ignacio Gutierrez’s honey pacamara from Finca La Roxanita starts bright and fruity with notes of ripe blackberry and allspice. As it develops on the palate there are complex  tones of grilled pineapple, vanilla, and lime with a slight resinous nature that together reminds us of a bright California chardonnay aged on new oak. This coffee is dynamic and complex, but is in no way off-putting. It is the perfect coffee to showcase the mastery Ignacio applies to coffee production, allowing him to be one of the most consistent and  outstanding producers in coffee today.
RespectYou go through life meeting a million people, especially in the hospitality industry, and even more so after founding Spyhouse  years ago. You rarely meet someone that you immediately can connect with, both on a personal level, but also on a professional one. When you do meet that person, it is a connection that will hopefully be lifelong. I felt this during Laila's visit to Spyhouse.
Meet Laila Ghambari, @lay_luh, Director of Coffee at Cherry Street Coffee in Seattle, who spent the last week in May with us. Her confident stature, bar prowess, and an operational understanding of precision and clarity were what inspired me to reach out to her. She is not only one to look up to in the coffee industry, but one to look up to in any industry. She is not only one to look up to as one of the leading women in coffee, but one of the leading persons in coffee. Laila is a testament to a strong work ethic while performing professionally with devotion, passion, and unwavering attention to detail. Thank you, Laila, for all your inspiration and insight. See you soon! - Christian, Founder/Owner Spyhouse Coffee Roasters
I’ve been with Spyhouse for just over two years. I started as a barista at the Hennepin location, and got to watch with envy as Tony crafted a spectacular in-house roasting program for a company that was previously a multi-roaster shop. My love for coffee and restless desire for knowledge craved nothing more than to work directly with Tony, and learn and apprentice under him.
In January of , that wish was granted when I was made a roasting and packaging assistant. Five short months later, I was full time in the roasting department acting as a production roaster and packaging manager. I was honored to have been lifted to that position in such a short time.
I never thought that within that brief period I’d be given an opportunity to travel to origin. For that, I’m incredibly grateful.
This trip, hosted by Café Imports, brought Christian (owner) and I to the city of Xalapa in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. We and several others from roasting companies across the US were to judge a national coffee competition that Café Imports has been organizing over the last few years to help bring prestige to the hard working coffee producers in Mexico who are often overlooked by the specialty coffee industry. It’s called “Lo Mejor De Mexico” ­– literally, “The Best of Mexico”.
Lo Mejor De Mexico has special significance to us at Spyhouse. Last year, two of our employees– Kathie, our educator; and Kimberly, a barista– competed in the Big Central regional Barista Championship with a coffee from Ixhautlán, Mexico, that won rd place in last year’s Lo Mejor competition. Those who are regulars might remember it for its killer espresso profile and elegantly balanced brew character. It was truly a coffee that could bring a smile to anyone, and we like to think it helped changed some preconceived notions of Mexican coffee.
This year’s competition took place over two days in the Beneficio Las Animas wet mill. Entries from all over Mexico were submitted, and Café Imports’ team narrowed around  submissions down to half that for the scored and judged rounds. The first day consisted of  rounds of cupping, each judge filling out score sheets based around dry fragrance, wet aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, sweetness, and an overall cupper’s score.
Between each around, every cupper shared his or her scores and thoughts for each coffee. Soon, a top  emerged.
The next day, the  advancing coffees were re-roasted and re-cupped. There was a palpable tension in the air amongst the echoing slurps as each cupper focused intently on grading and evaluating every coffee they tasted. After all, we were deciding the best coffee in Mexico– a heavy decision.
Results were tabulated, information was disbursed, and an award ceremony was held later that night. This year brought about a first for the Lo Mejor competition: a live auction of the top  winning coffees. Producers who placed in the top  were invited to the ceremony to receive congratulations and awards from AMSA, another organizer of Lo Mejor and a company dedicated to enriching and enhancing coffee farming in Mexico.
Intense bidding ensued, and the farmers who produced such spectacular coffees were rewarded with a price per pound well above average market value (as well as the aforementioned prizes from AMSA). When the dust finally settled, each and every representative of the present US roasteries had a huge grin on their face and an appetite that could only be satiated by tacos and tequila– both of which were aplenty after the auction.
We at Spyhouse won  bags total in the auction, each bag being kg/~lbs:  of the  total bags of the st Place coffee, GRAPOS El Porvenir; and the entire  bag lot of El Amate, the th Place coffee (though both Christian and I scored El Amate as our rd favorite coffee overall).
Between rounds of cupping, we spent much of our time traveling to other significant coffee-related sites around the area. The Dos Rios dry mill we visited is responsible for the sorting and final preparation of coffee received from various wet mills around the region. Additionally, Dos Rios has a large coffee nursery where scientists are working on creating genetic hybrids of Robusta plants and specialty-grade Arabica plants in an effort to fight the roya (rust) leaf disease that has been devastating many Central and South American coffee farms. Robusta plants are incredibly disease resistant and high producing, and this hybridization process (known as embryogenesis) is able to create a coffee plant with the exceptional heartiness Robusta is known for while retaining the complex and delicious cup character of Arabica.
We also visited the farms of two producers who entered the Lo Mejor competition. Finca Consopalan and Finca Fatima are both a short drive from Xalapa in the region of Coatepec. Though Mexico’s harvest season is over, there were still many flowering and fruited plants on the farms. The beauty of both farms was immeasurable, and the care and dedication of their respective producers– both of whom we met– was instantly noticeable.
Our first and foremost mission at Spyhouse is to responsibly source amazing coffees and build direct relationships with excellent producers. Our commitment to this shows in the coffees we buy out of major growing regions like Costa Rica, Colombia, Guatemala, Ethiopia, etc. Additionally, we strongly believe in developing and encouraging excellent coffee in passed-over regions like Peru, Ecuador, and Mexico. Since the inception of our roasting program, we’ve made it a point to work closely with producers in these areas to help maximize their potential and bring you, the customer, the best coffee possible.
We hope you enjoy drinking these coffees as much as we enjoyed sourcing and buying them for you. Look for them in our offerings list in the next few months.

Strawberry Tart / Toblerone / Wintergreen / Shirley Temple
Within the well respected micro region of Pedegral lies a small village, Agua Blanca. Cousins Walter and Juvenal Penna are the shining producers of this “jewel in the crown” that is Agua Blanca. In the highest elevations of Agua Blanca both producers operate their own farms and washing stations maintaining the same standards as the other. Beyond their exceptional practices, one of the other secrets to their quality is the combined varietal makeup. Walter produces Typica and Yellow Bourbon while Juvenal grows exclusively Caturra – a combination rarely seen in Colombia. This is the second year we have worked with Walter & Juvenal and are proud to be able to offer their coffees once again. Never have we experienced a coffee carry such a similar flavor profile over two years. The cousin’s skilled farming practices and processing techniques come together to make a consistently amazing coffee that we love both brewed and served as a single origin espresso.
Agua Blanca starts off with sweet fruit tones of ripe strawberry, orange and peach and an underlying menthol-like herbaliness that reminds us of wild wintergreen. Cooling, the cup richens into flavors of milk chocolate and toffee, similar to Toblerone bars. This coffee, just like last year, is full of candied fruit tones such as preserved cherries and orange, which combined with the sweeter wine finish, reminds us of the Minnesota classic - the brandy old fashion. It is the perfect coffee to toast the hard work and continued excellence of those around you.
Division was designed to exhibit the fervor of mulitple elements in alliance, creating a rich & complex profile of dark sugars. We crafted this offering on the foundation of rich chocolate and caramel notes with just enough sweet, dark fruit overtones to make it an exceptionally versatile coffee. Primarily intended to serve as a brewed offering, this coffee has been shaped to serve as a Fair-Trade & Organic alternative to Orion, our flagship espresso.
Division was created to be paired with food. The rich body holds up well against heavier traditional breakfast items. Inversely the fruit tones are held in careful balance to compliment a wide range of pastries and desserts. Although sweetness is clearly present in the cup, it is not overpowering. We created this offering to showcase the versatility of a carefully balanced cup. This makes Division an exceptional choice for cafes and restaurants looking for a “work horse” coffee. We like to think of this offering as the nicest “diner coffee” you will ever find; perfect for bookending your day.
Although the elements shift occasionally to reflect the seasonality of coffee harvests, we are careful in our selection of what we pair in Division. While looking for rich, sugared tones we make sure we are working with a seasonally rotating selection of reputable cooperatives, known for consistent quality and fair practices. 
The Highlands of Papua New Guinea are stocked with challenges toward quality coffee production. Due to the immense diversity of indigenous tribes, many of which had no interaction with the western world until the ’s, there are over  distinct languages spoken throughout the country. The majority of mills that still operate were originally installed on massive commodity grade plantations in the ’s with seeds from Jamaica’s Blue Mountain. Today, % of coffee is grown by smallholder farmers, each owning anywhere between just a couple to a couple hundred trees.
Kunjin operates a mill they lease on one of the original  coffee plantations, but purchases cherry from substance farmers in the Waghi Valley. They are able to control quality throughout the milling process, cupping day lots and building micro lot level containers to be processed separately.
Kunjin is a beautifully complex and dynamic. Ripe plum initially comes to the forefront, offset by lime zest and a bouquet of sweet herbs. As it cools, the cup maintains its liveliness and picks up notes of white grape, coming together into a beautiful winey finish. This coffee is the highest quality lot we have seen from PNG, if not all of the Asian-Pacific region, and just may reshape your impression of the region. It is the perfect coffee for pairing with buttery pastries, whether sweet or savory. 
The climate and geography of Eastern Congo are a dream for growing coffee. However, to live in Congo is truly a nightmare. 
Lake Kivu comes to us from the over , members of the Sopacdi cooperative, on the shores of Lake Kivu. Most of these farmers have recently returned to their homes after being driven away by the rebel troops spilling over from Rwanda. Over twenty percent of the cooperative’s membership are women. Many are widows whose husbands died trying to smuggle their coffee into Rwanda while the Conogolese market was virtually non-exsistent. They live in small, remote villages in the mountainous highlands surrounding Lake Kivu. The cooperative is headquartered in the village of Minova, where they just completed building the first coffee washing-station in Congo in over forty years. Additionally, this is the first coffee from DR Congo to acheive the top national grade - Kivu  - since .
Lake Kivu’s first sip springs forward with tones of fresh cherry, developing into notes of fresh-cut flowers, clementine, peach, and buttery pie crust. As the cup cools, the floral tones open up into earthy green tea acting as a nice foundation for the brighter, sweet fruit we see in the forefront. This coffee is very juicy, turning into a slightly dry effervescent mouth-feel in the finish which reminded us of Bottle Cap candies. It is the perfect coffee to greet the oncoming summer sunshine.
Orion was designed to produce a unique espresso blend accentuating the elegance of chocolate and the complex nature of sweet fruit. 
When we started planning our coffee program, we knew we wanted a strong, foundational house espresso; something complex enough to be enjoyed alone, and additionally have enough depth to hold up in milk. The combination of elements had to reflect something greater than their parts. Each character had to play its role to balance and accentuate the others. In unison, they create Orion: rich and silky in body, covering a range of chocolate tones with balancing notes of dark berries and citrus highlights. Although the elements occasionally change to reflect the seasonality of coffee harvests, these are the driving principles behind how we shape Orion.
Orion, our flagship espresso, bears a name loaded in history. Orion is a constellation on the celestial equator. It is so bright and recognizable in the sky that humans have been marveling at it since the beginning of time. The belt of Orion is aligned with major, unexplained monoliths, such as the Great Pyramids and Teotihuacan. In Mayan culture, Orion was believed to be the beginning point of all creation, and they built their metropolis in response to it. In Greek myths, Orion is a superhuman giant often represented with a bronze club and shield. Even some US history has references to Orion: The Hopi villages (in what is now Arizona) from AD mimic major stars of Orion like a map. Hopi beloved Orion was origin of their creator, Massaw. Ubiquitous in myth, Orion is the foundation for cities and culture.

By visiting the Site directly or through another site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and consent to the collection and use of information as discussed in this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not access this Site.
This Privacy Policy applies to the Site. This Privacy Policy does not necessarily apply to any offline collection of your personal information. Please see below for details.
We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices on any web site not operated by Water Avenue Coffee. to which the Site links or that links to the Site.
We collect information from you in several different ways on this Site. We may collect any content, record, or electronic communication of any kind, including without limitation your () contact information, () financial information, () demographic information, and () other personal information required to process your application to request services from us, so that we may provide you with the information or services that you request, and so that we may communicate with you and send you information and materials for marketing and other purposes, subject to applicable laws and the terms of the Privacy Policy.
One goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide an efficient, meaningful, and customized experience. For example, we can use your personal information to:
(a) Registration and Ordering. Before using certain parts of any Site or ordering products, you must complete an online registration form. During registration, you will be prompted to provide to us certain personal information, including but not limited to your name, shipping and billing address(es), phone number(s), email address, and credit card number.

If we encounter a problem when processing your order, your personal information may be used to contact you.
(b) Email Addresses. Several locations of the Site permit you to enter your email address for purposes including but not limited to: to register for a contest or sweepstakes; to request us to notify you of new products; to sign up for email newsletters and special offers. Your participation in a contest or sweepstakes is completely voluntary, so you have a choice whether to participate and disclose information to us. We use this information to notify contest and sweepstakes winners and to award prizes. By entering a contest or sweepstakes, you may be opting in to receive our email newsletter and special offers and this will be disclosed in the official rules governing the contest or sweepstakes.
(c) Cookies and Other Technology. Like many sites, the Site employs cookies and web beacons (also known as clear GIF technology or “action tags”) to speed your navigation of the Site, recognize you and your access privileges, and track your Site usage.
(i) Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored as text files by your Internet browser on your computer’s hard drive. Most Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from web sites or to remove cookies from your hard drive, but if you do, you will not be able to access or use portions of the Site. We have to use cookies to enable you to select products, place them in an online shopping cart, and to purchase those products. If you do this, we keep a record of your browsing activity and purchase. THE SITE’S COOKIES DO NOT AND CANNOT INFILTRATE A USER’S HARD DRIVE TO GATHER A USER’S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Our cookies are not “spyware.”
(ii) Web beacons assist in delivering cookies and help us determine whether a web page on the Site has been viewed and, if so, how many times. For example, any electronic image on the Site, such as an ad banner, can function as a web beacon.
(iii) We may use third-party advertising companies to help tailor site content to users or to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and web beacons to measure advertising effectiveness (such as which web pages are visited or what products are purchased and in what amount). Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any personal information collected by us.
(iv) As an example, Facebook collects certain information via cookies and web beacons to determine which web pages are visited or what products are purchased.

(An IP address may indicate the location of your computer on the Internet.)  IP addresses are not used to track a user’s session.  This information only helps us determine how often different areas of our Site are visited.  We do not link IP address to any information that is personally identifiable.
(a) Internal Use. We use your personal information to process your order and provide you with customer service. We may internally use your personal information to improve the Sites’ content and layout, to improve outreach and for our own marketing efforts (including marketing our services and products to you), and to determine general marketplace information about visitors to the Site.

Also, you may submit your email address for reasons such as to register for a contest or sweepstakes; to request us to notify you of products; to sign up for email newsletters and special offers. If you submit your email address, we use it to deliver the information to you. We always permit you to unsubscribe or opt out of future emails (see the opt out section, below, for more details). Because we have to communicate with you about orders that you choose to place, you cannot opt out of receiving emails related to your orders.
(c) External Use. We want to provide you with excellent service and to offer you a great selection. We do not sell, rent, trade, license or otherwise disclose your specific personal information or financial information to anyone other than to affiliates under Water Avenue Coffee’s control, except that:
(i) As do most Internet retailers, we sometimes use others to perform specific functions on our behalf. When we disclose information to these service providers, we disclose information to help them to perform their service. For example, in order to deliver products to you, we must share some information. We partner with third parties (such as the U.S. Postal Service and United Parcel Service to ship products, to ensure delivery, and so that we can obtain feedback, improve the quality of our service, and measure and improve the quality of the service of the third party. In the example of shippers, we provide them some personally identifiable information such as your name, shipping address, email, and phone number.

When we submit your credit card number for authorization, we use state-of-the-art data encryption to protect your information. (More on this below in Data Security.)
(iv) We may disclose such information in response to requests from law enforcement officials conducting investigations; subpoenas; a court order; or if we are otherwise required to disclose such information by law. We also will release personal information where disclosure is necessary to protect our legal rights, enforce our Terms of Service or other agreements, to operate the Site or to protect ourselves or others. For example, we may share information to reduce the risk of fraud or if someone uses or attempts to use the Site for illegal reasons or to commit fraud.
(v) We will not sell (or trade or rent) personally identifiable information to other companies as part of our regular course of business. However, it’s possible that we might acquire or merge with or be acquired by another company or that we might dispose of some or all of our assets. If that happens, your personal information may be disclosed to another company, but that disclosure will be subject to the Privacy Policy then in effect.
(vi) We may share non-personal information (such as the number of daily visitors to a particular web page, or the size of an order placed on a certain date) with third parties such as advertising partners. This information does not directly personally identify you or any user.
(vii) We may publicly disclose the name, city, and state of the contest and sweepstakes winners.
(viii) In addition, we may use and share aggregated information that does not uniquely identify you when it enables us to improve and enrich our services and the Site’s content.
We maintain full rights to any information collected on this website, and may freely collect, use and disclose such information unless prohibited by this Privacy Policy or applicable law.
The Site incorporates physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, including Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) for all financial transactions through the Site. We use SSL encryption to protect your personal information online, and we also take several steps to protect your personal information in our facilities. Access to your personal information is restricted. Only employees who need access to your personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to your personal information. Finally, we rely on third-party service providers for the physical security of some of our computer hardware. We believe that their security procedures are adequate. For example, when you visit the Site, you access servers that are kept in a secure physical environment, behind a locked cage and an electronic firewall.
While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information, we cannot guarantee complete security. % complete security does not presently exist anywhere online or offline.
Upon your request, we will (a) correct or update your personal information; (b) stop sending emails to your email address; and/or (c) disable your account to prevent any future purchases through that account. You can make these requests at the “contact us” section of the Site http://wateravenuecoffee.com/contact, or by telephoning, or emailing your request to Water Avenue Coffee’s Customer Service Team --- or:
Please do not email your credit-card number or other sensitive information.
If you wish to have access to your personal information in our records, please contact us with your request at info@wateravenuecoffee.com.  You may also request that we update your personal information or correct any factual errors that you believe may exist regarding this information.
As you might expect from us, the majority of information that we collect is obtained through the Site, and this Privacy Policy applies only to that online collection of personal information. We also may collect information offline, where we also try to protect the privacy of your personal information. One example involves someone calling us to place an order or to ask questions. When someone calls, we will ask only for the personal information we need in order to place the order or to answer the question. When we need to store information (such as order information), we will enter it into our database through SSL encryption. (See the Data Security section above for more information). Another example involves faxes. If you fax something to us, we will act upon the fax and then either store it a locked repository or we will shred the fax if there is no need to retain the information. There are other ways we could learn of personal information offline (for example, we suppose someone could send us a letter including some return address information), and this Policy doesn’t discuss or try to predict all of those methods or uses. As we mentioned, we will try to treat offline collection, uses, and disclosures consistently with our relevant online practices.

Sparkling and tart, nice sweetness with flavors of clover honey and chilled butter.
Long Miles Coffee Project is an operation in Burundi with two washing stations, Bukeye in the Muramvya province, and Heza in the Kayanza province. Both washing stations buy cherry from individual farmers and some coops, keeping the small communities’ coffee separate to track quality and trends. The washing station is an essential part of a Burundian coffee producer’s access to the market, and the specialty market especially. Long Miles goes beyond simply providing a platform for selling—they invest in extensive training with the famers on cherry selection, pruning, pest control and above all, they provide quality premiums to everyone at the end of harvest. Gaharo is the closest community to the Bukeye station in Muramvya, roughly  families farm mostly coffee and tea in this area, but also beans, sweet potato, cassava, bananas and taro.

Mellow with light floral and melon notes, and flavors of cranberry muffins and Prosecco.
Heza is the second washing station for Long Miles Coffee Project, in the Kayanza region of Burundi. Most of the coffees we offer from Burundi are fully washed, meaning all of the fruit from the cherry is removed from the seed before the drying process. Long Miles has been doing some experimentation here and there, so we decided to pick up this very limited, one bag lot of honey processed coffee. The honey process is somewhere in between fully washed and natural—where the skin of the cherry is removed but the mucilage is left on while the coffee dries.

Pleasant brightness with a sweet tomato finish with hints of mild toffee and vanilla.
El Meridiano is the name of this coffee from the "Asociacion de Productores de Cafe Especial del Alto Saldana" or ASOCEAS. This lot represents the highest quality day lots from about  growers in the Tolima region in west-central Colombia. Most of the growers have modestly sized farms and wet mill their coffee with small, sometimes hand cranked depulpers. Coffee is fermented with traditional methods and dried on rooftops or in small greenhouses. Because of the climate of this region and the proximity to the Equator, Tolima generally has two harvest seasons.

Complex tropical overtones and flavors of pineapple and melon with fresh papaya acidity—pungent but smooth and balanced. .
This is a particularly spectacular tiny lot from Nodier Andrade. We’ve been buying a variety of coffee from him throughout the season, pulling out these exceptional day lots to feature. His farm, El Mandarino, is high up in the mountains of Huila at  meters. The combination of favorable climate, great varieties like Typica and Caturra and his approach to farm renovation and care of processing make this Colombian coffee like none we’ve ever offered. Wild brightness and sweet tomato notes can make this coffee mistakable for a Kenya on the cupping table.

Very balanced with chocolate milk notes and light berry juice overtones.
Finca Quizzara is the farm of Carole Zbinden, and Jardin de Aromas is her micro mill that processes all the coffee from the farm. Carole is extremely particular and organized--the farm is mapped out into small lots and each lot is picked, processed and kept separate. As each day lot is finished, they are cupped and the scores are recorded. She keeps a record of how everything has cupped to identify patterns and really understand the entire farm.
Hand labor represents about % of the production cost for coffee. Like many of the coffee pickers in Costa Rica, much of the labor are migrant workers from Nicaragua. About - pickers work at Jardin de Aromas from the middle of October through February. The same pickers come back every year, and Carole provides housing for them and their families.
The farm is about  hectares, which is spread over  separated lots. At any given time, about / of the farm is not in production due to major pruning, which stimulates new growth and benefits the health of the shrub and cup quality. Each day, the mill depulpes the equivalent of about  bags of green coffee. Carole runs the pulper slower than what is typical, since she has found the equipment is able to remove any green cherries that snuck in a little better at slower speeds. The coffee is first dried on the patio, and then finished in the mechanical dryer, which is closely monitored for temperature consistency, and the coffee is rested at night (simulating what the sun would naturally do.) The dryer is powered by parchment (she has her own small dry mill) which is the outer shell of the coffee that is removed in the final step of processing, as well as the pruned branches from the farm. It's clear that the attention to detail she applies to each step of the process is reflected in the cup.

This coffee has warm flavors of cinnamon, almond butter and caramel with a long finish and full body.
Decaf coffee is a whole different animal, so we take extra care in roasting this coffee. The Swiss Water Process is a way of removing the caffeine from coffee without the use of chemicals; we feel that the process helps maintain some of the original flavors of the coffee and gives us more to work with in the roaster. Over the past year, we’ve been focusing on bringing in better tasting decafs by choosing origins we love and using higher quality coffees to put through the decaffeination process. This particular batch turned out super, it comes from the Guji region in the south where many of our tastiest Ethiopian coffees are grown.

Retinas burn and weak palates crumble when they see Neon coming.  Staying true to our roots, this espresso blend is bright and glows with sweetness.  In fact, we recommend wearing BluBlockers while extracting. The body of this blend is like syrup and the candy-coated finish lingers like a Minnesota goodbye. We're working hard on our end to create something crazy delicious, and now it's in your hands--a bit of patience and some effort will make this espresso explode with flavor and complexity.  Enjoy.

This cold brew takes its name from the famous Zamboni ice resurfacer. The Zamboni Company has a history of innovation in keeping cold things smooth. The family started in refrigeration over  years ago and as the popularity of ice skating rose, Frank Zamboni shared his ice-related talent by building the Iceland skating rink in southern California in ; later, he introduced the world's first ice resurfacing machine. Through Frank's persistence and commitment to the industry, Zamboni has become famous all over the world.  We hope that this cold brew can achieve some of the same goals. We want you to enjoy something that tastes smooth and delicious, and cools you down fast. This blend is specifically sourced and roasted for the cold brew method. The base is a natural processed Brazil—giving it a chocolate-toffee base, while the Ethiopian component gives it a higher noted, wild, fruity element.
To brew this coffee the way we think you should ;) you'll need to use one whole bag (oz) to  cups of water. Use a coarse grind (like for a french press) and steep in cold water in the fridge for - hours. Drain the brew and cut with % cold filtered water. 
Add on one of our cold brew retail bottles to store (some of) your brewed cold brew! We can't send you our brewed concentrate, but you could use this bottle and pretend like we did. Bottle also works great for using as a vase for a few flowers, storing homemade ginger beer or kombucha, or shampoo.

There are many different ways to brew with the Aeropress®, which is one of the reasons we’re such big fans! This virtually unbreakable brewer is also a great travel companion because of its durability, brewing forgiveness and quick cleanup.
We’re giving you two sets of instructions here for a single and double cup Aeropress. The first set of instructions are precise and measured, while the second set is more relaxed and doesn’t require a scale or exact measurements for when you’re off the grid.
To create one  oz cup of a delicious brew that doesn’t need to be diluted, use  grams of coffee and  grams of water. If you don’t have a scale handy, use one leveled scoop (the one that comes with the Aeropress) of whole bean coffee and pour the water until it reaches the middle of the # mark to get a similar ratio.
If you’d like to brew coffee for two or more volume for yourself in a single Aeropress you absolutely can—that’s part of the magic! Use - grams of coffee and fill it with water to the # mark. When you plunge, you’ll get a delicious coffee concentrate. Dilute the concentrate by adding hot, filtered water from your kettle. Use the coffee to water ratio you prefer and keep track of how much water you used for brewing. Add the remainder of the water to the finished concentrate, we recommend a /-/ ratio of coffee to water. For example, to brew a / ratio, use g of coffee,  grams of water. Around  grams of water will fit in the brewer for the extraction and the remaining  grams of water would be added to the finished concentrate. You can also totally eyeball it and add filtered water to taste. No matter how much coffee you are brewing in the Aeropress, as long as you have an accurate grind size, the pressure aspect of the brewer will extract the coffee well with varying coffee to water ratios. 
The grind size should be fine—think beach sand that still has a little grit to it when rubbed between your fingers. You’ll know your grind size is close based on how long it takes to plunge the coffee. If the grind is too coarse, the plunge will be too quick. If the grind is too fine, it will take a long time and be difficult to push.
** Use a burr grinder! Consistent grind size is one of the most important components to an even extraction and is most easily achieved with a burr grinder. A spice mill style blade grinder will not only give you a variety of particle sizes leading to uneven extraction, it will also be impossible to replicate the grind from brew to brew. Check out the Hario Slim for an affordable option that's great for travel (and an arm workout!)
) Boil your filtered water in a kettle (or a pan over a campfire!) The ideal water temperature for brewing coffee is between -F. Since we will be rinsing the filter first, there will be just the right amount of time for the water to cool down to the desired temperature.
) While you’re waiting for the water to boil, weigh out  grams of coffee and grind it in your burr grinder.
) Remove the filter holder from your Aeropress (the black cap thing with holes in it), place the little circle filter inside and screw it on the brewer. Set this part of the brewer on a mug, filter end down.
) When the water boils, remove it from the heat and use it to rinse the filter and heat up your brewer. Fill the brewer about half full and let it completely drain into your mug. Discard the rinse water. (Don’t forget! Brewing coffee into your rinse water is the saddest.)
) Place the mug with the brewer on top on your scale. Add the ground coffee and tare. The Aeropress comes with a funnel to help navigate the coffee into the brewer successfully. Get your timer ready.
) Start the timer and pour the water onto the coffee quickly until your scale reads  grams. Give the slurry a quick stir, being careful not to scrape the filter. Insert the plunger of the Aeropress, working it into place just slightly into the brewer. Pull up a little to create a vacuum seal. A little coffee will probably have dripped through the filter into your mug, which is nothing to worry about!
) After one minute, apply firm, even pressure to the plunger until you hear a hissing sound. The plunge should take - seconds. If it’s very difficult to push or it takes longer, try coarsening the grind. If it’s very easy to push and takes less than  seconds, you’ll want to fine the grind.
) Your coffee is done! Remove the Aeropress from the mug, twist off the filter cap and use the plunger to shoot the puck of coffee out into the trash/compost/garden.
To make an Aeropress for two, follow the same instructions with these changes:
Follow steps -, Use  grams of coffee. You will need a slightly finer grind size for a  cup Aeropress, so it will still feel sand-like, but with a little less grit.
) The water you add to brew should be approximately  grams. This will reach the top of the # mark on the Aeropress and be very full. Give the coffee-water slurry several careful stirs back and forth, being careful not to scrape the filter. You want to ensure there are no dry clump of coffee grounds, so  solid stirs in both directions is great. At the -minute mark, give one more stir and insert the plunger carefully, working it into place just slightly into the brewer. Pull up a little to create a seal.
) When the timer says :, apply firm, even pressure to the plunger until you hear a hissing sound. The plunge should take between - seconds. If it’s very hard to push or it takes too long, coarsen the grind. If it’s very easy to push and takes less than  seconds, fine the grind. Be very careful when you push, there is a lot of coffee in there so it will be a slow and steady process.
) Pour the concentrate you’ve created equally into two mugs, and then dilute with water to taste. We recommend  grams of additional water poured into the total concentrate. Enjoy!

Start with a kosher sea salt-ish grind, and coarsen the grind size the more coffee you’re brewing. It might seem coarser than it should be, especially if you’re brewing a fairly large Chemex, but this is normal! This is where timing your brew really helps! If your coffee brewed too fast, then fining up the grind size is the answer. If your coffee brewed painfully slow, then a slight coarsening of the grind will fix that right up. Make small adjustments to start, and test the results.
If your coffee brews too fast, you’ll probably also experience a thin/watery body, and light, underwhelming, slightly sour flavors. If your coffee brews too slow you’ll experience an increase in the body, but probably some extra bitterness, especially in the aftertaste.
Once you get close to the correct timing, your coffee should be pretty tasty!
** Use a burr grinder! Consistent grind size is one of the most important components to an even extraction and is most easily achieved with a burr grinder. A spice mill style blade grinder will not only give you a variety of particle sizes leading to uneven extraction, it will also be impossible to replicate the grind from brew to brew. Check out the Hario Slim for an affordable option that's great for travel (and an arm workout!)
) Boil your filtered water in your swan neck kettle. The ideal water temperature for coffee brewing is between -F, but since we will be rinsing the filter with boiling water first, there will be just the right amount of time for it to cool down to the proper temperature.
) While you’re waiting for the water to boil, weigh out your coffee and grind it in your burr grinder. Set aside.
) Get your filter ready. Open the Chemex filter keeping one layer to one side and three layers to the other. Place the thicker side on the spout side. This will ensure that air can move out of the base of the chemex through the spout, allowing liquid to move in.
) Now that your water is boiling, remove it from the stove and use it to rinse your paper filter. Rinsing the filter will remove any papery taste, as well as heat up your Chemex. Dump the rinse water out without removing the filter. *Pro Tip: Pour the water out on the opposite side of the spout, the filter will stay in place and the water will leave the chemex quicker because air is allowed in through the spout channel.
) Place your Chemex on the scale, add the ground coffee and tare your scale to zero. Shake it a little to get a nice flat bed of coffee. Get your timer ready.
) Start your timer. Pour water slowly onto the coffee until there are no more dry grounds. You’ll want to use double the weight of water to the dose of coffee. (ie: if you’re brewing g of coffee, use around g of water). You should see the coffee puff up, this is known as the “bloom”. If you don’t see any gas bubbles or any puffing up, it probably means your coffee is on the older side and it has already degassed. Your coffee will be tastiest when it still contains gas, and is nice and lively.
) After  seconds- minute (less time for less coffee, more time for more coffee), start pouring slowly to rehydrate the coffee bed. Then pour the rest of the water in a slow, continuous stream in the center of the coffee bed until you have reached the water weight ratio you’re aiming for. You can pour in a circular motion if you’d like, just make sure to focus the pour in the center of the Chemex where most of the coffee is to avoid overextracting particles on the sides. Never pour on the side of the Chemex! It’s ok if you have to pause your pour a couple times so the Chemex doesn’t overflow, just don’t let the coffee bed drain too much in between pulses. An ideal water flow is slow, but constant.
) When the brewing coffee goes from a steady stream, to drips, your coffee is done! Remove the filter and compost. Give the coffee a little swirl inside the Chemex, and pour it into your favorite mug. Close your eyes, sip, and enter flavor country.

These brewers are Dogwood Coffee’s official favorite no fuss no muss brew method!
You’ll need a few things to achieve maximum tastiness:
To make a oz mug of coffee, you’ll need g of coffee and between -g of water, depending how strong you like your brew. If you’re pouring with a swan-neck kettle very slowly, the coffee will take between :-: minutes total to brew. If you’re pouring more quickly with a tea-style kettle it will take longer, maybe - minutes.
For a oz coffee, you’ll want to use g of coffee and g of water. Contrary to instructions below, DO NOT fold the bottom filter seam when brewing this much coffee. When the filter is folded it sits below the rim of the dripper and you run the risk of overflow or floating grounds in your delicious coffee. If you pour with a swan-neck kettle very slowly, the coffee will take between :-: minutes total to brew. If you pour more quickly with a tea-style kettle it will take longer, maybe - minutes.
Start with a grind size a tiny bit coarser than regular table salt and coarsen the grind size if you increase the amount of coffee you will be brewing. This is where timing your brew really helps because it will help you know if your grind size is accurate! If your coffee brews too fast, fining up the grind size is the answer. If your coffee brews painfully slow, a slight coarsening of the grind will fix that right up. Make small adjustments to start, and test the results.
Coffee that brews too fast will result in a thin/watery body and light, underwhelming, slightly sour flavors. Coffee that brews too slowly will have a heavier body, but probably some extra bitterness, especially in the aftertaste.
Once you get close to the correct timing, your coffee will be pretty tasty!
** Use a burr grinder! Consistent grind size is one of the most important components to an even extraction and is most easily achieved with a burr grinder. A spice mill style blade grinder will not only give you a variety of particle sizes leading to uneven extraction, it will also be impossible to replicate the grind from brew to brew. Check out the Hario Slim for an affordable option that's great for travel (and an arm workout!)
) Boil the filtered water in your kettle. The ideal water temperature for coffee brewing is between -F, but since we will be rinsing the filter first there will be just the right amount of time for it to cool down to the proper temperature.
) While you’re waiting for the water to boil, weigh out your coffee and grind it in your burr grinder.
) Get your filter ready. Fold the filter along the ridged edges (this will make it fit more snugly) and place in your brewer. *Remember! If brewing a oz size DO NOT fold the bottom crease! You’ll be maxing out the brewer’s capacity and risking overflow.
) Use the boiling water to rinse your paper filter; this will remove any papery taste as well as heat up your brewer. Drain the water out of the bottom of the brewer by either holding it over the sink, or by draining it into your coffee mug. (Remember to dump this water out of your mug!)
) Place your brewer on the scale, add the ground coffee and tare your scale to zero. Shake the brewer a little to get a nice flat bed of coffee. Get your timer ready.
) Start your timer. Pour the water onto the coffee nice and slow in the center until there are no more dry grounds or clumps, and you have reached -g of water. If you’re using a swan-neck kettle, this pour should take you about  seconds for a oz and  minute for a oz. If you’re using a tea-style kettle, pour as slow as you can until you reach the desired water ratio (trying to mimic the time you would use with the swan neck kettle.) The faster the water is poured, the longer the coffee will take to drain. Let your coffee hang out until your timer says :.
) At :, carefully lift the brewer and place on top of your mug. If using a Clever Coffee Dripper, it will begin to drain automatically. (This is why knowing your mug size is important—you don’t want a surprise overflow!). If using a Bonavita, you will need to physically flip the lever at the bottom from OFF to ON which will allow the brewer to drain. The coffee will brew another - minutes as it drains, landing at the ideal total brew time.
If your coffee drains too fast or too slow, a slight grind adjustment will fix the problem. These brewers have a fairly wide range of acceptable brew time and grind size, and that’s what we love about them! Do a little experimenting and you’ll discover your favorite way of brewing delicious coffee in these magical devices.
) Remove the brewer from the mug, compost your filter and enjoy your delicious coffee!

A brewing device that's bound to make you swoon! Kalita® offers us a stainless steel dripper that - like porcelain or glass - still maintains heat, is large enough to brew  mugs of coffee (oz), and it's flat bottom design encourages even extraction.
You’ll need a few things to achieve maximum tastiness:
We use the Kalita Wave to brew a single cup of coffee. Our favorite ratio is  grams of coffee, to  grams of water. The total brew time should be about :.
Start with a kosher salt-ish grind. If you are brewing more then  grams of coffee, coarsen the grind slightly, and make sure you’re brewing into a larger mug or coffee server, and the brew time should be just slightly longer. We use a coffee to water ratio of :-:.
This is where timing your brew really helps! If the coffee brews too fast, you’ll probably also experience a thin/watery body, and light, underwhelming, slightly sour flavors. Fine the grind to slow down the brew process. If the coffee brews painfully slow, you’ll experience an increase in the body but probably some extra bitterness, especially in the aftertaste. A slight coarsening of the grind will help speed up the brew. Make small adjustments to start, and test the results.
Once you get close to the correct timing, your coffee should be pretty tasty!
** Use a burr grinder! Consistent grind size is one of the most important components to an even extraction and is most easily achieved with a burr grinder. A spice mill style blade grinder will not only give you a variety of particle sizes leading to uneven extraction, it will also be impossible to replicate the grind from brew to brew. Check out the Hario Slim for an affordable option that's great for travel (and an arm workout!)
) Boil filtered water in the swan neck kettle. The ideal water temperature for coffee brewing is between -ºF, but since you will be rinsing the filter with boiling water first, there will be just the right amount of time for it to cool down to the proper temperature.
) While you’re waiting for the water to boil, weigh the coffee and grind it in a burr grinder.
) Place the filter inside the brewer and place on your favorite mug, mason jar, or fancy coffee server.
) When the water is boiling, remove it from the stove and use it to rinse your paper filter. Rapidly pour the water directly into the center of your filter, avoiding the sides. The shape of the Kalita Wave filter is one of the reasons it extracts so evenly, so any folding would be a huge bummer. Once most of the filter is wet it will be safe to pour along the top edges to finish the rinse. Rinsing the filter will remove any papery taste and heat up the brewer. Pour enough water so that the brewer feels warm. Lift the brewer and dump the rinse water.
) Place the Kalita Wave and mug on the scale, add the ground coffee and tare. Shake the brewer a little to get a nice flat bed of coffee.
) Start the timer. Pour - grams of water slowly onto the coffee until there are no more dry grounds. You should see the coffee puff up, this is known as the “bloom”. If you don’t see any gas bubbles or any puffing up, it probably means your coffee is on the older side as has already degassed.
) After  seconds, start pouring at a quick, even pace, in a clockwise motion, until your scale reads  grams. This pour should take about  seconds. Let the water level drain slightly. At : add another - grams of water, bringing the water level back to the original height. Do the same at : and again at : (bringing the weight to around ). At :, slowly pour along the top edge of the coffee rim on the filter, washing those “high and dry” grounds into the coffee bed until you reach  grams.
) When the brewing coffee slows to drips every few seconds, your coffee is done! Total brew time should be around :. If the brew ends sooner, or takes a little longer, that’s ok! Each coffee is unique, and the age of the coffee can affect the brew time as well, so sometimes these numbers aren’t % consistent. Give it a taste! If the coffee has a bitter aftertaste, try coarsening the grind just a touch. If the coffee brewed a little too quickly and tastes weak, fine the grind.
) Lift the brewer off your mug, remove the filter and compost. Now you can enjoy your delicious coffee!

Roasting is the mark we put on the coffees we source, we translate the work of the coffee producer into the nearly finished product. The roast is a hugely transformative part of coffee’s path from seed to cup. Through heat, time and intuition, we transition the coffee from an ultra dense, bitter and fibrous state to a form we can grind, brew and enjoy.
We aim to roast in such a way that brings out our favorite flavors in each particular coffee. We never push our presence with roast flavor, but we have well developed coffees that are deliciously drinkable. No two coffees are the same; even from year to year the crop from the same farm changes. Roasting requires attention to detail and responsiveness to the changing coffee and environment. With every roast, every day, we taste and adjust and learn more about the coffees and the craft of coffee roasting.
At its core, roasting coffee is a craft and a science. In the real world, it’s a production job that requires responsiveness to an ever-changing product and a skill for repeatability and consistency. There is so much scooping and lifting and heat and noise and sniffing and frustration and satisfaction. We try to maintain a consistent product while being able to explore the possibilities of each coffee, and we do it every day so that the coffee we’re putting out in the world is as fresh as can be! 
We try super hard. Please just like us. :)

Sourcing at Dogwood Coffee is based on three principles: Quality, reciprocal relationships and balance. Through communication, travel and the cupping table, we find delicious coffees and awesome people to work with that mirror our philosophies about coffee and life in general.
Quality is the driving factor behind what we do and provides expandable opportunities from the coffee farm to the brewed cup. In coffee, working for quality means access to sustainable markets and satisfaction with the work. There is little point in doing something without the drive to do it well, and in the end, we’re all interested in drinking tasty coffee.
Relationships are fundamental to our sourcing approach. We partner with producers, exporters, importers and other sourcing pros that allow us to participate in the process and forge meaningful, longstanding relationships. We travel to the countries where coffee grows to know the places and people, and to push the process of discovery. We are not afraid to cultivate new relationships with producers who have been where we have before—trying to figure it out and do something new. Through building relationships we share in the risk of discovery and in the awesomeness of success.
Balance runs through everything for us. Our offerings are balanced yet interesting—with wild coffees that knock your socks off and coffees you could drink all day. Balance means that we step back and try to understand what we do in a global perspective. Coffee is the livelihood of and hugely important to millions of people spanning culture and economics, but we remember that people have lives and that what happens around coffee is of equal significance.
It is humbling to follow the process of coffee: a fruit that gets picked by hand on the other side of the world, pulped and dried, sorted and stored and sold, then put on trucks and boats to get to us. All along there are hundreds of ways something could go wrong, hundreds of factors that contribute to a delicious cup and hundreds of people intertwined. Quality, relationship and balance are on our minds as we buy coffees that help make us the company we are.

In the small colony of Collasuyo in Caranavi region Nicolas Calque and his wife Maruja are doing a careful job at their process station. They have a farm called “ La Florida”  in Collasuyo of  hectares where they produce and process their coffee. Nicolas started in coffee industry  years ago. His neighbors recognize him as a coffee lover and at the age of  Nicolas went to live with grandmother  as his family were having economical problems. He started working as coffee picker, whilst his grandmother provided food and shelter. In  Nicolas invested all his savings and bought a farm in the colony of Collasuyo where he dedicated his entire farm to produce coffee, but the prices they were receiving for their product were too low to cover the family costs. In  Nicolas and his wife sold their farm and moved to Brazil to improve their quality of life. However, they soon changed their mind, ”It was not what I expected, I worked over  hour in a sewing plant, we lived with  families locked in a room in poor conditions.”  says Nicolas. Six months later Nicolas returned home to Collasuyo with his family and bought back the coffee farm in the farm from his savings. This has motivated Nicolas to produce more and tastier coffee. He’s a part of the program that Daniela and Pedro has, called Sol de Manana.

”Working together with the exporters Daniella and Pedro we are supporting their program Sol de Mañana which is educating the farmers in treatments for leaf-rust and how a higher price can be achieve for higher quality. Villa Tunari is a colony in Caranarvi that have just started working in the project.” /Joanna Alm, Head roaster, Drop Coffee
Elda is a young women who together with her husband Felix Choquehuanca source beautiful cherries from the colony of Taypiplaya. During the day they both tend the land, pruning, clearing and picking the cherries.  
At the end of the day both Elda and Felix hand sort the cherries for unripes and defects, knowing this will help them be selected as a micro lot. Then by Taxi they deliver their cherries to the Buena Vista mill Every night from  pm to  am where the coffee is processed.  If selected as a micro lot it is separated and then cupped at the mill to access its quality. Being selected means a higher price for the cherry, and can then go on to be a lot like this one.
They are now a part of the program that Daniela and Pedro has, called Sol de Manana. Pedro and Daniela are exporting the coffee and finding a good market for it, they are also training the farmers to work for a higher quality with less leaf-rust.

”Working together with Daniella and Pedro we are supporting their program Sol de Mañana, the program is educating the farmers in treatments  and knowledge for leaf rust and general coffee husbandry . This coffee is from Daniella and Pedro's own farm that they have invested in, to show the other growers what they can achieve in quality and simply how to get a higher price for a higher quality.  Growing a coffee like Longberry truly shows how complex and lively a Bolivian coffee can be.” /Joanna Alm, Head roaster 
Caranavi, located   kilometres north of La Paz city, it has been noted as the centre of Bolivian coffee production. With the super rich soil combined with high altitudes, it has become the epicentre for coffee production in  Bolivia. 
Given the regions potential to produce unique exotic flavours it really is a hotbed for amazing coffee. Despite it’ s international recognition, Caranavi has neglected its coffee production. A mixture of ageing coffee plantations, reducing yields and leaf rust, combined with a high pressure towards coca cultivation has meant the coffee has been in decline. With coca being  times more profitable and with less growing issues, it has meant many producers have abandoned coffee production in favour of this lucrative crop.  
To try to save specialty coffee in Caranavi, our exporters Daniela and Pedro Roudriguez have started the project Sol de Manana. They have been sourcing coffee from small coffee producers in the region for three decades. However this steady decline of coffee production has not only put at risk the sustainability of there export business, but the future of coffee production in Bolivia is at risk of disappearing forever.  
They assumed the challenge of boosting the production and support the Bolivian coffee growing by the planting of new coffee plantations under a sustainable model based in three pillars.
Economical, Social and Environmental; Sol de Manana. In this project La Linda was the very first and perhaps most important farm. Besides Caturra and Typica,  they are here growing new exotic varieties to plant in its farms and implement new processes post-harvest. This one is a very unique example of them being the Longberry varietal. This one amazed us with a white sugary like sweetness, elegance and floral notes. This coffee is one of the four coffees we’re buying from Daniella and Pedro this year. This being the smaller lot we only have  kilo’s, a true nano lot.

Three packs of our amazing Bolivian coffees for you to try the diverse taste profiles of this special region  
In the small colony of Collasuyo in Caranavi region Nicolas Calque and his wife Maruja are doing a careful job at their process station. They have a farm called “ La Florida”  in Collasuyo of  hectares where they produce and process their coffee. Nicolas started in coffee industry  years ago. His neighbors recognize him as a coffee lover and at the age of  Nicolas went to live with grandmother  as his family were having economical problems. He started working as coffee picker, whilst his grandmother provided food and shelter. In  Nicolas invested all his savings and bought a farm in the colony of Collasuyo where he dedicated his entire farm to produce coffee, but the prices they were receiving for their product were too low to cover the family costs. In  Nicolas and his wife sold their farm and moved to Brazil to improve their quality of life. However, they soon changed their mind, ”It was not what I expected, I worked over  hour in a sewing plant, we lived with  families locked in a room in poor conditions.”  says Nicolas. Six months later Nicolas returned home to Collasuyo with his family and bought back the coffee farm in the farm from his savings. This has motivated Nicolas to produce more and tastier coffee. He’s a part of the program that Daniela and Pedro has, called Sol de Manana. Pedro and Daniela are exporting the coffee and finding a good market for it, they are also training the farmers to work for a higher quality with less leaf rust. This year Nicolas has planted two more hectares of coffee.

Put your aeropress and cup on a scale. Bring filtered water to a boil. Thoroughly rinse paper filter to get rid of paper flavor.
Weigh out  grams of whole bean coffee. Grind the coffee a bit finer than filter drip (or use a grind that suits best for flavor and extraction).
Pull water off of the boil, and wait  seconds to a minute, or until the water is - degrees Fahrenheit. Start your timer, and quickly pour the water into the aeropress until it reaches  grams of water (near the top). Stir coffee.
Place plunger in just enough to seal the top, and keep coffee from dripping through.
 At  seconds, remove the plunger, and stir for five seconds. Place the plunger back on the aeropress to keep coffee from dripping through.
At  minute  seconds, remove plunger and stir for  seconds. Place the plunger and slowly push down for  seconds, until you hear a hissing sound. There should be moderate resistance. If it's very difficult to push down, your grind is too fine, if it's very easy, your grind is too coarse.
Make sure your coffee maker is clean and free of residue build up. Weigh out your coffee. A good ratio to start would be  grams (. ounces) of coffee to  liter (. ounces) of water.
For now enjoy this how to make espresso video!
A: We ship online orders Monday through Friday. If a major U.S. holiday falls on one of those days you can expect your coffee to go out the next available shipping day. The cut off time for getting your order in to ship the FOLLOWING day is pm. Examples: if you get your order in before pm on Monday, your package will ship on Tuesday; if you get your order in after pm on Thursday, your order will not ship until the following Monday. Note: Coffee Subscriptions only ship on Tuesday or Friday of each week. 
A: This depends on where you are and how fast you need your coffee. USPS Priority mail takes about - days to get anywhere in the U.S. however, their delivery times are not guaranteed and they do not deliver on Sunday. If choosing a FedEx option like express or  day shipping, keep in mind that these are business days and the weekends don’t count. For example, if you choose FedEx  day shipping and your package goes out Friday, your package will not arrive until the following Tuesday. Please see the color coded map below for FedEx Ground time in transit.
A: First, check your tracking number that gets emailed to you upon shipping! If you chose to ship USPS and the tracking states that the package has been delivered, call your local post office. They can tell you what happened, often they have it there waiting to be claimed. If nobody claims the package, it sits at the warehouse, and we do not hear about it until it ships back to us  days later. If you chose to ship FedEx, check your tracking number and read the progress of the transit time. When there are severe weather warnings, shipping is often delayed. If this is the case, FedEx does not reimburse shipping costs, therefore, heart doesn’t reimburse for severe weather delays. If you live on the east coast and ship FedEx Ground, keep in mind that your package will take - business days to reach you… this means - days including the weekend. It is very important that you are proactive with missing or delayed packages. Once the package has left the facility, it is out of our hands. Please make sure your address is correct, there aren’t any weather delays, and that you select the fastest shipping option that works best for you! 
A: We offer free shipping on orders of $ or more within the United States.
A: We can ship coffee anywhere, but keep in mind that it is rather expensive to ship internationally. The recipient is responsible for paying all brokerage, duties, and taxes associated with international shipping.
A: All packages are insured within the United States through USPS and FedEx. If your coffee is damaged upon arrival, we can ship you a new bag, no problem. Packages are only insured if they never show up, or the contents are damaged. Unfortunately it does not cover perishable items like coffee, and as long as it shows up (even if it takes a month) we cannot reimburse you. 
A: For merchandise, apparel, and/or brew equipment purchases: If merchandise, apparel, and/or brew equipment is broken or defective upon arrival, you may return or exchange the product within  days from purchase. If you want to make a return on merchandise, apparel, and/or brew equipment that is not broken or defective, the product must be unused, in its' original packaging and within  days from purchase. If we receive the product and it appears to be used you will not be refunded. Heart does not cover the return shipping cost for the product. For international packages, we are willing to replace merchandise damaged in transit. However, we would need the damaged goods returned and unfortunately we can not cover the shipping costs. Please contact coffee@heartroasters and a heart representative will get back to you with further information.
For coffee purchases: We cannot guarantee refunds on coffee purchases. If you have purchased coffee beans from heart and are not satisfied or if you have purchased a coffee subscription and wish to cancel the remainder due to dissatisfaction, please email coffee@heartroasters.com and a heart representative will get back to you with further information.

"Intelligentsia is our friend. They encompass many of the same poignant attributes as we do; with a focus on quality products, services, and experiences. Intellis reputation is what brought us to them by the recommendation of a good friend who said he would travel  plus miles for a cup of Intelligentsia coffee. From the get go our relationship with Intelli has been easy and positive, exemplified by their training, advice, fast service, and direct communication via an awesome rep.
Holding ourselves to high standards and dedication to Third Wave coffee has been extremely rewarding, this coupled with Intelligentsias high quality beans has earned us many consumer votes for best coffee in Minneapolis."

The Black Cat Project™ is the pursuit of espresso perfection in all of its manifestations. The project is rooted in our belief that espresso is simply a technique of brewing coffee, and that only the best coffees can make the best espressos. We want to push the boundaries of flavor, extending far beyond existing paradigms and preconceptions. We want you to experience single origin, micro-lot, and seasonal espressos with remarkably distinct flavor profiles. We want you to join us in a journey that begins with thoughtful cultivation, discerning sourcing, artisanal roasting, methodical research and development, and ends with nothing short of complete satisfaction.
We are committed to developing the tools for the craft of the barista, from those that are an extension of their hands, to competition-honed training, to machines they will revere, to the perfect vessels for all things espresso. Ultimately, we hope to bring all of these disparate pieces together and leave you with the beautiful simplicity and complexity you’ll find on the other side of a great shot of espresso.

Coffee comes from some of the most remote places in the world, and there are a number of key environmental preconditions that allow for the creation of incredible coffees: Altitude, diurnal temperature range, adequate sun exposure, good rainfall, and healthy soil are all critical factors that make great coffee possible. Follow the equator around the globe, look for places with elevations between - meters above sea level, and you will find the areas where top quality can be developed.
But having the right environmental conditions is only one piece of the puzzle. Most of the coffee grown in the world does not come close to achieving its real taste potential due to a severe lack of resources to finance quality operations, insufficient technical knowledge at the farm level, and infrastructure obstacles that cause major quality loss between harvest and shipment.
The only way to get truly exceptional coffees on a consistent basis is to work closely with farmers and millers in producing countries to help them overcome the hurdles that have held them back in the past. Our buyers and quality assurance team spend many months on the road each harvest season, working directly with growers to establish better protocols on their farms. It is an incredible experience to witness the transformation that can take place when a farmer learns to become an artisan rather than simply a harvester. Quality goes up tremendously, allowing growers to escape the commodity market and sell coffees that have real value based on their intrinsic merit.
Every country is politically, economically, and culturally different. Personal engagement with local farmers in each country is absolutely necessary. There is no single magic formula for producing brilliant coffees. Each location is a unique environment and has its own particular micro-climate, cultivating traditions, and infrastructures. We make several trips each season to every producing country where we work so that we can advise farmers and monitor quality from harvest to export. Over the years, we’ve formed meaningful relationships with growers in about twenty countries and will continue to develop coffees with them for many years to come. It is the ultimate study in mutual advantage—better coffees for consumers, better prices for growers. We consider it an honor and a privilege to be the catalyst that allows this dynamic to exist.
Our Direct Trade buying model set the new standards in the industry. It is the result of many years of experience working at source and navigating the ups and downs that are inherent in agriculture and developing countries. The premise is simple: Engage producers in the quality process, control quality from tree to port, make it all transparent, and pay prices that reward outstanding results. But the actual work is anything but simple. There is a seemingly endless list of variables with which to wrestle. The odds are stacked against success, a result of decades of corruption and chaos in the local industries and a historically merciless marketplace that robbed farmers of the opportunity to be active participants in their own destinies. Since coffee is among the top export earners for most producing countries, it is no surprise that the coffee trade is extremely politicized.
To cut through all the uncertainty, we’ve created systems that allow producers access to the same information as the millers and exporters. Our transparency contract is an important tool that defines and documents costs and profit across the chain of custody. A tiered pricing system establishes a very sustainable base price and ensures there is a clear, tangible link between cup quality and coffee value. Together their use empowers individual producers to control the outcome of their work in a way that was not available to them before. When the possibilities are well understood, well defined and reliable, producers can make real progress in advancing their incomes and making coffee farming a truly attractive profession. And the better news? Most producers we’ve met really want to improve upon what they are doing. They’ve never had the proper resources and had never been guaranteed substantial premiums for producing higher quality coffees.
When we talk about relationships, we really mean it. Not just an occasional phone conversation or a handshake or a postcard on the odd holiday. It is important to develop mutual trust and to create a sense of actual partnership where one person’s success supports the others. Since top coffee quality is such a delicate and fragile thing to produce, we must relentlessly commit to guarding and encouraging it. We typically spend time at each origin before, during, and after harvest in order to impact results and to anticipate hurdles rather than react to them. Ultimately, it is the farmer’s job to take care of his or her coffees, but we need to take an active role in helping them succeed. This means regular communication, feedback, advice, pre-financing, and training. It means being an integral part of the process.
When it all comes together, it leads to coffees that defy expectations and positively rewrite the definition of specialty coffee.
Coffee is such an incredibly dynamic and complicated beverage that attaining excellence on a consistent basis requires constant attention to detail and relentless quality control. Roasted coffee contains over  organic compounds that can contribute to flavor! More than wine, more than beer, more than Scotch. It is perhaps the most chemically complex beverage in existence, and to understand and control it, one must be committed to ongoing evaluation and study.
For this reason we devote a massive amount of resources to quality control. We maintain a staff that is dedicated specifically to quality investigation and analysis. Our baristas also act as satellite QC agents, tasting and communicating with our QC staff on a regular basis.
The method we employ most often to study and understand our coffees is known as cupping. This standardized protocol was developed by the coffee industry to allow for consistent evaluation of coffees in an environment where the variables that can affect coffee flavor are controlled to the greatest possible degree. Following these guidelines, we use a consistent water temperature of  degrees C and consistent grind and weights with every cup measured individually to within half a gram. Over the course of  minutes, each coffee is evaluated on the basis of fragrance (dry grounds), aroma (wet grounds), and a number of sensory traits including sweetness, acidity, body, flavor, and finish. Cuppings are conducted blind so as to allow for non-biased analysis.
Typically, we cup a few dozen coffees daily, looking at each sample from many different angles. Since the roast profile and roast degree play an important role in flavor development, we believe it is critical to view every individual coffee through many different lenses: sample roasts that are lightly roasted and provide an intense and clear expression of the coffee, production roasts of varying degrees, and coffees at various stages of aging. I liken it to the work of a marine biologist studying dolphins—to gain any real understanding requires intense study and observation over a period of time and in different sorts of contexts. Since coffee is a living, breathing thing, it will always change over time, and what held true last month may not be precisely accurate today. Thus, we have a great need for ongoing experimentation and study.
Sensory analysis is a delicate and sometimes elusive endeavor. To become a skillful cupper requires years of training and practice, just like playing a guitar. It means building a large reference library of coffees with a huge array of characteristics that will form the background against which new coffees are judged. It means fine-tuning the palate and teaching oneself how to concentrate at a very high level. Individual sensitivity levels are genetic and varying, but great coffee cuppers are not simply born; they become great after much study and experience. That’s not to say that untrained coffee lovers cannot detect quality—every coffee drinker can taste the difference between coffees that are sweet, clean, and highly pleasurable and those that are bitter, sour, or lacking in character altogether. We all come into the world with the ability to distinguish a ripe, sweet banana from a green, immature and astringent one. Coffee is no different!
Coffee roasting is an intensely dynamic combination of art and science wherein a batch of raw, green coffee beans is transformed into a caramelized state which can be ground, brewed, and enjoyed. The goal of the roaster is to unlock the many potential flavors that lie dormant within the green beans to achieve a delicate, nuanced, and balanced cup that best showcases the characteristics that make each coffee unique.
We refer to both the machines and the people who operate them as “roasters,” and we couldn’t have one without the other. Like a skilled painter or professional athlete, our roasters respond to a number of factors and react intuitively, drawing from their knowledge of green coffee and its inherent potential. As each coffee is treasured for its own specific traits and qualities, every roast is tailored to the individual needs of the coffee that is being roasted.
We are currently operating four gas-powered Ideal Rapid Gothot roasters at Intelligentsia: a -kilo and two -kilos in Chicago and a -kilo in Los Angeles. These machines date from the ’s and were handcrafted from cast-iron and steel in Stuttgart, Germany.
Very basically, these roasters work by spinning green coffee beans in a large, continuously turning drum. This drum is heated by jets of natural gas, and the heat is never applied directly to the beans themselves.
A typical roast takes approximately - minutes to complete, and a number of chemical reactions occur during this process as the beans change from their original pale green to a golden yellow, then orange, and eventually a deep, chocolate brown. The temperature in the drum starts at  degrees Fahrenheit and immediately drops to about  after the green beans are added. This temperature is then gradually brought back up to  over the course of the roast. At about  degrees and approximately  minutes into the roast, "first pop" occurs. This pop is caused by heated water vapor rupturing the cellular structure as it leaves the bean. Aromatic oils continue to work their way to the surface of the bean, and a few minutes later, “second pop” is heard. During the final minute, the beans are skillfully guided towards a delicate balance of acidity, body, and flavor. When the coffee reaches this elusive pinnacle of development, the beans are released onto the cooling tray to halt the roast process.
Over the course of a roast, the roasters respond to both the machine and the beans. They are constantly checking gas levels, time, and temperature, as well as the color, sound, and aroma of the beans. A few minutes (or even seconds) too long and a bright, medium-bodied bean with distinct blackberry flavor notes becomes a flat, papery-tasting brew. A temperature too low and the oils necessary to give the coffee its flavor will not come to the surface and the end product will taste starchy and lifeless.
After having traveled from origin by boat, green coffee is trucked to Chicago and Los Angeles in  or  kilo burlap bags. When it arrives at our Roasting Works, the coffee is stacked neatly on pallets, which we unload and store in two-tiered racks. Green coffee can be stored in this state for up to a year, although we have made a commitment to offer coffees that are ten months from harvest at most.
After the coffee is roasted and cooled, the beans are placed in food-grade bins and marked with their country of origin and the date. Intelligentsia’s Production Crew either scoops single origin coffees directly into our bags or creates blends in -pound increments. Blends that are sold in larger quantities (our Black Cat Espresso, for example) are combined in a large machine that blends in -pound increments. If everything goes according to plan, we have very little surplus roasted coffee at the end of the day.
Much like a painter combines colors to create new shades and hues, Intelligentsia’s QA team creates blends that combine the most appealing characteristics of several different coffees. The result is a complete cup that offers tremendous complexity and depth, with the added advantage that as coffees change and mature over time, the blend can be reconfigured or fine-tuned to maintain a consistent flavor profile.
Every bag is roast-dated before it leaves our warehouse. Coffee this fresh is still chemically reacting and releasing carbon-dioxide, so each of our bags is equipped with a valve to vent the pressure created by the beans de-gassing. The bags are heat-sealed, rolled down and taped or tin-tied shut. Our coffee is roasted to order and shipped that same day.
We deliver and ship to coffeehouses, upscale markets, cafes, and restaurants once or twice weekly. Currently, we have wholesale customers in all  states, Canada, China and the Cayman Islands. This year, we will roast approximately three million pounds of coffee.

Intelligentsia Coffee’s buying philosophy is not very complicated. We believe in coffee quality and have made a commitment to our customers to offer only truly dazzling Specialty Coffees that speak for themselves in the cup. We believe that to get such coffees we need to work closely with actual producers, not just importers or exporters, so that we can build great coffees from the very start.
Intelligentsia travels to our coffee’s source each of the  months of the year. We visit farms, roll up our sleeves, and get to it. We take -hour redeye flights and -hour, high-altitude pick-up rides over serpentine roads. You pick up our coffee and we shake the hand of a farmer in Peru. Or Rwanda. Or Guatemala. And when you see the Intelligentsia Direct Trade logo on our bag, you know how much effort is invested in each bean.
In the broadest terms, these coffees should be understood as a true collaboration, with both sides investing a great deal of time, energy and ideas to produce something great. At the end of this process, the coffee farmer who grows an award-winning cup is an artisan, and should be regarded as such. We believe human effort is the most critical factor in quality coffee and that the growers who do the best work should get the best price and individual recognition.

"Intelligentsias commitment to quality and education is inspiring. Our goal with the coffee program at the restaurant was to introduce our guests to a new experience with coffee. However, when we started training with our friends at the New York Lab, there was a large part of the staff that went to buy a Chemex and Grinder because of their own introduction to this new experience.
The team at Intelligentsia is as passionate about coffee as they are fun; they brought a ton of excitement to the plate that was easy to relay to our guests. Intelligentsia has enabled us to share world-class coffees with our guests, in ways that can easily be reproduced at home."

"Intelligentsia Coffee is an integral part of our business.  Five years ago when we opened The Grove, we chose to use Intelligentsia because we thought it was the best tasting coffee we ever had.  But beyond the amazing quality of the coffee, we have built a partnership with the company and with the wonderful staff.
The personalized service and the ability to support and help us with the many challenges a restaurant faces is the reason we continue to work hand in hand.  We appreciate Intelligentsia’s company philosophy and the standard in which they conduct their business.  They have truly inspired us to be a restaurant that does not overlook the importance of an incredible coffee program."

In October of  Doug Zell and Emily Mange left San Francisco to open an in-store coffee roaster-retailer on Broadway Avenue on the north side of Chicago. At that time they were simply hoping to bring great, fresh-roasted coffee to their own coffeebar with the help of a charming, but perhaps too often erratic -kilo roaster. Since then Intelligentsia has evolved considerably.
Intelligentsia now has three cities it calls home: Chicago—a city that is brooding, practical and reluctantly beautiful; Los Angeles—a city that views creativity as a birthright, is immensely vast, decidedly impractical and equally messy and marvelous; and New York—a city of paradoxes, hulking but chock full of intimate corners, timeless but achingly current, polished but decaying, worldly yet oddly provincial, all crashing together in perfect cacophony (or is it harmony?).
Honestly, we love all of these places, but for very different reasons. Straight backed-Midwesterness gives us pragmatism and self-discipline, West Coast optimism leads us to believe anything is possible, and the dynamism of East Coast is an unending source of energy. This combination provides the fuel for what we love to do: sourcing, developing, roasting and delivering the best coffee in the world.
Others talk about working with coffee producers and in many cases that’s all it is, talk. Intelligentsia’s buying team cumulatively spends over  days each year at source. We do not just buy coffees; we actually develop them while working alongside the farmers we work with who grow our coffee. Our coffees are unlike any others, and they are exclusive to Intelligentsia. We take insights, practices and expertise in preparation and processing garnered from our work around the globe and apply them to each of our Direct Trade coffees to make them the absolute best they can be.
We also want the growers we work with to prosper so we guarantee a price that is paid directly to them, which is set far above international fair trade standards. By combining focused attention at source with cup-quality price incentives, we continuously expand economic opportunity and culinary possibility.
In our coffee bars you can expect to find this remarkable coffee in all of its forms: whole bean, various approaches to brewed, and carefully prepared as espresso. Our goal is that each of these is presented in an environment steeped in education and humility. We want great coffee to be revered, yet democratic, approachable and accessible. By illuminating what is possible with coffee, we hope to change forever how you think about it. And that would be something.

Coffees designated as Intelligentsia In Season™ are less than  calendar months from the completion of harvest.
Coffee is just like great fruit and vegetables. Most coffee-producing countries have only one specific harvest season each year, and once the coffee is picked from the tree, it begins the inevitable process of slow decline, losing quality with the passage of time. The result is that no matter how great a coffee tastes while in its prime, the day will always come when it loses the very things that made it so tasty in the first place.
What then does Intelligentsia In Season™ mean? It means that our coffees are offered only while they are fresh and retain the vibrancy that both nature and the fastidious coffee farmer intended. It means that the coffee offers the same kind of compelling traits it did when we first selected it and brought it to our Roasting Works. The coffee industry has long perpetuated the idea that coffee is a year-round crop without recognizing publicly that the harvest cycles do not allow for this. So you really need to know when a coffee was actually harvested. Selecting your coffees in this way ensures that you are getting them while they are their most delicious.

From Intelligentsia’s inception in , we envisioned serving to our customers not only the world’s finest coffees, but teas of unmatched quality. A tea that simply tasted great was not enough; we were looking for teas with complex aromas, pristine leaf appearance, and tastes unique and unrivaled by anything to be found in the country, and we would settle for nothing less than an offering that reflected our belief that, rather than simply another daily ritual, tea is an ephemeral art form to be relished with all the senses.
In , the decision was made to put more emphasis on tea. Doug Palas was hired to source our offerings, bringing with him a renewed energy, a dedication to freshness and sustainability, and a determination to expand our potential as a company. With his knowledge of and passion for the traditions and techniques that lead to truly exemplary teas, we have developed a system of cupping that lets us taste harvests with a comparative and critical palate. 
While this may seem like an obvious process, far too often tea traders will purchase based on what they want to offer, rather than what is exceptional. At first, many tea brokers and producers balked at sending their teas to us for evaluation. The cost seemed unreasonable for such a small company as ours. However, as we have grown, the companies that were willing to take a chance on us then have grown with us, and have time and again shown that they share our dedication to the world’s finest teas. We have always sought out producers that we could trust to offer us their best, and we strive to earn the same trust from you.
We have learned many things over the years, and we will continue to learn and explore every facet of the tea business as the years go on, building upon our principles to offer our customers the most intriguing teas in the world. We wish to share this knowledge with you so that you can realize their full potential. We have seen these teas through their growth and processing, and we want to help you see this commitment through to the cup.

"Volta has flown the orange and grey colors of Intelligentsia from the moment we conceived of the shop. In fact, Volta wouldn't be what it is today without the help of so many people from the Intelligentsia organization. The Intelli staff are more than a company that roasts our coffee: from Southeast sales rep Chris Clements, to trainers who have worked with us in our shop, in Chicago, and through email and phone support, to sales staff and technical support, the people behind the scenes at Intelligentsia have provided professional support that has allowed us to excel.
They are industry leaders who have challenged us to push the boundaries of what a small, independent shop in a tertiary market can accomplish. That, and the coffees just keep getting better and better. Geoff Watts oversees a staff of green coffee buyers, QC evaluators, and roasters that not only delivers consistently amazing coffees, but they are literally pushing the envelope for quality at all steps of the supply chain, from farm to cup."

Zambian drought has led to concerns over water usage. This Pulped Natural SL- was produced using far less water than the fully washed method. The result is distinct, with a spiced apple cider flavor and hints of dried apricot and juniper.

This syrupy and sweet espresso blend has been the staple of our lineup since the very beginning. It is a product of intensive lot selection and close, direct work with the farmers who produce its components. The Black Cat Classic Espresso’s hallmark is its supreme balance and wonderful sweetness.

Zambian drought has led to concerns over water usage. This Pulped Natural SL- was produced using far less water than the fully washed method. The result is distinct, with a spiced apple cider flavor and hints of dried apricot and juniper.

Once again the New Year brings with it exceptional organic coffees from the Yungas forest of Bolivia. This season’s Anjilanaka, named for the indigenous Aymara word for “the angels”, offers pristine flavors of pear, malted chocolate and praline.
Nicolas Colque is focused on producing exceptional Bolivian coffees. With the help of Agricafe's Sol de la Mañana project, his efforts have yielded a lovely coffee with flavors reminiscent of apricot, black grapes and a pear tart.
The fully washed version of this Java Special Selection showcases many of the full-bodied and deeply layered flavor characteristics of its Indonesian relatives, but is still distinctly Bolivian. We are drawn to this coffee's mandarin acidity and clean flavors of papaya and fig jam.   
At altitudes reaching  m.a.s.l., Finca Takesi is the highest coffee farm in the world. Extreme temperature shifts between day and night slow cherry maturation, resulting in deep, sweet flavors of blackberry, plum and mulled wine.
We will select a different single origin In Season and/or Direct Trade coffee for this offering at random intervals. We may change what’s sent out within a week or within six weeks – it’s all dependent upon what coffee we’re excited about at any given time.  Reserve offerings will not be included as a part of this program.
For more than a decade, the Caballero family has been providing Intelligentsia with beautiful coffees we are proud to offer as La Tortuga. We enjoy this coffee's syrupy body and clean flavors of plum, brown sugar, and tamarind.

Zambian drought has led to concerns over water usage. This Pulped Natural SL- was produced using far less water than the fully washed method. The result is distinct, with a spiced apple cider flavor and hints of dried apricot and juniper.
A low yield this year in Zambia means that we bought nearly the entire supply of the Lublinkhof’s SL- coffee. The unique flavor profile of this variety and region reminds us of lemongrass and persimmon with turbinado sugar sweetness.
Camilo planted his Geisha nearly eight years ago on a small plot within the Santuario farm. It seems the coffee is really hitting its peak now; this year's version is easily the best we've tasted displaying ripe peach and plum flavors married with a maple sweetness.
To celebrate all that we’ve come to love about coffee in twenty years of reverence, we’ve made a blend that combines the most exciting, downright mouthwatering flavors this noble tree has to give. In abundance. Citrus, berry, floral. Respect.

This year's harvest from the colony of Taypiplaya has produced some beautiful coffees that we find irresistible as espresso. Flavors of sweet maple candy and clementine are given added complexity by a spicy finish akin to ginger ale.
This bright, floral, and complex Ethiopian espresso hails from the renowned Reko Washing Station in Kochere. It yields a plethora of juicy citrus candy flavors, elegant jasmine aromas, and warm hints of spice and cacao nib in the lengthy finish.
To celebrate all that we’ve come to love about coffee in twenty years of reverence, we’ve made a blend that combines the most exciting, downright mouthwatering flavors this noble tree has to give. In abundance. Citrus, berry, floral. Respect.
Our ­signature dark roast celebrates the savory side of coffees highlighted by caramelized sugars, molasses and chocolate flavors. We roast the coffee in a way that emphasizes these traits and creates a satisfying, resonant finish.

Our good friends from the state of Bahia have delivered an extraordinary coffee. This crop is clean with a pleasantly mild acidity, showcasing flavors like red grape, black tea, and toasted macadamia nut. 
Once again the New Year brings with it exceptional organic coffees from the Yungas forest of Bolivia. This season’s Anjilanaka, named for the indigenous Aymara word for “the angels”, offers pristine flavors of pear, malted chocolate and praline.
Nicolas Colque is focused on producing exceptional Bolivian coffees. With the help of Agricafe's Sol de la Mañana project, his efforts have yielded a lovely coffee with flavors reminiscent of apricot, black grapes and a pear tart.
The fully washed version of this Java Special Selection showcases many of the full-bodied and deeply layered flavor characteristics of its Indonesian relatives, but is still distinctly Bolivian. We are drawn to this coffee's mandarin acidity and clean flavors of papaya and fig jam.   
At altitudes reaching  m.a.s.l., Finca Takesi is the highest coffee farm in the world. Extreme temperature shifts between day and night slow cherry maturation, resulting in deep, sweet flavors of blackberry, plum and mulled wine.
We will select a different single origin In Season and/or Direct Trade coffee for this offering at random intervals. We may change what’s sent out within a week or within six weeks – it’s all dependent upon what coffee we’re excited about at any given time.  Reserve offerings will not be included as a part of this program.
For more than a decade, the Caballero family has been providing Intelligentsia with beautiful coffees we are proud to offer as La Tortuga. We enjoy this coffee's syrupy body and clean flavors of plum, brown sugar, and tamarind.

Zambian drought has led to concerns over water usage. This Pulped Natural SL- was produced using far less water than the fully washed method. The result is distinct, with a spiced apple cider flavor and hints of dried apricot and juniper.
A low yield this year in Zambia means that we bought nearly the entire supply of the Lublinkhof’s SL- coffee. The unique flavor profile of this variety and region reminds us of lemongrass and persimmon with turbinado sugar sweetness.
Camilo planted his Geisha nearly eight years ago on a small plot within the Santuario farm. It seems the coffee is really hitting its peak now; this year's version is easily the best we've tasted displaying ripe peach and plum flavors married with a maple sweetness.

From the frontier between Guji and Gedeo, we named this coffee for its village of origin – a local phrase meaning “Virgin Lion.” A lush and vibrant Ethiopian, it offers lots of fruit and floral flavors like kiwi, coconut, and peach blossom.
This syrupy and sweet espresso blend has been the staple of our lineup since the very beginning. It is a product of intensive lot selection and close, direct work with the farmers who produce its components. The Black Cat Classic Espresso’s hallmark is its supreme balance and wonderful sweetness.

How do I pick a coffee? Baffled about which coffee to pick? Take our Coffee Quiz! Or feel free to give us a call or email us (--- or help@lacolombe.net. Our Coffee Crew would love to help you find a coffee that suits your taste buds.  What are cupping notes? Does this mean your coffee is flavored? Our coffees do not contain added flavors. However, each of our single-origin coffees and blends has its own unique flavor. Those flavors and aromas come naturally from the coffee bean and can be affected by factors like country of origin, altitude, growing practices, processing techniques, and roasting styles. Coffees roasted more lightly have more of the characteristics unique to eachorigin, while those roasted on a darker level have more of the classic chocolatey and smoky tones found in our Classic and Reserve Blends.  The tasting notes that you’ll find on your bag of La Colombe coffee are what we taste when we brew and drink the coffee. By creating a simile between what we’re tasting in the coffee and familiar flavors we’ve had before (chocolate, apple pie, toasted marshmallow, etc.), it’s easier to communicate the often complex tastes that coffee can take on.  What grind should I choose? The choice of grind will depend on how you brew your coffee. Usually, we recommend ordering your coffee whole bean and grinding it fresh before you brew. But if you don’t have a good-quality grinder, let us pre-grind it for you! We recommend the following grinds for specific brewing methods: Drip for regular automatic drip coffee machines Melitta/Chemex for pourovers Turkish a fine grind for Turkish coffee French Press a semi-coarse grind for immersion methods Home Espresso a fine grind for home espresso machines Commercial Espresso an even finer finer for commercial espresso machines Percolator a grind only to be used for a percolator coffee maker  Why does grind size matter? Read more here. What are your café location and hours? Our national locations and hours can be found at our Cafés page here at this link.
What is the best way to store coffee? The best way to store coffee in an airtight container in a dark cupboard. There’s no need to freeze! Just keep your beans away from sunlight, air, and humidity.  How long is the shelf life? We recommend drinking your bagged coffee within  weeks of the roasting date. The coffee will not spoil after this date, but it will lose the amazing aromas and flavors we strive for in roasting.  Our cans of coffee remain fresh for about a year.  Our Pure Black cold-pressed bottled coffee has a shelf life of - weeks.  How do I brew coffee? There are infinite ways to brew coffee, and all coffee folks have their own strong opinions as to what makes the best cup. For our recommendations, check out our brewing tips video or our blog.  What is the difference between classics, reserves and single origins? What are seasonal single origins blends? At La Colombe, we have three different coffee lines. Classic Blends are our cornerstone blends that have been here since the very beginning. These are the coffees we drink on a daily basis, and if you’re new to La Colombe, we recommend checking them out! Reserve Blends are modern and refined specialty blends take you on a journey of different flavors, all while remaining within the traditional coffee wheelhouse. Workshop Coffees are roasted in small batches and come from a single origin, usually a single farm or specific region of a country. Our seasonal Workshop blends are comprised of multiple unique, single-origin coffees.  How do I return a product I did not like? If you don’t like a coffee we’ve sent you, no worries at all. From the day you receive your coffee at home, you have  weeks to let us know if you liked it or not. If you didn’t enjoy it, we’ll email you a return label and have you send back the undesired product. Then we’ll ship you another coffee of your choice! To return a coffee or another product, reach out to us at help@lacolombe.net.

Todd Carmichael and JP Iberti founded La Colombe on a simple but profound premise: America Deserves Better Coffee. By sourcing and roasting with care, and borrowing on ancient and modern coffee traditions from around the world, the two have built a successful company and an elevated coffee experience for Americans. Through  years of hard work and innovation, the two have made sure that experience is shared in cafes and homes across the country.
Todd Carmichael has lived and breathed coffee for over three decades. By pressing the limits of taste, service, and most notably, coffee sourcing – visiting the world’s developing countries to responsibly gather the planet’s best coffee – Todd has converted the nation’s culinary elite into La Colombe drinkers. Along the way, he has made his company the country’s leading coffee roaster while managing it philanthropically.
JP Iberti is the craftsman behind the company's urban-industrial café spaces, and artisan breads and pastries. Trained in a classical Italian café setting and transplanted into Seattle’s emergent s coffee scene, JP became entranced with the craft of roasting coffees beautifully. He abandoned an early career as a pilot to pursue the other machine that fascinated him—the coffee roaster. To this day, JP says that roasting coffee requires many of the same skills—attention, care, finesse—required to properly operate an aircraft.

Here at La Colombe, we are keenly aware of where our coffee comes from, how it was grown, and, most importantly, the needs of the people involved in the coffee’s journey from seed to cup. We care deeply about the wellbeing of coffee-growing communities, and we strive to implement the best business practices to increase that wellbeing.
As one of the early pioneers of direct trade, we pride ourselves on proactive, longterm relationships with small-holder farms and socially responsible coffee-growing associations. For us, the quality of our coffee starts with the quality of these relationships. By working directly with farmers to create mutually beneficial partnerships, we can increase transparency in the supply chain, guide farming practices to yield better and better beans, and support the livelihoods of coffee-producing communities.
Founded in  by La Colombe and the Clinton Foundation, the Haiti Coffee Academy supports coffee farmers in the southeast region of Haiti through education, training, materials, and market access.
Haiti is a place that is close to our hearts, and a place where coffee production has suffered in recent decades. We are committed to supporting the Haitian coffee industry by buying a significant amount of Haitian coffee each year and bringing their beautiful beans to the U.S. craft coffee market. Learn more about the Haiti Coffee Academy here.
Around the world, millions of people and thousands of communities lack access to clean drinking water. We believe that access to water is an inherent human right, and we partner with organizations who share this philosophy. By providing free drinking water in our cafes, we seek to raise awareness about water initiatives in the hopes that one day, everyone will have equal access to this life-giving resource.
Fairness – All trading partners are to be treated fairly. No strike price is ever to be below that established by the Fair Trade Organization. Additionally, farm workers' wages must be verifiable fair, working conditions must be humane and basic health must be made available.
Longevity – Long-term commitments are to be established with all coffee sources, thereby providing a more certain future for our trading partners.
Opportunity – Priority is given to nations, regions and farmers with the greatest need and where our purchases can make the greatest impact.
Water – Access to clean drinking water must be provided by the farmer to the families associated with our supplier farms.
Strictly Earth Conscious – Earth Conscious coffees are coffees grown on farms that hold at least two earth friendly certifications.
In addition to supporting our coffee-producing communities, we seek to support, nurture, and enhance the local neighborhoods that are home to our cafes. From providing free coffee to a nearby homeless shelter to helping with the community garden across the street, we work hard to engage with our environment and create meaningful connections with our neighbors.

We devote constant attention to Big Truck and think it might be the best organic espresso blend you can find. Coffee is a seasonal fresh produce and different producing countries have varied seasons and harvest periods. We strive to buy smaller lots in their prime to keep the blend as fresh as possible. The ingredients of the blend change based upon seasonality, yet the flavor profile for Big Truck remains the same.

Bourbon coffee cherries thrive at over , meters above sea level in the area of Nyamashekeon, on the southwestern shores of Lake Kivu, where several hundred farmers deliver their coffee cherry to the Birembo washing station. At the station, the seeds are de-pulped from the coffee fruit using disc depulpers. They are then fermented for more than  hours—imparting complex flavors—before being washed in long channels, soaked overnight, and then dried on raised beds. Organic production is common in Rwanda, though very few seek certification. This exclusive lot Micro Lot #, processed at the on the forth week of harvest, ranks as one of our top scoring coffees from Rwanda. We travel there annually to work directly with the Birembo station’s owner, C. Dormans, to cup lots of coffee separated throughout the harvest.

Bourbon coffee cherries thrive at over , meters above sea level in the mountains on Lake Kivu, where several hundred farmers deliver their coffee cherry to the Cotecaga washing station. At the station, the seeds are de-pulped from the coffee fruit using disc depulpers. They are then dry-fermented in tanks—imparting complex flavors—before being washed in long channels, soaked overnight, and then dried on raised beds. Organic production is common in Rwanda, though very few seek certification. We travel there annually to work directly with the station’s owner, C. Dormans, to cup lots of coffee separated throughout the harvest. This is the world exclusive lot to Olympia Coffee Lot  from the first week of the harvest.

Ben and Kristi Carlson are Americans who moved to Burundi with a dream to facilitate meaningful and direct relationships between coffee roasters and coffee farmers by producing great coffee and telling the stories of the people who grew it. The Long Miles Coffee Project is the fruit of their dreams and an important part of building a strong coffee sector in one of the poorest countries in the world. As part of the project, the Carlsons built a mill in the community of Bukeye and Kayanza where they purchase coffee cherries from the surrounding three hills, including Mikuba. During last year's harvest, Olympia Coffee sent staff to live and work alongside local farmers, cupping lots of coffee daily, resulting in this selection. To learn more about our work in Burundi, check out our video Coffee, People, Potential at olympiacoffee.com/videos.

“I’ll never stop learning and improving in high quality every day”, told Oscar Edgardo Tinoco to the Cup of Excellence following his  # finish. Since his first year entering his coffee into the Cup of Excellence, Tinoco is an example of how commitment to quality can change a coffee producer’s life.
Tinoco is a rd generation coffee farmer. He was given his own parcel of farmland from his father when he was just  and it wasn’t long before he’d taken over his father’s farm, Pino de Oro, on loan. Having heard of the Cup of Excellence on the radio, he was determined to enter Pino de Oro into the competition and first did so in .

Tart and concentrated, this honey-processed Gesha exhibits both the intensely sweet and juicy qualities of huckleberry with a hallmark Gesha florality akin to orange blossom.
The Gesha Cultivar is considered by many coffee professionals, connoisseurs, and enthusiasts to be the most intense, complex, brilliant cultivar ever discovered. Though Gesha gained its current acclaim from crops cultivated in Panama, its origin can be traced back to the fertile land on the slopes of southwest Ethiopia. From the birthplace of coffee, Gesha was transported across the world’s foremost coffee producing countries, finally landing on the shores of Central America in the s. Because of its unique traits from plant to cup, Gesha has built an unparalleled name for itself, and now we have access to the greatest cultivar ever discovered grown on some of the world’s greatest farms.
"A place very far away and hard to get to", as defines the word "Jurutungo," is the name of Graciano Cruz' farm in Western Panama.
In the seventies, Jurutungo was a freshly planted farm in western Panama near the Costa Rican border in a region called Piedra Candela. Jurutungo was planted with Catuai, Caturra and a modest hectare of the Gesha variety.
In , Graciano Cruz took over the overgrown farm and reinvigorated the land by stumping the existing trees and allowing them to regrow. The result; the rebirth of some of the world’s oldest gesha trees on one of the highest farms in Panama.
A North American exclusive offering, Evelia Maria Honey Gesha celebrates “old-vine” character and terroir of one of the most intriguing farms we’ve come across to date.

A delicate orange acidity is countered by a creaminess reminiscent of creamsicles.
Tarrazu is a region in Costa Rica that sits roughly  kilometers from the capital city, San José. It is in the Western portions of the Cordillera de Talamanca; a mountain range that spans most of Costa Rica and Panama and contains some of the highest peaks in all of Central America. With cloud coverage resulting from its close proximity to both the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, teamed with its mountainous altitude, Tarrazu's microclimate facilitates slow coffee maturation leading to the refined acidity and intense flavors we've come to love.

Run by the three formidable Calderon sisters; Yoanna, Diana and Yoxise, the Granitos de Altura del Ortiz micro-mill in Santa María de Dota is fueled by the palpable spirit, enthusiasm and, well… "Verve" that the Calderon sisters have for producing specialty coffee. 
While the sisters manage the milling of all of their coffees, their father Omar Calderon manages the family's seven farms.This catuai selection comes from their  meter farm known simply as Ortiz .

A malic acidity of red grapes is rounded by an intense brown sugar sweetness. Juicy and concentrated, the top-scoring Cauca lot exemplifies the red fruit and warming spice flavors characteristic of the region.
One of Colombia’s southernmost departments, Cauca’s Andean landscapes stretch as high as  MASL and experience more daily temperature variation than any other of Colombia’s coffee-producing departments. With cold nights as low as  degrees fahrenheit and days as warm as  degrees, coffee cherries generate and store higher amounts of the sugars that are ultimately responsible for Cauca’s complex cup profiles.
Fourth-place in Cauca’s critically-judged and highly-competitive "Best Cup" auction, Jairo Gomez’ coffee is praised for delivering on some of Cauca’s trademark characteristics; malic acidity, spice complexity and a weighted, concentrated body. Gomez’ small farm El Roble lies in the Almaguer municipality. Here his ripe Castillo cherries are processed on-site in the typical Colombian fashion involving an  hour fermentation before drying in his parabolic drier.

With a vibrant and unrelenting acidity, Karinga mimics a fruit punch characterized by flavors like tangerine and raspberry.
It's important to remember that despite it's neighboring proximity to Ethiopia, where coffee was first recorded in  AD; It wasn't until the late-s that coffee, of the Bourbon variety, was introduced to Kenya by way of the Indian Ocean island of Réunion.
Several decades later, in , is when Scott Laboratories was commissioned by the Kenyan government to develop the most commercially viable coffee variety in terms of drought tolerance, productivity and cup quality. Alas, SL- and SL- were born and have come to define the cup profile of Kenyan coffee as we know it.

Dominated by tropical fruit notes and a blood orange acidity; Karogoto is a dynamic Nyeri county coffee reminiscent of a stone fruit nectar. 
The Tekangu Farmers Cooperative Society has been around for a mere  years. Known for being one of the premier cooperatives in all of Nyeri county, they receive coffee cherries from over , member smallholder farmers via their three factories; Tegu, Karogoto and Ngunguru. This lot is a selection of only the finest and ripest cherries delivered to the Karogoto factory. 
Once received, the coffee is pulped, soaked in water for  hours, cleaned, soaked again and then dried on raised beds. This process, known as "double fermentation", is unique to Kenya. Thanks to the characteristic second soaking, organic acids are said to more fully develop and the green coffee's moisture content is equalized to ensure more uniform drying.
The Karogoto factory has been prized for its steady stream of spectacular lots year to year and this year is no exception. Karogoto is located just outside of the town of Karatina in a region noted for having abundant and consistent rainfall patterns. This plus the backdrop of Mt. Kenya and the Aberdare mountain range provide for the perfect climate to grow exceptional coffee.

Characterized by citrus fruit and subtle berries, Layo Teraga beams with a vibrant acidity and delicate complexity.
Three hours southeast of Yirgacheffe in the Oromia region of Southern Ethiopia, Uraga is a special woreda that serves as home to the Layo Teraga cooperative. Run by some of the most animated and enthusiastic people we came across during recent Ethiopia travels, it comes as no surprise that this coffee sings with complexity and character every time it lands on our cupping table.
The Layo Teraga Cooperative is supplied by approximately  member smallholder farmers scattered about the staggering altitudes found in Uraga. Ripe coffee cherries are disk-pulped and fermented for  hours before dried on raised beds. One of the hallmarks of great Ethiopian coffees, it is to this thorough process that coffees like Layo Teraga owe their cleanliness and delicate complexity.
Layo Teraga is located in a more arid climate than its neighbor Yirgacheffee. While arid, the area is loaded with semi-forested areas which allow for ample shade to give the trees respite from the sun. These attributes head led to an extremely dynamic flavor profile.

Another quintessence of a Farmlevel producer, Leonicio Castellon has been farming in San Luis, Honduras for  years. His sizable farm is just off a main road as you leave the town of San Luis. 
This is the second year he is putting the effort into producing specialty coffee and separating all of his Catuai from the lower quality Lempira variety. Though more labor and for a lower yield, the premiums he receives for outstanding cup quality are well worth the hard work. In addition to separating his varieties he is also using less herbicides and, rather, picking the weeds in the farm by hand. 
Last year he built his first solar drier on his farm to dry his coffee. The drier is sophisticated and going to be a perfect accompaniment to his farm. It will allow him to control the speed of his drying even more and produce repeatable results.

Syrupy and intensely sweet, like a raisin, Lucila Bolaños' coffee pairs red fruit with a clementine acidity.
When they arrived to the farm twelve years ago, they found not coffee trees but rather cattle pastures. Along with her husband, Marco Antonio, Lucila Bolaños began recovering the two opposing hillsides that make up Finca El Porvenir with castillo trees. 
As we walked the farm with Lucila and her family, her son-in-law, Jose, casually harvested banana, plantain, yucca and avocado from the trees that also call home to "El Porvenir" providing shade and windbreak to the coffee trees, as well as food to the Bolaños family. 
Lucila Bolaños castillo produce is processed in the typical Colombian small-farmer fashion where it's depulped and soaked in small, plastic fermentation tubs before drying in her on-site parabolic drier.

This distinct Antiguan is characterized by a vibrant, green apple acidity and a subtly floral aromatic complexity. A cocoa powder texture makes for a rounded and layered profile.
Miramundo is a project involving small shareholder farmers in the Pueblo Nuevo Viñas region, southeast of Antigua nearing the ocean.This region is host to many farms producing staggering quality. Thanks to the efforts of our friends at Finca Santa Ana and of the Bella Vista mill and Luis Pedro Zelaya; they have been able to separate some of the farmers producing high quality coffees, at perhaps smaller quantities in this area.This lot consists of three farmers’ lots, ranging in size from  pounds to  pounds. They mostly grow Bourbon, but have some Catuai growing in some of the newly planted areas. Farmers deliver their ripe cherry to Finca Santa Ana where it’s processed and dried on raised beds.

Our latest version of Streetlevel Espresso made up of two incredible fresh crop coffees from Guatemala.
Finca Candelaria is in the Alotenango region of Guatemala. In the past, coffees that came from Alotenango used to be labeled simply as Antigua because of its close proximity to the old town. Candelaria and other farms have created traction which has allowed for Alotenango to be seen as more than just Antigua's neighbor.
Our stunning lot of Candelaria was hand-selected by our green coffee team by cupping through multitudes of day lots from the estate. We chose only late-harvest lots that were filled with dense stone fruit character. These lots come from the highest portion of the farm and are made up of Bourbon and Caturra varieties.
The other component in our newest installment is a coffee called Los Santos. The coffees that make up Los Santos come from smallholder farmers in the Chimaltenango region of Central Guatemala. These farmers typically hold land between one hectare and  hectares. This specific region of San José Poaquil is fairly untapped, and most of the farmers have let their farms go wild. But, with immense potential, heirloom red and yellow bourbon trees and some guiding hands, the farmers are starting to receive premiums based on cup quality, which will quickly help the region's farmers understand its potential.
Streetlevel Espresso works perfectly as your everyday espresso or as a brewed coffee. This version we have been liking pulled fast and medium in output.

The Sermon is our fruit forward and heavy bodied espresso. A fresh, lighty tart blueberry and coffee cherry up front, with dark chocolate in the finish. These flavor characteristics blend incredibly well in milk drinks making a cappuccino with The Sermon decadent and dessert-like.
The Sermon has always been a new take on an old classic. A round body, heavy chocolate notes and berry sweetness are what we consistently strive for. We find coffees that suit this profile and create a blend that focuses on flavor, and highlights coffees from East Africa and South America. Fazenda Aurea a dry-processed Catuai from Brazil, offers a sturdy body and is a great background, while a perfect Guji dry-processed Ethiopia provides an intense berry note. Balancing out these extremes is a coffee from Colombia made up of smallholder farmers' coffees from the northern Cauca region; known for being clean, sweet and full of ripe fruit flavors. All together they yield an espresso that is both exciting and approachable.
The Sermon excels on a wide variety of espresso machine types (including the old-school, vintage lever machine types). We use a relatively standard approach on our more modern equipment. The Sermon is versatile, so a shorter shot tastes great too. Some folks also like to use the blend on their coffee brewer or press pot for a deep cup.

Jam-like in both texture and its intense sweetness, Worka combines a dynamic florality with mulling spice and wild berry flavors.
Sourced from among the  members of the Worka Cooperative, Worka owes its distinct complexity and clarity to not only meticulous processing featuring a Gaviota demucilager and channel-washing system; but the staggering altitudes and mystical terroir surrounding the Worka Kebele in Gedeb. It's needless to say, we're pretty head-over-heels for coffees hailing from this small but mighty community.
Upon it's  inception, Worka joined the twenty-six other member cooperatives affiliated with the Yirgacheffe Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union (YCFCU). Benefitting over , member smallholder farmers, The YCFCU is committed to supporting a sustainable coffee supply from cooperatives in the Gedeo ethnic region of Ethiopia.

Stout and creamy with carmalized flavors of chicory root

Two hundred years before we started selling our coffee in San Francisco, the French brought coffee
infused with stout, carmalized flavors of chicory root to the shores of New Orleans. Blended with
creamy whole milk and organic cane sugar, our ready-to-drink, cold-brewed version pays homage
to that tradition in a sweet, nostalgic carton.

Our road trip-ready iced coffee is made of three simple ingredients: coffee, water, and time

Designed to inspire adventure and movement, our portable cans promise days on the trail, at
the beach, and camping with friends-in one adorable and sustainable package. The taste is luminous
yet dense, bright yet chocolatey, small yet powerful.

In the late s, the Turkish army swept across much of Eastern and Central Europe, arriving at Vienna in . Besieged and desperate, the Viennese needed an emissary who could pass through Turkish lines to get a message to the nearby Polish troops. Franz George Kolshitsky, who spoke Turkish and Arabic, took on the assignment disguised in a Turkish uniform. After many perilous close calls, Kolshitsky completed his valiant deed, returning to give the Viennese the news of the Poles’ imminent rescue of their city. On September , the Turks were repelled from Vienna, leaving everything they brought: camels, tents, honey, and strange bags of beans, which were thought to be camel feed. Kolshitsky, having lived in the Arab world for several years, knew these were bags of coffee. Using the money bestowed on him by the mayor of Vienna for his heroic deed, Kolshitsky bought the Turks’ coffee, opened Central Europe’s first coffee house (The Blue Bottle), and brought coffee to a grateful Vienna.

 years later, in Oakland, Calif., a slightly disaffected freelance musician and coffee lunatic, weary of the grande eggnog latte and the double skim pumpkin-pie macchiato, decided to open a roaster for people who were clamoring for the actual taste of freshly roasted coffee. Using a miniscule six-pound batch roaster, he made a historic vow: “I will only sell coffee less than  hours out of the roaster to my customers, so they may enjoy coffee at its peak of flavor. I will only use the finest, most delicious and responsibly sourced beans.” In honor of Kolshitsky’s heroics, he named his business Blue Bottle Coffee, and began another chapter in the history of superlative coffee.

Now, more than  years later and thanks to the enthusiastic support of many loyal customers, Blue Bottle Coffee has grown to a small network of cafes, an espresso cart, and some vintage German coffee roasters. We are still united by the simple purpose of getting great coffee to everyone who asks for it. Improbably and delightfully, there are hundreds of us now. We roast coffee on vintage gear, put it in compostable bags, and still get it to our customers within  hours. We roast great coffee in four cities, make great drinks, clean up after ourselves, bake cookies, type up invoices, get change at the bank, and say please and thank you. We offer the elderly and pregnant our seats on the bus and brush and floss daily. We look forward to seeing you soon.

Because it was conceived just . miles from our Oakland roastery by Aerobie (those wonderful folks who created an improbably long-flying disc), we'd like to humbly assert that the AeroPress is our first locally-produced piece of merchandise. It’s a peculiar and lovely device – easily the most durable and portable option for brewing quality coffee. It produces a cup that’s thick and focused, but still quite nuanced.

Bring to a boil enough water for both the AeroPress and your brew vessel.  grams ought to do it.
Insert a paper filter into the AeroPress’s detachable plastic cap.
Grind your coffee. AeroPress calls for a fine grind – just a bit more so than drip coffee.
Assemble your AeroPress. Make sure the entire assembly is dry, since any residual moisture can compromise the device’s seal.
Place it on your scale with the flared end up, then tare the weight. The numbers should appear upside-down. It’s possible to attach the black filter cap and place it right side-up, but this tends to cause leakage and make accurate brewing slightly more difficult.
Add your ground coffee. Be careful not to spill any grounds into the ring-shaped gutter at the top of the AeroPress, as this can make attaching the cap a challenge later on.
Add twice the weight of water to your amount of grounds. For example, if you’ve got  grams of coffee, add  grams of water. Your water ought to be about  F.
Gently immerse the grounds with a bamboo paddle or butter knife. The goal here is not to stir them so much as it is to guarantee even saturation. Let this sit for  seconds.
Add another  grams of water and let sit for one minute.
Use the remainder of your water (it should be about  grams) to wet your filter and cap. The water will serve a dual function here: It will both help the filter adhere to the cap, and it will heat your brewing vessel.
After a minute has elapsed, give your grounds  vigorous stirs.
Screw the cap onto the AeroPress. You’re in very close proximity to seriously hot coffee here, so please be careful.
Flip the whole assembly over with haste and control and purpose. All three. Position it atop your brew vessel and begin applying downward pressure. You ought to experience about  pounds of resistance here. If the pushing feels too easy, your grind is likely too coarse; if it’s very hard to push, chances are the grind is a bit too fine. Your coffee’s fully brewed once it begins to make a hissing sound. This means there’s no more water to push through the device.
Now here’s the really satisfying part, for two reasons. Once you’ve unscrewed the cap, you can pop out the filter and the puck of condensed grounds by simply pushing the AeroPress’s interior section a final inch. Then, of course, you can pour your coffee and enjoy. And please do enjoy.

The Chemex's design has remained completely unchanged (right down to its charming wood handle and leather cord) since its invention in  by a German inventor named Peter Schlumbohm. Schlumbohm's designs were once characterized as “a synthesis of logic and madness”, and we're inclined to agree. Equal parts brilliance and common sense, the Chemex remains a staple in every coffee enthusiast's arsenal. Coffee from a Chemex is very similar to drip coffee, except that there’s more room for error. In order to guarantee the best results, make sure you’ve ground your coffee a bit coarser than in a ceramic dripper (there is, after all, more of it), and that you’ve given extra attention to your rate of pour. The upside? You can make enough to share with friends.

Bring to a boil twice as much water as you’ll need for the actual brewing (around ,-, grams for a -cup Chemex).
Weigh out about - grams of coffee (or approximately four or five tablespoons of beans).
While the water is heating, grind your coffee. The grind should be about as coarse as that of a French press.
Unfold your filter and place it in your Chemex, insuring the triple-fold portion is facing the pour spout and lays across it without obstructing it.
Pour in some of the extra water, fully saturating the filter and warming the glass. After about a minute, you can pour this water into your cup to heat that, too.
Pour your ground coffee into the filter and give it a gentle shake. This will flatten the bed, allowing for a more even pour.
Starting at the bed’s center, gently pour twice the amount of water that you have coffee into your grounds – for example,  grams of water for  grams of coffee. Work your way outward gently, and avoid pouring down the sides of the filter.
Allow the coffee to expand, or “bloom” for between  and  seconds. A solid bloom will ensure even water dispersion – and a delicious cup later on.
Continue pouring – delicately, beautifully – into the center of the grounds. You should pour at such a rate that the complete brew process takes about four minutes. Drink your coffee. Marvel at your dedication and skill. Repeat if necessary.

Like surprise parties, camping trips and the supplest of beef briskets, cold brewed coffee is best executed with a bit of foresight. The Filtron method is, for our money, the most reliable and delicious way to get complex single origin iced coffee at home. It takes about  hours overall, but the rewards for a little patience are many: If you, like us, have ever stepped onto a forebodingly hot New York street at : a.m., groggy but determined, you know that each sip is its own reward.

Place the Filtron’s rubber cap in the hole at the device’s bottom.
Wet your wool filter and place it snugly in the circular groove at the bottom of the Filtron. You’ll want to make sure this is in evenly; otherwise, you run the risk of getting an unsatisfying extraction.
Unfold your filter and place it in the Filtron. It will be a bit of a loose fit, so be sure to secure it evenly and fold it where necessary.
Grind the coffee into a stainless steel bowl (or anything else that’s large enough and won’t leech flavor). Cold brew calls for a finer grind – similar to that of AeroPress.
Add your coffee to the Filtron, then give it a few shakes to level the bed.
Pour your water over the grounds – carefully, of course – in a series of concentric circles.
Submerge the grounds with a butter knife or bamboo paddle.
Position the plastic disc filter atop the filter, then place the plastic top component on top of that. It's possible to add the water through this top part, but we've gotten better results by pouring directly on. In this case, the top component will just serve to keep any errant materials out of your coffee. Let steep for  hours.
Here’s where you’ll need a friend. Carefully position the Filtron over your carafe and swiftly pull out the rubber stopper. Often, you have a couple of seconds before the flow of coffee begins.

Arguably the simplest and cleanest way to draw out a coffee’s best qualities, the pour-over method is elegant without being prohibitively difficult. For those accustomed to coffee from a drip machine, this method will produce something similar but noticeably more delicate and complex.

Bring to a boil twice as much water as you’ll need for the actual brewing (around - ml).
Weigh out about - grams of coffee (or approximately two to three tablespoons of whole beans).
While the water is heating, grind your coffee. The coarseness should be close to that of sea salt.
Fold your filter and place it in a clean dripper.
Pour in about half of your hot water, fully saturating the filter and warming the porcelain. This water will also heat your cup or carafe. Let your remaining water sit in its kettle until it is about  degrees Fahrenheit. After a minute or so, empty your now-warm cup or carafe and prepare to brew.
Pour your ground coffee into the filter and give it a gentle shake. This will flatten the bed, allowing for a more even pour.
Starting at the bed’s center, gently pour twice the amount of water that you have coffee into your grounds – for example,  grams of water if you have  grams of coffee. Work your way outward gently, and avoid pouring down the sides of the filter. You’ll notice that adding this amount of water causes the coffee to expand, or “bloom.” Allow it to do so for between  and  seconds. A solid bloom will ensure even water dispersion – and a delicious cup later on.
Continue pouring – delicately, beautifully – into the center of the grounds. You should pour at such a rate that the complete brew process takes about two and a half to three minutes. All told, it should be about  grams of water.

French press coffee is dense and heavy. Though it’s sometimes criticized for being chalky, we think that a well-prepared French press is actually quite pure. But be careful: Of all methods, French press is perhaps the most vulnerable to over-extraction. For this reason, it’s necessary to transfer the entire contents of your pot to a cup or carafe immediately after it’s finished brewing.

Bring to a boil enough water for your French press. For a -oz. press, you'll need about  grams.
While the water is heating, grind your coffee. French press coffee calls for a coarse, even grind. We recommend starting with a : coffee to water ratio. If you're using  grams of water, you’ll want  grams of coffee.
To start, gently pour twice the amount of water that you have coffee, onto your grounds. For example, if you have  grams of coffee, you’ll want to start with  grams of water.
Give the grounds a gentle stir with a bamboo paddle or chopstick. If it helps, visualize gentle canoe paddling. Let the coffee bloom for  seconds.
Add the rest of your water and place the pot’s lid gently on top of the grounds. Do not plunge yet. Let the coffee steep for four minutes. Four. Don’t guess.
Gently remove your french press from the scale and place it on your counter. Press the filter down. If it’s hard to press, that means your grind is too fine; if the plunger thunks immediately down to the pot’s floor, it means your grind is too coarse. The sweet spot, pressure-wise, is - pounds. Not sure what this feels like? Try it out on your bathroom scale. We have. When you’ve finished pressing, serve the coffee immediately. Do not let it sit, as this will cause it to continue brewing.

Initially conceived as an alternative to the erratically composed and often disappointing iced latte, our New Orleans iced coffee is cold-brewed for  hours with roasted chicory and sweetened with organic cane sugar. The end result is a potent concentrate that we cut with organic whole milk. It's sweet, creamy and, perhaps most importantly, consistently delicious.

Just before you start the brewing process, grind one pound of coffee on a coarse setting.
Add the grounds and  g of roasted chicory to your stockpot.
Pour . quarts of filtered, cold water into the stockpot. Give the contents a few gentle stirs with a wooden spoon, so that all the grounds are visibly immersed.
Cover the stockpot. Let its contents steep for  hours at room temperature.
After the coffee's steeped, pour it through a fine-grained mesh sieve. Straining is easier if you first break the coffee crust with a wooden spoon. In terms of yield, look for about - cups of concentrate. As unappetizing as it may sound, the concentrate should resemble used motor oil.
Add  g of simple syrup to your concentrate and incorporate it thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Serve over ice, and add milk to taste. The concentrate/milk ratio should be roughly equal. Unsweetened concentrate will last for - days. Once sweetened, it will only last for - days. Once you add milk, hustle up – it’s only excellent for an hour or so.

Siphon coffee was invented in the s more or less simultaneously by a French housewife and Scottish marine engineer. It’s been refined many times, but a few principles hold true: It produces a delicate, tea-like cup of coffee; it can be quite persnickety; and it is, for our money, one of the coolest brew methods available.

After soaking your filter in a warm water bath for at least five minutes, drop it into the bottom of your siphon’s top component, or “hopper,” and hook to the bottom of the hopper’s glass tubing.
Fill your siphon’s bottom component, or “bulb,” with  grams of hot water (about a -oz. cup’s worth).
Insert the hopper, filter and all, into the bulb. You don't have to press too hard; just make sure it's securely and evenly in place. Position the entire assembly above your heat source.
While the water is heating, measure out between - grams of coffee and grind it just little bit finer than you would for regular drip coffee.
Soon, the water in the bulb will begin boiling and rise up into the hopper. For some physics-related reason we don’t fully understand, a little bit will stay in the bottom. Don’t worry about this little bit.
Once the water has moved into the hopper, turn your heat source down so that the water is between - degrees F.
Add your coffee, and gently (but thoroughly) submerge it with a bamboo paddle or butter knife.
Let the coffee brew, undisturbed, for one minute and  seconds.
In one brisk motion, remove your siphon from its heat source and give it ten stirs with a bamboo paddle.
Your coffee should take another minute or so to draw downward and finally rest in the bulb. You'll know it's ready when a dome of grounds has formed at the top of the filter, and when the coffee at the bottom has begun to bubble at approximately the pace and strength of a kitten’s heartbeat. Remove the hopper and serve. In order to guarantee the most complex cup, give the coffee a few minutes to cool.

The Bella is the wool sweater of our blends -- warm, comforting, familiar. Wild and citrusy organic African paired with earthy organic Indonesian makes for a vivid and fairly complex Moka/Java blend. It seems to weather the rigors of the automatic drip machine as well. This is, perhaps, why it's our most popular blend. It is also on the darker side: nice and thick without being inelegant. Bella stands up to milk or cream well, and is easily enjoyed black.

While many of our drip coffee blends are noteworthy for their low-toned sturdiness, Beta Blend is a bit of a different animal – glassy, complex, floral. A collaborative project between our Sourcing and Digital teams, it offers a daintier counterpoint to our Three Africans, Bella Donovan, and Giant Steps. It is available for online purchase exclusively.

Our blends are carefully chosen from two or three coffees for their harmonious relationship in the cup. Roasted with desired flavor profiles in mind, each blend combines varying regions, climates, and processing methods to arrive at something that’s as comforting as an old friend, but flushed with the excitement of first love. 

One -oz. bag of Bella Donovan, one -oz. bag of Three Africans, and one -oz. bag of Giant Steps.

El Sombrero is an exceptional coffee coming from the southwest of Colombia. Grown at high elevation in a humid, topsy-turvy area of the Andes, coffees from the Huila District are typically known for their intensity and buttery red fruits. El Sombrero, however, which grows in the speck of a town called Suaza, takes on a completely different and more delicate profile, demonstrating how microclimate and individual producers can significantly alter a coffee’s character. The masterpiece of a handful of farmers and producers, El Sombrero’s ripe cherry is hand-turned in fermentation tanks before being dried in miniscule batches. The result is a distinctive and jubilant washed coffee reminiscent of a brisk herbal tea with sweetgrass and florals. Its vernal qualities may make you pause to consider the absolute versatility of one plant: its open structure allows notes of lemongrass, brown sugar, and marmalade to linger gingerly in the mouth for a pleasantly long while.

A water process decaf that is vivid and packed with flavor, Decaf Noir is made from % organic water processed decaffeinated beans from Mexico and Sumatra. If you drink it strong, store it carefully and use it up quickly (buy a smaller amount and try to use it up in a week), you will be rewarded with very big flavors. The decaf Noir is surprisingly (some say freakishly) versatile: about the only preparation we don’t see consistently enjoyable results in is the siphon.

A blend of organic coffee that is quite dark and chocolaty. Maybe a bit more one-dimensional than the Bella Donovan, but it is a good dimension. Giant Steps is delightfully fudgy and thick in a French press or drip pot, and stands up to cream quite well. If it were any heavier-bodied, you could pour it on pancakes.

We developed this espresso over five years ago for the launch of our Kiosk on Linden Street. This is probably our darkest espresso: lower-toned, minimal brightness, plenty of chocolate – with an engaging complexity as a straight shot. The shots are gorgeous: achingly heavy with voluptuous red-brown crema, and the silky, somewhat dangerous-looking viscosity of a power-steering stop-leak product once used on our (now departed) heroically battered  Peugeot. In milk, it tastes like chocolate ovaltine, and holds its own from the daintiest oz Macchiato to our towering oz caffe latte. This is the most Brahmsian espresso we have. Brooding and autumnal, it is a coffee to mourn the passing of time.

Cristobal Fernandez has the patience of a farmer and the vision of an artist. In just a few years, he has transformed his mountainside farm from wild overgrowth to a productive mosaic of heirloom cultivars. Penetratingly cold nights slow maturation and prolong the season. The “Last Picks” is comprised of Cristobal’s final harvest of . More mellow and sweet than earlier lots, this cup seems to sigh delicious relief to have made it to the finish line after months of ripening on the branch.

Equal parts talent and luck, this Kenyan coffee hails from the southern slopes of Mt. Kenya, where conditions for coffee cultivation couldn’t be finer. Add to this one of coffee's best accidents—the diminutive peaberry—and you have a resounding cup. Many believe that the naturally occurring peaberry—where the coffee cherry produces one plump, round bean instead of two halves—doubles the flavor and sugar of the seed and is easier to roast. Year after year, Kirinyaga coffees are beloved for their ripe, fruit-forward profiles. This one, grown by smallholder farmers and processed at the Kirinyaga Factory, does not disappoint. Whether it’s the fine soil, the high elevation, or the influence of the otherworldly peaberry—this coffee sparkles. Imagine verdant kiwi, with its star-like glitter of black seeds, crossed with the tropical notes of lemongrass.

What’s in a name? Well, we’ve always been fans of the opascope, a beautiful tool for projecting handwriting and finely rendered artwork onto a larger surface. We could blab for hours about its quaint design, its bulky contours, its place in our childhood classrooms. But for expediency’s sake, let’s put it this way: The opascope is a tool for taking careful craftsmanship and opening it up for everyone to access and enjoy. Sound familiar? Available only in the Bay Area and online, the three-component Opascope Espresso is a refreshing addition to a lineup once dominated by dense, chocolatey selections. It yields an effervescent shot, packed with stripes of tropicalia.

What makes the Bushoki a paragon among Rwanda’s outstanding coffees? The landscape for one. Located in the north of the country, the Rulindo district is among the most mountainous in Rwanda, home to its tallest mountain, Mount Kabuye. Nestled amidst rolling hills, the Bushoki Washing Station sits in a shallow valley rich in groundwater. The ample water allows the station to process its Bourbon fruit in the style of a Kenyan coffee, where the cherry undergoes extensive scrubbing and pulping. The finer things in life tend to improve with age, and the Bushoki is no exception. When young, it’s explosively aromatic. As it settles, it does what Rwandan coffees do best: finds balance amidst contradictions. Where creaminess meets brightness, and ripe fruits marry with savory herbs, the silky, citric, and brisk Bushoki is a cup for the ages.

This coffee is generally a blend of Congolese and two different Ethiopians coffees. Together, these components produce a big, chocolaty aroma and excel in just about every prep method, save espresso and siphon. Unlike some of our fancy-shmancy single origins, this blend has a very easy-to-like personality, good body, unthreatening complexity, and a reasonably clean aftertaste. The coffees—two Ethiopians, one dry-processed and one wet processed; and a wet-processed Congolese—leave subtle imprints of dried blueberries and cardamom. A fairly dark roast, this inclusive blend will take milk or cream well. Some say damn well.

The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of , popularly known as Proposition , is a California law intended to protect California citizens from chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm and to inform citizens about exposures to such chemicals.  One such chemical is acrylamide, which may be present in coffee, including the coffee sold by Blue Bottle Coffee.  Acrylamide is a naturally occurring byproduct formed when certain sugars and an amino acid react to high temperatures, such as when coffee is roasted.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not determined that the low levels of acrylamide naturally found in roasted coffee have any public health impact. Your personal cancer risk is affected by a wide variety of factors. For more information on acrylamide, please consult the FDA’s website at fda.gov.  For more information about both acrylamide and Proposition , please visit www.oehha.ca.gov/prop.html.

Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these terms or our website will be instituted exclusively in the federal and state courts located in Alameda County, California. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.
(a) YOU AND BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER PRE-EXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, CONSUMER PROTECTION, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT, INJUNCTIVE AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN YOU AND US ARISING FROM OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THROUGH THE SITE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION. (b) The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (”AAA”) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the ”AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this Section . (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at ---.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to arbitrability and/or enforceability of this arbitration provision, including any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge that the arbitration provision or the Agreement is void, voidable or otherwise invalid. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity. Any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you prevail on any claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys’ fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees to you under the standards for fee shifting provided by law. (c) You may elect to pursue your claim in small-claims court rather than arbitration if you provide us with written notice of your intention do so within  days of your purchase. The arbitration or small-claims court proceeding will be limited solely to your individual dispute or controversy. (d) You agree to an arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute, NEITHER YOU NOR BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced.
No waiver by Blue Bottle Coffee of any term or condition set forth in these terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Blue Bottle Coffee to assert a right or provision under these terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of these terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these terms will continue in full force and effect.

We met Moisés Herrera and Marysabel Caballero—the couple that runs Finca El Puente—in . Since then, they have become like family and inspire us every year. From experimental coffee varieties and growing techniques to unique ways of processing, they push the boundaries of quality. This mostly Catuai-variety lot is lush with notes of Concord grape accented by a brown-sugar sweetness that finishes with a crisp, toasted nut character.
Recognizing Uganda’s incredible potential for quality, we worked with our partners at the Chema washing station to create some unique coffees. This lot was specially selected from the highest farms in the region and processed using underwater fermentation—in place of their usual dry-fermentation method—to create a momentous coffee with bright notes of black cherry and cola with a creamy body.
This coffee comes from the area of Calvas in southern Ecuador near the Peruvian border. Fifteen growers cultivated Typica and Caturra varieties on very-small organic farms to produce this single-community lot. Look for simple and sweet notes of chocolate and almond balanced by a creamy body.
Uganda is not a country well known for specialty coffee. Farmers in the lush volcanic hills of Mount Elgon grow excellent SL- and SL- varieties at some of Africa's highest elevations, but, for years, poor processing has held them back. The Chema washing station is pioneering processing improvements at every step to bring us a refined coffee with savory notes of stone fruit and cocoa.
This coffee is the result of the hard work of about two dozen small- and medium-sized family farms growing mainly Bourbon- and Typica-variety coffee in the small village of Bonta at approximately , meters. Small lots from these farms are processed and kept separate for us by the Colbran family—our long time partners in Papua New Guinea—to create a coffee that is savory, softly citric, and delicately tea-like.
The Orgánica cooperative in the region of Cauca, Colombia, has been creating coffee for our La Golondrina offering since . Over the years, they have shown they are one of the strongest organizations we work with—and it's no wonder they have one of the best organic coffees in the country. Look for layered flavors of milk chocolate, cherry, and nut.
The Idido cooperative is located just east of the small, bustling town of Yirgacheffe, Ethiopia. Its members—situated throughout seven communities in the area—are growing some of the highest-altitude coffee in the region. We work closely with this organic cooperative year after year to select their best coffees, which are known for their sweet and delicate floral, melon, and citrus notes.

	One day we realized that our coffee bags were more fashionable than us. To fix this, we partnered with Grand Rapids based designers Seth Herman and NoPattern to create apparel that even non-coffee-drinkers will love. Check back often for fresh seasonal designs.

	Each and every one of our coffees has a unique personality and special story. We love them all equally but for very different reasons, with each of them becoming like part of the Madcap family. We encourage you to check out each coffees story and its specifications to get to know them, and us, a little bit better. If you know exactly what region or flavor profile youre looking for, simply use the "filter products" tab on the top left to narrow things down. Enjoy!

	Located in the Nariño Department in southwest Colombia, Galeras is culled from micro-producers outside of the capitol, Pasto. All the farmers who contribute to Galeras grow coffee surrounding the active Volcan de Galeras, where it gleans its name. The climate here is dry and we believe that dryness, in combination with super-high elevations, accounts for the creation of some of the most complex coffees in Colombia.

	 is our first year working with this handful of producers in Nariño who own, on average, less than  hectare of coffee — an extremely small amount. To build this offering we partnered with a cooperative to help us separate great tasting lots and to build this blend. Our hope is to develop this relationship and grow our Galeras offering year after year. The quality is stunning, yet the potential for improvements is even higher.

	Over the last decades, quality coffee production in Rwanda has advanced substantially. Since being decimated by civil war and strife, coffee has become a major export in Rwanda, where more than three-quarters of its citizens subsist through agriculture. Investment in infrastructure to process coffee and close work with growers has increased production of specialty coffee, work aided by non-profit and government funded programs, some of which was advised by professionals in specialty coffee. Kanzu the Cooperative  has had the support of Technoserve, an organization that was also involved in Mutovu and Yukro. It certainly helps that Rwanda’s terrain is very mountainous, with the high elevations, healthy ecosystems and nutrient rich soil beneficial to quality production.

	The Kanzu name refers both to the cooperative and the washing station. Kanzu rests in a valley betwixt mountain peaks near the shores of Lake Kivu. Founded in  with the aid of Technoserve, Kanzu brings together the coffee from hundreds of farmers who harvest fruit from trees cultivated on the mountains above and deliver ripe cherry for processing. Old-growth bourbon trees and terroir of the Nyamasheke region provide the backbone for this coffee with powerful character and acidity, while a  hour fermentation process adds complexity. After harvest and drying in March-July, this coffee then faces an epically long journey from land-locked Rwanda here to the USA.

	Lush, deeply fruited, and juicy, Kanzu is vivid, clear and clean. This marks our third consecutive season purchasing coffee from the Nyamasheke region. This dynamic coffee represents the potential for high-quality in Rwanda, and elsewhere in Africa where excellent terroir can be at odds with challenges in infrastructure and government which make uncovering coffees like Kanzu difficult. We’re very excited to offer this coffee for Winter and Spring.

	Since , weve been captivated by the flavors coming out of Kayanza, Burundi. This year, the Kinyovu Washing Station, which is made of  individual producers, provides us with this coffee made up of % Bourbon varieties grown at  meters above sea level and the result is an intensely sweet and well-structured coffee.

	The Las Serranias is decaffeinated using the Natural Ethyl Acetate Method at the Descafecol plant in Manizales. Ethyl acetate is used as an extractor of the caffeine component of the coffee. Generally, this decaffeination process is performed using added chemicals. The ethyl acetate used in the Las Serranias, however, is obtained using fermented sugar cane (which naturally contains ethyl acetate), complementing the sweetness of the coffee. Rarely will one ever find a decaf coffee as sweet, complex, and enjoyable as the Las Serranias. Las Serranias is the exclusive decaf that is offered at Madcap as we are yet to find an option that comes close to comparing.

	Lucas Melo’s farm, El Cairo, is situated high above the town of El Tambo in the Nariño region of southwest Colombia, nearly flush with the equator. This location, warm breezes from the Pacific, soils rich in organic matter, and deep canyons where collected heat rises at night, make coffee production possible at very high altitudes, which is helpful in developing sweetness and acidity in the cup. Additionally, very consistent sun and rainfall ensure a steady growing environment.

	This terroir provides the habitat for a producer like Lucas Melo to nurture this stunning Caturra and Castillo coffee. To ensure a high-quality and tasty cup, he begins with diligent, selective picking followed by a detailed washing process that includes a -hour soak, followed by drying on plastic tarps outside his home. The resulting coffee sings with bright, clear fruit notes.

	As a multiple Cup of Excellence winning producer, Lucas’ coffee is highly sought after. We are very fortunate to be one of his few regular buyers since our purchase of his nd Place CoE lot in .

	Since , Luis Reinoso’s coffee has been a star in our lineup. That year we began to purchase coffee from Luis and his brother Didier. Luis’ Colombian farm, Finca Vista Hermosa, or, “farm with a beautiful view”, rests at roughly  meters above sea level, looking out on a mix of cultivated coffee and natural forest.

	This high elevation provides the coffee trees with cool temperatures and a lower oxygen environment associated to coffees with fine, bright acidity. Indeed, we find lush fruit flavors of plums, cherries and citrus defining Luis’ coffee as a filter or espresso brew. In cultivation are Caturra and Bourbon varieties, at a roughly - ratio, both of which are associated with lower-yield but high-quality cup characteristics. Having only two varieties is a risky choice  less biodiversity can increase the risks of disease ruining a large portion of his crop  but in addition to quality, just two varieties give Luis’ coffee very well-defined flavor characteristics.

	As many farms in Colombia do, Luis produces two harvest a year  unstable weather patterns close to the equator produce uneven flowering and fruiting of the coffee trees; Luis could be picking coffee twice a month year-round. His coffee is hand-picked, washed at Finca Vista Hermosa, and dried slowly on covered, raised beds. A thorough washing and even, slow drying encourages cleanliness and consistency in cup character.

	Luis lives on his farm in the Herrera, Tolima Region (a  hours off road drive from the little town of Rio Blanco) with his wife and  children. Hes a first generation farmer excited about growing great quality and partnering with a roaster to build a sustainable business. Full of lush fruit flavor, a clean and silky mouthfeel, and bright pleasing acidity, this is a world-class coffee.  We at Madcap are delighted to be the only suppliers of Luis Reinoso coffee in the world!

	Pepe and his son, also Pepe (who also has a son, you guessed it, named Pepe) got into coffee farming to give back to the earth what the earth had so kindly given to them. Pepe Mayor had the opportunity to see many parts of the world as he served as an ambassador of Ecuador in various countries over the years. Similarly, Pepe Menor traveled many parts of the world as a professional climber for a number of years, and he became the first Latin American to climb all the highest peaks in all  continents. After many years of traveling and spending time in nature, the father-son duo decided to start a coffee farm, rooted in the belief that their style of sustainable farming is one of the best ways to strengthen the ecosystem in their region.

	This special selection from the farm is made up of % Typica Mejorada, a Typica-like variety common in the area. The process of production is traditional, yet incredibly particular and detailed. Only “sangre de toro” (dark red) cherries are picked and pulped before receiving natural-air fermentation and thorough washing and slow drying on raised beds in the mountains. The process is kept simple, yet regularly tested, refined, and explored to make sure only the cleanest and tastiest results are coming out of each lot.

	The family-owned operation started farming coffee under the name Cafe Instinto (coffee instinct) due to their core values, which are “passion and instinct.” They strive to work in harmony with the land as much as possible and to test out many farming techniques to minimize their footprint on the land. The farm pays their workers some of the highest wages we’ve seen and also offers competitive salaries and benefits to their full-time employees.

	With all of the diligence and care that goes into the process, the cost of production is quite high, but so is the quality of life and work environment on the farm. While the process places a heavy emphasis on quality, the real secret in producing such vibrant and unique coffee, according to Pepe Menor, is that the coffee is alive. The coffee experiences the passion of the family as every single seed is individually touched at at least one stage in the process. Each night the coffee listens to classic rock on vinyl (particularly Jimi Hendrix) as it is blasted from the system of their bamboo home located in the center of farm.

	Taste through the seasons at Madcap with the -month Roasters Choice Subscription.  On the first Thursday of every month we will ship you a oz bag or bags of a hand selected offering from Coffee Buyer Ryan.  Each month will be a unique offering of Ryans current favorite fresh coffee on the menu.  Plan accordingly and you will never have to worry about running out of Madcap at home.

	Only available to customers living in the United States.

	The San Sebastian is a coffee showcasing the work of small shareholders in the municipality of La Plata in Huila. The coffee is produced by the Asociacion de Productores de Cafe de Alta Calidad del Occidente del Huila (OCCICAFE).  The profile found in this coffee is the result of piecing together around  exceptional lots to create a clean and sweet cup.  Nearly one thousand lots are cupped to build a lot of this size and quality. The growers involved in OCCICAFE all work side by side with quality analysis and are responsible for the harvesting, milling and drying of their coffee. La Plata is a small town of about , residents which was initially named San Sebastian de La Plata by early settlers. While La Plata has historically been known for silver, today’s economy is mostly agriculture. This season will mark the th harvest we have purchased from San Sebastian!

	In honor of our hometown area code here in Grand Rapids, we dubbed this blend Six One Six. Six One Six is enjoyable, trustworthy, and balanced: designed to be a delicious coffee that everyone can savor and trust everyday, much like the city itself. Embracing our commitment to seasonal changes in coffee harvests, the coffees in Six One Six change throughout the year, lending subtle flavor differences that keep this blend interesting. 

	The Spring Fling is a lively Madcap blend to celebrate the spring season. It’s full of life and new beginnings with sweet, delicate, and floral flavor.  This is another seasonal blend that carries our intention of stepping outside of the box to create an exotic experience made up of a couple of our finest fresh crop offerings.  It’s the perfect beverage to enjoy while flowers blossom and the birds start chirping.

	Embracing our dedication to excellent coffees, the Third Coast Espresso blend uses several of our best coffees in the course of the year to produce a luscious espresso: sweet, flavorful, and complex in its pure form, yet robust enough to support milk drinks. Careful observation throughout the year will yield the joy of tasting subtle, seasonal flavor changes. The Third Coast Espresso produces a rich texture, mixed berries, vibrant acidity and a balanced creamy body.

	We roast Sunday through Thursday. Once you place your order, you can expect it to be roasted and shipoed within  hours. Orders placed closer to the weekend may have to wait longer.

	Delivery time for UPS SurePost is dependent upon how far you are from Grand Rapids, Michigan but is anywhere from - days. We also offer  Day Select, nd Day Air and Next Day Air if you need your coffee to arrive sooner. Place your orders accordingly! Once your order is shipped you will recieve an email with your tracking number. 

	We do! If you have questions regarding your international order please feel free to email us at roast@madcapcoffee.com before you place your order.

	Of course you can. We strongly encourage you to grind your own coffee to achieve an optimum flavor experience but we will grind coffee on request. Select the appropriate grind in the shopping cart.

	All of our coffees are given a roast level that we feel brings out their best flavor. For us, roasting goes beyond color, which is why we focus more on sharing flavor profiles rather than information on the roast itself. The majority of our coffees are somewhere in the medium-light to medium roast range.

	We are happy to answer, neither. Weve developed a way of sourcing coffee that we really believe in and that we feel, at least for us, works better than Fair Trade or Direct Trade. Madcap spends time every year visiting our producers and building relationships on the farm level. We work closely with every link in the supply-chain to ensure that quality and sustainability are top priorities. When buying coffee from farms we havent yet visited, we use well-established organizations to assist with sourcing that are aligned with our core beliefs and interest in transparency. So in essence, our coffees are both fairly traded and directly traded, just not certified.

	Like all produce, coffee is seasonal. With our sights focused on quality, we purchase our coffee during harvest and only feature it while it lasts, usually about three or four months. We know it can be frustrating to fall in love with a coffee and then have it soon disappear, but think about how exciting it will be next year when its season rolls back around.

	Simply use the bag your coffee comes in, keeping it rolled up tightly and out of the sunlight. We encourage you to use your coffee within one month of the roast date and keep it away from the freezer. Every time you freeze your coffee a Madcap barista loses a tip.

	There are numerous ways to make coffee and no single way is correct. But heres some main pointers:
	. Use filtered water. Water makes up % of your final product, so water quality plays a huge role.
	. Make sure your water is between - degrees Fahrenheit. This is necessary to properly extract the awesome flavor.
	. Grind coffee fresh right before brewing.
	. Use roughly  grams of coffee for every  ounces of water.
	. Have fun and drink responsibly!

	This months menu highlights a bit of Latin flair

			We’re a coffee roaster but to say we’re passionate about coffee is far too simple. For us, the all-consuming life of a coffee begins when we travel worldwide to collaborate with producers that go all out to produce a coffee beyond compare. We then work directly with them at ground level on projects to introduce modern technology and sustainable methods to improve their farms. But at the end of the day, we’re coffee nerds hell-bent on sourcing, roasting and serving the best coffee possible. So, passion? It doesn’t even begin to describe us. Below you can purchase fresh-roasted whole bean coffee for home.
		
Our coffees are directly sourced from producers in many countries. With such a vast array of climates and altitudes, harvest and availability schedules differ depending on where the coffee was sourced from. Our Global Coffee Harvest Schedule is a rough guide to show you when a harvests generally occur in a country and what months well most likely have your favourite coffees available.
We are currently working directly with coffee producers worldwide from Bolivia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Ethiopia and Kenya to improve the quality of our coffees from the very start of their journey. From the agriculture, processing, and drying stages to the transportation and roasting, we care deeply about producing the best coffee we can buy, and are constantly perfecting it so we can share these coffees with Canada and the world.

At our Calgary, Canada coffee roasterie, we personally ensure our coffees are roasted carefully, leveraging experience and technology to improve consistency in every roast batch. As we roast, we strive to highlight the unique characteristics of each of the coffees we source. The result? What we hope is some of the most delicious coffee you can buy in Canada and maybe even the world.

Browse our coffee online by the distinct regions they’re grown, or explore different taste profiles to find the best coffee for you. You can order any of our in-season coffees directly and we’ll have them delivered right to your door. If you’re looking for unroasted coffee, it is available via our green coffee subscription.

			The potential of Bolivian coffees intrigued us and we’ve been traveling to source unique offerings from the countrys diligent producers since . But after our trips, we knew there was room for improvement. Currently we’re involved in projects with producers from the remote communities of Villa Imperial and San Luis in the Taipiplaya region as well as communities in the Loa region to improve their methods. We’ve also developed a strong relationship with the Buena Vista mill near the city of Caranavi, strengthening our ties to the community.
		
We started our work in Bolivia in  with ASOCAFE, a mill and cooperative near the remote coffee communities of Villa Imperial and San Luis. Being so high up in the mountains, these communities dont process their own coffee and instead opt to bring it down to the nearby ASOCAFE. We saw a lot of potential in these incredible coffees grown at high elevations and have worked with the producers to improve their methods through giving feedback on picking techniques, and better prices for quality. Weve also done extensive work over the past several years with ASOCAFE to improve their processing methods, particularly when it comes to drying. By financing and building raised drying beds and shading structures, we were able to help them to dry coffees slowly and evenly. Weve also bought GrainPro bags to store the coffee once it is dried, helping to protect it from humidity in the warehouse and during its treacherous journey to the mill in the Bolivian capital of La Paz.
In , we started working with another Bolivian coffee mill called Buena Vista in Caranavi. This mill is quite sophisticated and we are excited about the opportunities to experiment and build larger lots of coffee from Bolivia – most farmers in Bolivia produce very small amounts of coffee. From our relationship with Buena Vista, we discovered a couple great producers who were keen to continue to build relationships with: Juan Coquira and Celia Condori.
Coffee from Bolivia has the potential to be truly incredible, and each year we work more with the Bolivian people, were seeing more of this potential realized. Sebastian travels there frequently, working closely with the communities and the mills to monitor and improve, as well as fostering new found friendships with the producers and their families.

			Colombia is a very well known and celebrated coffee producing country known for its range of flavour, sweetness and acidity. Coffee is an important part of its history, with many of the coffee growing regions in the country listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites. Weve been sourcing coffee from Colombia since  and have focused on building relationships with producers in the Huila region, one of the most notable for quality. This has led to some great relationships, like with our long-time friends the Guzman Brothers.
		
Coffee in Colombia, though very exciting, can be quite a challenge as many farms in the country value yield over quality processing. This can traced back to federally funded programs aimed at increasing production. These programs are beneficial for many producers but arent always the best strategy for inciting quality coffee producers. The programs often focus on fast and hot drying systems, which are quite damaging to quality coffees and negatively affects their shelf life. What gets us going when it comes to Colombian coffees are the relationships that weve been able to develop with producers who are truly interested in improving quality and are passionate about their product. Kindred spirits, if you will. This is what weve found in the Guzman  Brothers.
Audenar, Alirio and Abelardo Guzman have been our partners and friends since , and have implemented projects to improve picking coffee cherry, processing, drying and storage. Weve helped them design and build raised drying structures that optimize conditions by shading the coffee and improving the air-flow. Each brother monitors the drying coffee five times a day in order to achieve the ideal moistures and water activity. To protect their coffee from high humidity and temperatures, they store everything in GrainPro at their farm until they can make a delivery. This diligent work has led to some outstanding results and provided us with our best Colombian coffees for the past two years. In order to show our appreciation, we enthusiastically agreed to a three-year contract, committing us to buy all the quality coffee they produce.
Were also in the process of seeking out more producers who are interested in working with us to improve the quality of their coffee. A challenge, yes, but weve been inspired by what we accomplished with the Guzmans and hope to repeat the success story.

			We really love Costa Rica: the people, the landscape, and, most importantly, the coffee. Our love affair with sourcing from this country began in , and in that time weve been lucky to partner with many great producers and mills. Whats most exciting about Costa Rican coffee is the producers have the education, means and incentive to invest in their farm and turn their coffees from great to truly exceptional.
		
On our first visit to Costa Rica we established a friendship and partnership with Juan Ramon Alvarado and Francisco Mena, the owners of Exclusive Coffee, at the time, a start-up boutique exporter. Through this partnership, we have established some amazing relationships and forged some meaningful friendships with producers.
In , we began working with Ricardo Perez and Marvin Rodrigues, owners of a mill called Helsar de Zarcero. This partnership has flourished as we have invested in working with several of the mill’s best producers and have devel-oped long-standing relationships with them. Over the past five years, we have expanded our scope to include some great relationships with producers across the country from the West Valley to Tarrazu.
Most notably, we have worked on two projects with Helsar: one to improve the drying of the coffee and help improve shelf life and another initiative to help farmers pick better coffee cherry. We have seen success with both of these initiatives but, while picking culture has proven hard to change, our drying projects have proliferated and have now been implemented with all of our partners.
The drying projects involve significant commitment from each producer. The infrastructure is not simple, the logistics are detailed and the amount of time required is onerous. We work closely with each producer to ensure that this process goes smoothly and we visit their farms two or three times a year to help them make any necessary tweaks. We have seen great results from these projects and have seen significant improvements in how long they last without losing vibrancy. We communicate throughout the year and provide feedback to the producers, always thinking about projects for the upcoming harvest.

			Ethiopia is known as the birthplace of coffee, which makes it pretty special. The climate and growing conditions are ideal and many of the varieties are descendants of the original cultivar, giving them an exalted status among coffee enthusiasts. We’ve been sourcing from Ethiopia since  and are striving to build strong relationships with many of its amazing coffee producers.
		
Sourcing from and traveling to Ethiopia is no walk in the park, especially when faced with the formidable challenges around navigating politics and poor infrastructure. Despite the obstacles, there is truly an abundance of quality coffee available and weve always managed to find some excellent offerings. Like in other coffee origins, our goal is to do collaborative work within Ethiopia but this isnt always possible due to complications like politics, financing, logistics or lack of education. While we are working at developing essential relationships, we continue to find incredible potential in the country in coffees through established importer/exporters.

			Though a small country, Guatemala produces some exceptional coffee. Weve been visiting since  and have developed great relationships with farmers like Ricardo Zelaya and Patricia Perez. Guatemalan coffee can be very interesting, complex, and has so much potential. Over the years weve been fortunate to see a lot of this potential realized in through our partnerships and projects with amazing coffee producers.
		
Our long-standing relationship with Luis Pedro Zelaya and his cousin, Ricardo Zelaya can be traced back to our initial visits in . This family has earned respect amongst coffee roasters worldwide. Both Luis Pedro and Ricardo take great care of the coffee from the picking all the way through the processing stage. In the last few years weve made some large investments into their farms to improve picking — over % picked is now ripe cherry! — and have supported them as they built new drying greenhouses with raised beds. 
Over the last three years weve also worked closely with Patricia “Paty” Perez and her farm, El Diamante. Her very remote farm produces some of the best coffee from the area. Recently, we spent some time on Paty’s farm and helped her build new raised drying beds. We provided her with a moisture meter to properly determine end point and coached her on how to manage the beds properly. Patys enthusiasm for the projects is infectious and we both couldnt be prouder of the results. Shes excited to work with us next year on extending this project. 
For the past two years we have worked with Tono Hernandez, a small producer who delivers cherry to Luis Pedro. Weve collaborated with Luis Pedro on projects to ferment and dry his coffees separately, something we believe can infinitely increase its potential. Luis Pedro has also worked closely with Tono to make improvements on his farm. As a result of this work, weve seen the quality and consistency of his coffee improve tremendously and are excited to continue the partnership.
All of this work that we are doing in Guatemala is very rewarding, as it allows us to realize the incredible potential of Guatemalan coffee.

			When you say Honduran coffee, it hasnt always invoked an opinion of Hey, thats good coffee. But in recent years, Honduras has really begun to shine. The growing levels of support from quality-minded producers has resulted in a spike in the coffees potential. Weve already seen a lot of this potential realized since we started traveling there in  and working on improvement projects. Were curious and excited to see how these projects will help improve coffee prospects in the years to come.
		
Honduran coffee, particularly from the Santa Barbara region, has been some of the best coffee that weve tasted in Central America. However, this region doesn’t come without challenges. One problem weve experienced is premature aging due to improper drying. This is compounded by the very humid climate, which makes it technically challenging to dry a coffee slowly and evenly. 
When Sebastian first tasted coffee from Benjamin Vallecillo, Wilmer Dubon, Margarito Herrera and Cristian Fernandez, he was blown away by the potential of these four producers from the Santa Barbara regions. The problem? Their coffees didnt perform well by the time they arrived in Calgary. So in , Sebastian returned to Santa Barbara to work with all four and subsidize the construction of new raised beds covered by plastic, called parabolic driers. We modified the sides of each structure so they could be completely opened during the day, to keep the temperature down and improve airflow, and closed at night, keeping the humidity out. We also provided the producers with GrainPro bags that hermetically seal the coffee once it has been dried to prevent it from being damaged by high humidity levels while in both the warehouse and in transport.
This year, we have seen some excellent coffees and are confident our work will continue improve the longevity of the coffee.

			Known for a unique quality of processing and drying, coffee from Kenya is very exciting. Its washed and soaked twice in a style called “Double Fermentation” and then dried on raised beds. As with all styles of processing, when done well it can yield unparalleled results. Weve been traveling to Kenya ourselves since  and over the years, have had the privilege of many of their phenomenal coffees passing through our roasterie.
		
Coffee production in Kenya is handled mainly by co-ops, and every factory or washing station sorts its coffee by bean size, with AA being the largest. Many in Kenya believe that the larger the coffee bean, the higher the quality, which drives prices much higher for those given the AA grade. While this is often the case, we believe that the AB coffees can be just as good.
Kenyan coffee runs on a well-established auction system. Each week, all the bidding exporters will cup and taste over  coffees to decide which ones to buy through the auction. Although its a strong system for buying coffee, our preference is always to work more directly with particular factories year after year. Thankfully, great exporting companies like Dormans Coffee allow us direct access through their sister company Coffee Management Services (CMS) to all the lots of particular top factories or washing stations that we enjoy. We pay a premium for these coffees (higher than auction prices) but we believe it’s well worth it for the chance to have the same Kenyan coffees every year.

			Panama is a great country to buy coffee from. It is easily accessible and the farms that we work with are impeccably kept, produce wonderful, clean coffees, and they are constantly refining and innovating the processes that they use. This has allowed us to build strong relationships in Panama based on trust. These relationships have created opportunities for us to experiment and learn about varieties and processing methods in tandem with our partners.
		
We have had a long-standing love of Panamanian coffee and, in particular, the Hartmann Family Estate. Our relationship began back in , before we started roasting and sourcing coffee directly ourselves. When we finally had the opportunity to travel to Panama in , the Hartmann farm was our first visit. We were immediately impressed by the family’s desire to learn and constantly improve their practices. We regularly communicate with the Hartmanns; giving them feedback on the condition of the coffees and brainstorming on how we can improve for the coming harvest. This tight feedback loop has allowed us to accelerate our iteration process and make on-the-fly adjustments. This relationship is directly responsible for some of our perennial favourite coffees.
We have also worked closely with Carlos Aguilera and his farm, Carmen Estate, since . Carlos has a beautiful farm and puts a lot of care into the processing and drying of his coffee. He uses a guardiola to dry his coffee and is extremely careful to dry the coffee slowly and consistently. His coffees are impeccably clean and always have stable moistures, which allow them to perform remarkably well over time.
Working with people like Carlos and Ratibor make us really excited each year to share these exceptional coffees with you!

			We’re a coffee roaster but to say we’re passionate about coffee is far too simple. For us, the all-consuming life of a coffee begins when we travel worldwide to collaborate with producers that go all out to produce a coffee beyond compare. We then work directly with them at ground level on projects to introduce modern technology and sustainable methods to improve their farms. But at the end of the day, we’re coffee nerds hell-bent on sourcing, roasting and serving the best coffee possible. So, passion? It doesn’t even begin to describe us. Below you can purchase fresh-roasted whole bean coffee for home.
		
Our coffees are directly sourced from producers in many countries. With such a vast array of climates and altitudes, harvest and availability schedules differ depending on where the coffee was sourced from. Our Global Coffee Harvest Schedule is a rough guide to show you when a harvests generally occur in a country and what months well most likely have your favourite coffees available.
We are currently working directly with coffee producers worldwide from Bolivia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Ethiopia and Kenya to improve the quality of our coffees from the very start of their journey. From the agriculture, processing, and drying stages to the transportation and roasting, we care deeply about producing the best coffee we can buy, and are constantly perfecting it so we can share these coffees with Canada and the world.

At our Calgary, Canada coffee roasterie, we personally ensure our coffees are roasted carefully, leveraging experience and technology to improve consistency in every roast batch. As we roast, we strive to highlight the unique characteristics of each of the coffees we source. The result? What we hope is some of the most delicious coffee you can buy in Canada and maybe even the world.

Browse our coffee online by the distinct regions they’re grown, or explore different taste profiles to find the best coffee for you. You can order any of our in-season coffees directly and we’ll have them delivered right to your door. If you’re looking for unroasted coffee, it is available via our green coffee subscription.

Where should we send your coffee? You can change this as often as you want so your super-fresh coffee follows wherever you go.
Our name is a nod to the vast array of amazing farms we are surrounded by, many of whom participate in the CSA model (Community Supported Agriculture), which enables customers to buy a weekly farm ‘share’ of produce.
We ship our coffee through the United States Postal Service. Based on your location, we use either First-Class or Priority Mail.
Shipping is included in the price of your weekly share.
We believe so strongly in the power of super-fresh coffee that we only deliver to you weekly what you will drink in  to  days. If we sent you enough coffee for two weeks--or even worse an entire month--it would begin to lose it's vibrancy before you could finish half of it.
          Think of it like this: You'd never buy a month's worth of farmstand veggies at a single time. Likewise, we can't let you drink stale coffee. You can easily change the amount we deliver weekly from your dashboard.
Of course you can, anytime. You won't be billed or sent coffee until you resume your account.

          But why not share it with a friend? The same way you would with your weekly farm share if you were out of town, or abstaining from vegetables for a week. Just add a new shipping address for that week's coffee delivery.
Because of our commitment to freshness, we do not ship internationally.
You have the option to be billed weekly, every four weeks, or every  weeks. If you choose weekly, your card will be charged two days prior to roast day. For example, if your order is scheduled to roast and ship on a Monday, you will be charged on Saturday.
If you are unsatisfied with your purchase for any reason contact us and we will make it right.
Our coffee is only available as part of a subscription (weekly share). Our company is specifically designed to deliver super fresh coffee to weekly shareholders.
We roast and ship our coffee on the same day. No exceptions. Depending on where you live, you will receive your coffee in  to  days.
We only ship our coffee whole bean to keep all of that super-fresh flavor intact.
Absolutely! Whenever you want. Simply log into your account prior to :pm on Sunday night before we roast your coffee.
Absolutely! Whenever you want. Simply log into your account prior to :pm on Sunday night before we roast your coffee. This is even possible with prepaid subscriptions.
Coffee is a crop, and crop cycles vary around the world. We are committed to bringing you coffee from the most recent and freshest harvest. We'll always try to match the flavor profile of the coffee type (Comfort or Adventure) you've chosen, but you can easily switch it to another available offering from your dashboard.
Our bags are adorable, and functional. We use the  ounce bag for two very important reasons:
•Freshness. Once your super fresh coffee is exposed to air its special flavors and aromas begin to decline. By not opening that second or third bag until you need it, you keep that coffee at its freshest.
•Variety. The smaller bags give you the flexibility to try more coffees.
If you are interested in larger quantities delivered weekly, contact us at [emailprotected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='x'+a.substr(,)|,n=;a.length-n;n+=)e+='%'+(''+('x'+a.substr(n,)^r).toString()).slice(-);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */
All of our coffee is purchased through transparent and quality-driven specialty coffee importers. While we do not adhere to purchasing “fair trade," all of our offerings are fairly traded. We always pay  to  times the “fair trade” price, often substantially more.
We consciously source our coffee based on cup quality, environmental stewardship, and traceability. Some of the coffee we purchase is organically certified, but not all of it. Similar to vegetable farmers in the US, coffee growers cannot call their product organic without paying the certification fee. Depending on the size of the cooperative/farm, this may not be a feasible expenditure.
This is our way of differentiating the taste profile of our customers' favorite coffees. Comfort is smooth and creamy while Adventure is juicy and vibrant. On our Coffees page, you can read more about the individual flavors found in each type we offer. And of course, you can easily change which bags you receive from week to week to try them all.
Send us an email at [emailprotected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='x'+a.substr(,)|,n=;a.length-n;n+=)e+='%'+(''+('x'+a.substr(n,)^r).toString()).slice(-);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ and we will get back to you shortly!
Ken’s coffee journey began in  as Scott Rao’s head roaster and lead barista.  Since then he has kept busy owning and operating multiple businesses in the coffee space. Ken thrives on witnessing that “aha” moment, when people realize how amazing coffee can be. He's also quite proud that one of his youngest daughter's first words was "barista.”
Patrick’s palette is like a unicorn: Most people don’t think it exists, but it does and it is awesome.  After several years of experimenting with different brew methods, Pat founded Western Woods Coffee, with a mission to bring premium coffee to farmers markets and special events. Three years, thousands of cups, and a Q Grader certification later, he has become a true ambassador of excellent coffee.
Ella is a taskmaster whose hobbies include setting bars wicked high, whipping Ken and Pat into shape, and eating nails for breakfast.  She’s trilingual (English, Spanish and German), has a BFA from Sarah Lawrence College, and when she’s not working with us, has been known to serve on the boards of non-profits, work with the EPA, run a CSA, and work on documentary films. She is committed to quality in everything she does and in general, runs a tight ship.

The production of exceptional coffees is a collaborative, meticulous and multi-faceted effort. All coffees are sourced in freshly harvested lots through direct relationships with producers and cooperatives committed to quality and sustainable business practices. We travel to origin throughout the year, exploring new coffee sources, checking in with cherished producers, and offering premiums for quality. The long-standing partnerships we nurture are built upon trust—trust that our producers will convey to us what they need to thrive and trust that we will do everything we can to support them. Visit Our Company page to learn more about our sourcing practices.
We work to bring forth the unique flavors from each farm or cooperative to your cup in the most humble, efficient, and honorable way possible. We achieve this by taking meticulous care throughout the roasting process. Practicing smaller production methods and sensory roasting allow us to find the best expressions for each coffee. Using our eyes, ears, nose, and most importantly our taste buds, we evaluate our coffees on a regular basis to ensure we are showcasing the very best attributes of each.
For a coffee to be certified organic by the USDA, strict regulations and certifications are enforced at all levels of production. As the farms we partner with don’t always possess the financial resources to gain these certifications, we don’t require our coffees to be USDA Organic or Fair Trade Certified. However, most of the farms we work with practice organic and ecologically conscious growing methods. Through direct trade, we are able to offer producers substantially higher prices for their coffee.
All coffees have a shelf life, and should ideally be served within fourteen days of the roast date. Coffee will taste best when ground immediately before brewing. Grind only the amount of coffee you plan to brew and store the remainder in an airtight container, away from direct sunlight, heat, and sources of humidity. Avoid putting your coffee in the refrigerator or freezer.  
Because coffee is a seasonal fruit, we source it from origin in tiny, freshly harvested lots. Harvest cycles happen throughout the year, with coffees from different regions landing at different times. Once a shipment arrives stateside, we have a few months to roast and serve the coffee. As a result, you will rarely see a particular single origin coffee on our menu for more than a few months at a time as we will only serve coffees at their finest and freshest. We work to curate a very special coffee experience for you, both in our coffee bars and when you’re brewing our beans at home. If you would like help choosing a coffee, please contact info@sightglasscoffee.com and we can provide some recommendations.
You can use any coffee with any brew method, although some sing better than others when made with different brewing devices. In general, brew methods will either highlight the flavor clarity of a coffee or highlight the body and mouthfeel. For example, a french press, because it has a metal filter, allows oils and insoluble components to enter your final cup of coffee, which enhances the coffee’s overall body. A Chemex, because of its thick paper filter, catches a lot of those insoluble components and emphasizes clarity. At our cafes, we brew all coffees through a V or Fetco as we feel that gives us a balanced representation of each coffee without favoring one aspect of its flavor profile. If you want to have fun and experiment, for coffees that are complex and have lots of delicate flavors, like most East African coffees, try a brewer with a paper filter. For coffees with a noteworthy heaviness and mouthfeel, like Central and South American coffees, try a full-immersion brewing method.
Our coffees are served at a variety of wonderful cafes, restaurants, and other establishments throughout the country (and internationally!). You can also purchase many of our offerings, including seasonal single origin favorites and year-round staples, in our webstore.

    Sightglass is an independent, sibling-owned coffee company in San Francisco.

Coffee is a seasonal fruit and we source it directly from origin in freshly harvested lots. We practice small production methods that allow us to scrutinize and perfect our processes. Attaining a perfect roast is an intuition, a smell, a sound, a slight change in color— it’s about careful attention to detail that comes through in every cup. 
Our company takes its name from the sightglass, the viewing window on our vintage PROBAT coffee roaster that exposes the complex and delicate process of roasting coffee. We believe that knowing the story behind your coffee—where it was grown, how it was processed, and who handled it along the way—is a powerful link from the cup to the wider world. 
Ultimately, we aim to deliver the highest quality achievable in all aspects of our business, whether that be sourcing the most beautiful and wondrous coffees attainable or employing the most mindful and quality-focused practices possible. 
Sourcing green coffee is at the heart of what we do at Sightglass. It is meticulous and essential work. Processing methods, varieties, growing altitudes, climate, soil and farm conditions are a few of the many factors that shape and determine a coffee’s overall quality. Being present at origin allows us to see these factors first hand and ultimately, helps us determine the best expression of each coffee we work with.
Roasting is the transformation of green coffee from a raw product into something that will be consumed. We view roasting as one piece of the larger collaboration between our farmers, sourcing partners, and finally baristas and home brewers. Our objective as a coffee roasting company is to recognize the intentions of the people who have contributed to producing our coffees and express these intentions through our work.
Sightglass began as an aspiration to source, produce, and share distinctive, quality-focused coffees.
In , we began with a small, rickety service-cart in San Francisco’s SoMa district. Equipped with a few Chemex pots and a leaky vintage -group espresso machine, we served coffee to the neighborhood just behind a roll-up garage door housed in a sturdy  built warehouse. People came to visit us, and remarkably, even came back to taste more. Two years and many coffees later, the entirety of this warehouse would become our production roastery, a dynamic & unconventional coffee bar, a community gathering space, and our company headquarters.
Today, our company still operates out of this location, and weve grown a bit, in large part due to our dedicated supporters and steadfast coffee producers. We’ve evolved to comprise a nexus of distinctive shops, an incredibly dedicated, talented and unwavering staff, and an unparalleled network of partners within our wholesale program, whom entrust us to supply their establishments with dazzling coffees.

Lush flavors of pear preserves and lychee meet aromatic notes of pipe tobacco in this syrupy sweet and balanced cup. 
The AAK Brothers coop is a collaboration of three different coops in the Eastern and Western highlands of Papua New Guinea: Apo from the East, then Angra and Kange from the West. Each of these names means “brother” in their respective local languages. By joining forces, these three coops are not only making coffee production and processing easier, they have created a very unique flavor profile, bringing foundation and body from the West and the lighter top end from the East. Recently, the AAK Coop has been able to set up three washing stations in key areas for members to use, and has grown their arsenal of + small stations that offer technical assistance and agricultural education for members to continually cultivate better harvesting practices. All of these aspects combined make for an expressively transparent and unique cup that is unmatched in the vast majority of Indonesia.

Notes of dark chocolate and brown sugar meet rich undertones of vanilla and maple.
Banner Dark is a crowd pleaser, as delicious brewed using a French Press as it is using a traditional drip/filter method. While the components change, this blend perpetually showcases a heavy body and a sweet, lasting finish with low acidity in the cup.
At Sightglass, our goal is to provide a wide spectrum of offerings, each displaying a unique range of characteristics in the cup. Banner Dark represents our deepest roast profile, ideal for those who enjoy denser, richer flavors in their coffee. The coffees sourced for this blend are chosen for their deep sweetnesses and full bodies, attributes which respond beautifully to a more thorough roast, without compromising the nuanced flavors of each.

A full-immersion brewing device with the cleaner profile of paper filter brewing, resulting in a full, evenly extracted cup.
Unlike other full immersion brewing devices, the Clever uses a paper filter, resulting in a immensely clean and radiant cup of coffee. Aptly named, this brewer is clever for the reason that it has a stop-plug to control the duration of steeping time. When placed atop a mug, the plug is released, decanting your freshly-brewed coffee into a mug of choice. Use with Filtropa or Melitta # filters.

Our take on an age-old treat quenches thirst, cleanses the palate and is immensely refreshing incorporated into your favorite cocktail or soda!
Shrubs are a delicious relic from colonial times, when fruit was preserved in an intriguing blend of sugar, vinegar, and aromatics. The resulting syrup or ‘shrub’ captures the deep sweetness of fruit harmoniously balanced by the tangy acidity of vinegar. On a recent sourcing trip to Costa Rica, we came across a stunning lot of ‘cascara,’ the cherry-like fruit surrounding the coffee seed or ‘bean.’ In lieu of discarding the intensely sweet, floral and elegant fruit (often treated as a byproduct of coffee production), we sought to share it. The result is our Coffee Cascara Shrub, produced in thoughtful collaboration with our friends at Berkeley-based, Shrub & Co.

A rose hip aroma, flavors of chocolate wafer, nutella, and sun dried stone fruits, with a soft, juicy satsuma acidity.
A Sightglass favorite, Yetatebe has been decaffeinated through a % chemical-free decaffeination process developed by the industry leaders at Swiss Water in Vancouver, BC. Green beans are soaked in near boiling water, extracting the flavor oils and caffeine from the coffee. The water is separated into a tank where it is forced through activated charcoal filters and stirred around in hot water to remove the caffeine. The coffee beans are then returned to reabsorb the remaining liquid and flavor. Swiss Water Process removes .% of the caffeine in the coffee while retaining the coffee’s unique flavor.

Complex and vibrant, showcasing flavors of honey and black currant, with a clean citrus acidity and a lingering green grape finish.
Maximino Gutierrez owns and operates Finca Las Florestales, a beautiful farm situated deep in the mountains of Herrera, Tolima. He cultivates % Caturra trees on his land, and has been investing in upgrading his equipment year after year. This constant drive to work with his coffee with more respect and care makes his coffee one of the most special in the world. Finca Las Florestales is one of Sightglass’ favorite coffees, and we are excited to share Maximino’s coffee with you.
Since our first visit in , Colombia remains one of our favorite countries to visit and source coffee from. We’ve cultivated some of our dearest producer relationships here, and are consistently blown away by the tremendous quality of coffees and people we’ve encountered in this ruggedly gorgeous country. 
Maximino Gutierrez was one of the first producers we were fortunate enough to work with, and has remained one of our most cherished producers and friends. He produces some of the most exceptional Colombian coffees we’ve tasted on his small, but immaculate Finca Las Florestales, a multi-generational family farm owned and operated by Maximino alongside his brothers and sons. Together, they grow % Caturra variety on their adjacent farms, at altitudes ranging from - masl in the Herrera region of Tolima. The trek to his farm (and export of coffees from it) is no small undertaking as it’s tucked away deep in the mountains of Herrera. We remember first stepping foot on his farm - the sky was the most piercing shade of blue, birds were chirping, all was peaceful. The landscape here lush and rugged, punctuated by heavily forested mountains and vibrant, sweet-smelling flowers - the farm’s namesake.
Like most of Colombias small production farmers, Maximino wet-processes his coffees, using a cherry depulper to remove the fruit from the seed, and then fermenting the coffee overnight. When we first met Maximo, coffees were spread out to dry on the top of his house. Coffees are now dried on impressive drying beds adjacent to his home – just one example of the great care and investment Maximino has employed in enhancing his equipment and production methods.
Each trip to visit Finca Florestales, Maximino and his family is a reaffirming experience. We couldn’t feel more fortunate to do the work that we love with the beautiful people across the world we share it with.

Approachable yet complex, with notes of chocolate-covered orange and lush, tropical fruits.
The synthesis of two coffees from regions known for vibrant flavors, Jerboa’s Jump is the exclusive espresso blend of our th Street coffee bar and roastery in San Francisco.
While sourcing green coffee from all over the world, we’ve often come across very small lots of truly gorgeous coffees that, if we had a venue for them, we would love to purchase and work with. th Street gave us that venue.
We source small lots specifically for th Street, roasted in Stargazer, our beautiful  -kilo Probat roaster. These are featured as single origin drip coffees on our pour-over bar, as well as the components in Jerboa’s Jump.
The Jerboa’s Jump blend comprises two remarkable stand-alone single origin coffees, one from East Africa and one from Latin America. The coffees we source from these regions tend to be big in flavor, juiciness, clarity, with clean texture and a lasting finish. While Jerboa’s Jump isn’t built on the classic Italian espresso model, the flavors work together harmoniously. Approachable, yet refined and complex, you’ll find flavors of chocolate-covered orange and lush, tropical fruits that elegantly and effortlessly pair with milk. If you’re in San Francisco, stop in to our th Street location and let our baristas pull you a shot of this tremendous espresso.

A softly elegant coffee, with flavors of earl grey, peach, and whipping cream.
Sightglass is proud to be roasting coffee from the Kageyo Coop Station for the third year in a row. Many of the members who deliver cherry to the station are also part owners and all share the responsibilities of running the station. Kageyo is situated a bit higher in elevation, nestled in the mountains of the Ngororero District, where this subtle change in elevation from farm to washing station yields a coffee with much more sweetness and complexity than its lower elevation neighbors.

A deep, honey-like body, with notes of ripe berry, chocolate-covered cherry, and sweet candied lemon.
While components and flavors change seasonally, our flagship Owls Howl Espresso invariably delivers a balanced, and refined espresso experience.
It’s simple: excellent coffee depends on the quality and freshness of green coffee. Like any other fresh crop, coffee eventually stales, losing vibrancy, complexity and sweetness. At Sightglass, we strive to offer only the best coffees possible, taking great care to exclusively buy and work with coffees within their current crop. Essentially, we source, roast, and sell our coffees while they exhibit their maximum expression — before they begin to show any loss of character from aging.
Our enduring commitment to these sourcing practices is exemplified by our seasonally rotating Owl’s Howl Espresso blend. We rotate the components that comprise this blend throughout the year to ensure optimal freshness. This gives us the opportunity to showcase beautiful coffees that pair well together in an espresso blend.

The ROK Coffee Grinder is a refined and functional tool, designed to help you achieve a precise and effortless manual grind for any brew style.
Requiring less than half the revolutions of a standard manual grinder, the ROK Coffee Grinder is quick, efficient and immensely easy to use, due in large part to the long handle, stable base and bevel gears with self-lubricating properties. While we love a quality electric grinder as much as the next brewer, there’s something to be said about employing a little elbow grease to achieve a precise grind, and with the ROK, doing so in about the same amount of time! It only takes about  seconds to grind the amount of coffee needed for a double shot of espresso. With a sleek design to boot, this grinder has got it all!

Form meets function in the peerless design of these tampers handcrafted for us by Reg Barber.
Each tamper that leaves Reg Barber’s workshop in British Columbia, Canada is meticulously crafted by hand. While fresh beans and a quality grind are essential to preparing a delicious espresso, a righteous tool for tamping can make a world of difference in the quality of extraction. We use these tampers in both shops and are consistently impressed with how evenly the ground coffee is compressed in the espresso basket. Each one has been thoughtfully designed for comfort and repeated use and we couldn’t be more pleased with the result.

These guides serve as a good place to start. The grinder you use, coffee you choose, and yes, even the water from your sink, can alter the taste in the cup. Every machine is different, so youll want to think of these parameters more as guidelines than law. Play around with your brewer and parameters to get each coffee to taste just how you like it.
We start with the highest quality coffee, cold brew it without heat for over  hours, then use a double filtration process to procure the end result: a complex, smooth and full-bodied brew with low-acid and a chocolate finish. Feelings of invincibility and euphoria are likely to follow.
You don't do dairy. Say no more. We've mixed our life-affirming Cold Brew with the finest coconut cream from Sumatra, Indonesia for a dairy-free, vegan game changer. Coconut Cold Brew is made with three natural ingredients so separation is bound to happen. For a good time, shake it like you mean it.
Our cascading and creamy Nitro Cold Brew is now available in a pop top. Pour it like you mean it into a glass or drink it straight from the source.
We bottled up our Original Cold Brew so it’s ready to go wherever you are. Enjoy straight out of the bottle or pour over ice. Cheers!
Weve heightened the indulgence of drinking milk out of the carton by spiking it with our smooth and bright Cold Brew Coffee!  Try the Original or pick up our newest delight, Chocolate.
Our bright and bold Cold Brew Coffee straight from the tap. Bottoms up!
Cold brewing brings out some of the brightest and sweetest flavor notes of each coffee. We are excited to feature a rotating cast of our single origin coffees that really shine through this brew method.
Nitro Cold Brew is cascading and creamy with all of the giddyup of our original Cold Brew Coffee and a smooth nitro-draft mouthfeel.

              You
              can
              take it with you! We offer growlers for purchase to fill up with your favorite Cold Brew on draft in all of our cafes. Haul it home or to the work fridge for a lift whenever you like.
            
When you become part of the Stumptown wholesale family, you get all of us standing in support of you, working for you.
You can find our coffee in independent cafes, restaurants and grocery stores across the country.  Let us know where you are, and we"ll help you find your local coffee fix.

      “Every Stumptown employee is a steward of that single coffee cherry, from the time it gets picked until the time it ends up in your cup. Stumptown is an energy and a vibe and a culture, but it all ultimately revolves around amazing, incredible coffee.”

      
        —Skip Colombo, Partnerships & Sales
      

We work hard. We make lots of jokes. We cheers beers, ride bikes together, go to shows and trade dogsitting favors. We have tremendous amounts of respect for each other and for what we do. Stumptown is a family on an elemental level. Many of us are artists, musicians, creative types, and passionate types. It helps our coffee taste better and it makes our work lives richer.
And we drink the best office coffee on the planet.  
Some of us came because we were regulars. The baristas knew our drinks and were having a whole helluva lot more fun than the jobs we had. Some came because of the coffee. Some of us were home roasters, or worked for other coffee companies across the country. Came for a chance to work with the best green coffee in the world.
Some came because our best friends worked here. Most became best friends with our coworkers, because they also happened to be some of the best, most interesting people around.
We all came because we wanted to be here. A grip of us have been here for over a decade. We’ve outgrown our first employee holiday dinners, squeezed in the backroom of a cozy Italian family restaurant in Southeast Portland. We’ve leapt across the country. Went Dutch for a summer. But our holiday parties still rage.
We are passionate group of folks, some might even say obsessive. No matter which team we’re on, we’re sourcing, roasting, tasting, testing, practicing and pushing ourselves to do it better.

          We know we are the last link of a long chain, stretching across the earth, made up of hundreds of people and years of toil, soil and sweat to get this coffee into our hands. We take that responsibility very seriously. And we also have a lot of fun.
        
Our tight knit production crew takes pride in scooping, hand-carding, and folding every bag before we send it out into the world, whether it’s headed to a favorite cafe, restaurant, grocery store, or your doorstep.  Our Cold Brew production team brews, bottles and delivers everyone’s favorite pick-me-up. Look out for these guys on the road–they are hauling precious cargo. 
Stumptown runs on creative energy (and coffee, obviously) and the Creative and Marketing team helps us wrangle it. Our in-house team is responsible for everything from illustrations on mugs and packaging design, to signage, communications, and throwing rad events with our friends and partners. If you ever see weird drawings, gifs, or photoshopped snaps of Ozzy Osbourne holding a Cold Brew stubbie, that’s all them.
Our cafes are our living rooms, where we strive to let our coffee shine to its full potential. Our baristas spend months learning how to pull the most pristine shot of Hair Bender espresso, and even longer taming the steam wand to master the art of pouring a perfect latte. We undergo continuous education and attend regular tastings, understanding the full spectrum of our coffee menu so we can help you pick out a coffee you’re going to love.  
We’ve got a team of talented folks who do much more than bean-counting. We rely on them for all the heavy lifting behind the scenes to keep the business running smoothly, and create efficient systems to support our day-to-day operations and growth. They are also the wi-fi wizards and keepers of the candy drawer, so they are super important in lots of ways. 
Our Coffee Sourcing team travels to the ends of the earth to establish long term and sustainable relationships with incredible coffee producers. These folks work on the ground with producers so that the coffee quality can continue to improve year after year. Our Quality Control, Quality Assurance and Roasting teams take it from there, ensuring that the integrity of that amazing coffee shines through once it lands in our hands.
We count ourselves grateful that Stumptown is served in some of the best neighborhood cafes, restaurants and grocery stores across the country. Our partnerships are based on building customized coffee programs and solid relationships. We offer up much more than what’s in the cup. We’re only successful if our partners are, and our sales and support teams go above and beyond to make that happen.  
Even though we have big love for the lo-fi days gone by, we’re lit up by the future in our digital realm. Our web team embodies Stumptown’s bright spirit of innovation and strives to offer the best and warmest online experience possible.
By the time our coffee reaches the hopper or the Chemex, it has traveled far and wide and been through a long journey. Our adept coffee educators make sure we continue to best represent and elevate the experience of drinking Stumptown coffee in our cafes, and in the kitchens and cafes of our wholesale partners. Our service team of espresso techs is on-call -hours a day, in case a machine goes haywire at  am on a Saturday. 

      “If it weren’t for the employees at Stumptown, there wouldn’t be a Stumptown. We understand hard work; that if something is going to be special, we’ve got to go outside the lines and outside the box.”

      
        —Duane Sorenson, Founder

        Coffee is about pleasure. It’s that moment when your hand is warmed by the mug, you bring it up to your nose, inhale deeply and then take a sip.
      

        That sip is the culmination of years of work, three-thousand mile journeys, and passion. Here is how we make that sip perfect.
      

        While you are holding that cup of coffee, close your eyes. Open your mouth slightly. Breathe in deeply through your nose.
      

        You are smelling the most complex thing humans consume. When people talk about the flavors of coffee — notes of orange, or hints of clove — it’s because those organic molecules are contained in the coffee bean. If a coffee reminds you of apple pie, it's because coffee shares some of the same components as food, like lactic and malic acid.
      

        Inside that small bean are the same natural components that make flowers smell so lovely, the same ethers that let you know when a piece of fruit is ripe. Coffee has twice as much going on, molecularly speaking, as red wine.
      

        When tasting coffee, try waiting for it to cool down a little — you’ll be able to taste (and smell) the most when it’s the same temperature as your body.
      

        Flavor only matters in the context of you. What do you like? What does this scent remind you of? Are you looking for a full-bodied cowboy co
        ffee, or a delicate, tea-like finish? Chocolate aromas, or hints of jasmine?

        Don’t worry if you can’t describe it precisely, or have a different perception than someone else. Even when you can’t put it into words, you’ll know what you like.
      

        You experience the full flavors of the coffee bean if and only if nothing has gone wrong during…
      

        Someone stands by that roaster, all day, a person who knows exactly how to bring the best out of every bean — that ideal ratio of sweetness to acidity, that balance — because he or she has been doing this for years.
      

        Again and again, they repeat the same motion: pull a tiny sample of the beans. Stare at them, looking for the tiny signs of perfection. Smell them deeply. Put them back. Pull out some more beans. Stare. Smell. Five seconds later, repeat the process in a meditation that last hours. Do that hundreds of times a day. Do that every day for years.
      

        Know every bean on a personal level. Adjust times and temperatures throughout the day, knowing that  seconds could make the difference between letting this bean shine and overwhelming it. Know that in the morning, the roaster is cold. Know that in the evening it’s hot, and you should probably shave  seconds off that roast.
      

        Roast just enough to bring out the best and full potential of what’s inherent in each particular coffee already. Roast to draw out things like acidity, floral notes, chocolate, molasses, and earth. All of the coffee’s flavor potentials are presented at the first crack – an audible signal that happens at a particular point when roasting coffee. After that, roast just enough to add the right amount of body and sweetness, without degradation.
      

        Roasting different coffees as though they’re the same? Not going to work. Roasting for color, not taste? Never this.
      

        Please don’t burn those beans. They’ve been through so much. They’ve come all the way across the world.
      

        The best coffee grows in the most remote places. There is a thin band that goes around the world near the equator. Within that band, you need mountains, thick old-growth forest and just the right microclimate. Set aside up to four days to get there.
      

        On your way there, you’ll pass through Houston’s H.W. Bush Intercontinental Airport, or you’ll stand in the endless security line at New York’s JFK en route to distant parts of Ethiopia, Colombia, Indonesia and  other countries around the world.
      

        You’ll also experience  vaccines (the malaria pills—which can cause hallucinations and nightmares—are the worst), a passport that fills up with handwritten visas, bumpy eight-hour van rides, granola bars and in at least one case, eating the heart of a bull that has been slaughtered in your honor.
      

        The Green Team members, named for the color of coffee beans before they are roasted, don’t do it the easy way, which would be buying bulk, mid-quality beans at a trading floor in a capital city. Instead, they go right to the source of the best coffee — that farm or washing station high atop a distant Ethiopian hill. It ends when they arrive at that distant farm, washing station, factory or mill. They sit down in a home or around a campfire to talk about this year’s crop with a producer they have met many times. They get to work.
      

          In Colombia, if you go to four farms you will get four bowls of sancocho, which is this soup with chicken, yucca, plantains, potatoes, corn, avocado. Basically, it’s as many calories as you can cram in a bowl.”
        

        The Green Team visits every producer as often as possible, sometimes up to three times per year. They constantly roast and taste the coffee, and they form long-term, lasting partnerships with the producers. They’ll help them implement a new farming technique that could lead to even better coffee. Or they’ll teach a seminar on a new way to process coffee cherry, which is the fruit of the coffee tree surrounding the seed or bean.
      

        They routinely pay producers up to four times what they could get for their crop on the commodity market, but in return, they ask for a lot more work—hand picking each cherry at ideal ripeness, or implementing a new piece of equipment.
      

        The Green Team also identifies potential future producers—maybe this side of the mountain has just the right climate, but the quality level isn’t there yet. Stumptown will invest in that farm, or mill, or factory if that producer is willing put forth effort to get the beans to the level the Green Team looks for. It’s a partnership, and there is prestige and pride involved. For a producer, selling to Stumptown means something.
      

        Above all, they want to help farms become sustainable and to set up strong businesses that build up their communities and produce the highest-quality coffee possible year after year.
      

          Our partners are much more than farmers, they are coffee production experts, constantly innovating practices in planting, harvesting and processing the best coffees around.”
        

        We don’t buy in bulk on a trading floor. We buy directly from the people who are making the coffee. It’s not a transaction; it’s a partnership. If someone is growing the quality of coffee we’re interested in, then we will help them in any way we can. That means regular visits (even though that trip can take up to four days), implementing new techniques and equipment, and forming long-term partnerships.
      

        We shoot for sustainability, and not just in the environmental sense. A sustainable coffee producer is someone who is paid fairly for their incredible work and who can in turn encourage others to follow in their footsteps. A sustainable producer innovates, develops and improves cultivation and in turn can fetch even higher prices from Stumptown. The more each side of the partnership puts in, the better the coffee gets.
      

        We don’t call them farmers, we call them producers, which gives credit to the fact that they are production experts. They are the ones who make this coffee great. They are the ones who are like-minded, who will go the extra mile for quality, whatever that means.

          Producers are the heart of what makes great coffee.
        

          Their skills, expertise and craftsmanship is the difference between mediocre coffee and coffee that is like nothing you’ve ever tasted before. The coffee will never get any better in quality once it lands in our hands, after all. We rely on the producers for that pristine bean. A good roaster works tirelessly to preserve that coffee’s inherent greatness.
        

          The producers grow the coffee trees. They pick the cherry when it is perfectly ripe. They remove the outer fruit, leaving just the bean covered in a thin parchment. They rest the beans, let the beans develop into their full selves.
        

          Everyone on this page does something slightly different — he may tend a small patch of coffee trees on the farm he inherited from his grandmother; she may oversee the cherry soaking in a big tank of water, fermenting at just the right rate.
        

          They live on four continents. They speak at least  different languages. Some use traditional methods that are centuries old; some have taken out four-year loans to get that new top-of-the-line piece of equipment that will lead to a greater, cleaner cup.
        

          It’s not the easy way. It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way, and it creates the best coffee possible.
        

        Coffee is a tree, and you probably prefer one branch to another, even if you don't know it yet.
      

        There isn’t one kind of coffee, there’s a coffee family tree.   For hundreds of years, humans have been cultivating, hybridizing and perfecting it, and today there are hundreds of types, or varieties.
      

        The variety of coffee tree matters—or at least, it usually does. Just as different types of grapes yield different wines, the variety of th
        e bean can have a profound impact on the finished cup. 

        There are hundreds of varieties, and we’ve chosen roughly a dozen that we find truly special. But here are the first ones you should know.
      

          So sweet, so complex and so delicate, this is the pinot noir of coffee. The plants are fragile and don’t produce as much cherry as some other varieties, but they’re worth the effort. A cup of Bourbon-type variety is lush and classic. It’s the coffee of coffee. It charms the snob and the rookie alike. And no, it has nothing to do with the delicious brown adult beverage, though we at Stumptown are big fans of that kind of bourbon, too.

          This is an offshoot of of the Typica family, which is delicate, floral, at times even citrusy. This variety was brought to Indonesia in the late s by Dutch traders. We love it for its nuances and high, fine acidity. Villalobos in particular brings strong flavors of stone fruits like apricots, peaches and plums.
        

          The beauty of these is in their mystery. They are the wildflower varieties, descended from the natural coffee forests of southwestern Ethiopia. Each village has its own variety, handed down over centuries and shaped by the soil, elevation and weather.
        

Related: All of them, really but these in particular: Typica, Gesha


          Think of Gesha as coffee from an alternate dimension. It's like a Szechuan peppercorn, or the Sun Ra Arkestra, complex and otherworldly. It’s as far as it could be from diner coffee, a delicate, black-tea body, with a zest of bergamot. Gesha is picky—it will only grow when, where and how it wants, in tiny microclimates. But whether you grow it in Indonesia or the Americas, it is always thoroughly itself.
        

        Which, finally, brings us to the very beginnings of coffee…
      

        Ten thousand years ago, the Coffea trees grew wild and tangly on the mountain slopes of southwestern Ethiopia.
      

        There, you can still find people performing traditional coffee ceremonies many times a day—one woman will prepare it for the circle of her friends and family who stand around her. She roasts it in a pan, grinds it, pours hot water over it, serves it in the predetermined social order.
      

        The Dutch traders, enamored of this tradition, brought cuttings of the plants to Indonesia. French missionaries, who also saw the beauty in this hot, euphoric brew, spread it throughout Africa and across the sea to the Americas.
      

        Today, coffee trees are cultivated in every hemisphere on four continents. In  countries, you will find those shrubs and their cherry. You’ll also find find the farmers who tend them, the pickers who select them, the processors who obsessively convert fruit to bean. You’ll find the roasters who delicately transform them, and you’ll find the coffee drinkers.
      

        You’ll find the earliest riser in the backpacking crew that stokes the fire and sets the water on to boil. You’ll find the barista who pulls the first shot of the morning for the go-getter. You’ll find the group of -year-old men in the diner at  a.m., spending hours discussing the issues of the day over their bottomless cups.
      

          Drinking coffee is a pleasure. Coffee drinking is fun, and it feels good, and every once in awhile I remember that we’re actually cultivating pleasure. Why do you put anything in your mouth? Because it’s delicious.”
        

        Everything that came before—the shrubs, the farmer, the journey across the sea, the hybrids and the mutations—is for this moment. Because the only thing required for the smallest, quietest and most personal of coffee ceremonies are some good beans and a way to brew.
      

        You’ll hold that mug possessively. You’ll inhale deeply. And then you drink.
