Our coffee is decaffeinated at the Descafecol plant in Manizales, Colombia by using a specialized "combination procedure" utilizing water and ethyl acetate derived from sugar cane molasses. Ethyl acetate is an ester that is found naturally in several fruits and vegetables and Manizales is known for its many sugar cane plantations, making great use of a local product. Ethyl acetate's low boiling point enables a gentle caffeine extraction from the coffee bean, while pressure or excessive heat treatment are avoided and the natural structure of the green coffee bean cells are retained.

Swiss Water Process involves first soaking the coffee in pure water. The green coffee extract that results is then passed through a carbon filter, specifically engineered to filter out the caffeine molecule. The green coffee extract is then introduced to the coffee but without the caffeine. This process is simple in theory, but impressive to execute, since the coffee has to be dried and preserved in an exacting way to ensure the inherent flavour of the coffee remains relatively unscathed.
Great as both a filter, and an espresso, the cup profile is sweet, and subtle with flavours of cocoa, and caramel.

Coava's guide to brewing with your equipment of choice
We share our tips of the trade along with stories from our travels
When Coava Coffee Roasters began packaging coffee by the kilogram in  our intention was twofold: First: Our roaster has been designed to operate most efficiently by the kilogram. By sticking to the metric system and maintaining strict roast cycles, weve been able to reduce our waste to less than one pound of coffee per week. This careful planning is another way we show respect for the work of the coffee producers we represent. Second: Roasting by the kilogram allows us to package our coffees in  gram increments. Known as the Coava , our retail bags promote freshness, dissuade waste, and divide evenly with most brew methods. It is the perfect quantity for the average coffee drinker.
To show respect for the full chain of quality coffee (sourcing, roasting, preparing) we do not offer any blends. Our coffees carry the names of the co-ops and individual farmers who harvest, process, and prepare them for us. We commit to show honor where honor is due.
We only partner with producers who are mindful of their people, their environment, and their crop. The farms we work with take great care of their coffee from seedling to harvest, through processing and storing, and finally in packaging. It is through these sustainable partnerships that we ensure the longevity of the coffee beans and the final quality in the cup.
We only work with the best importers and exporters. Their transparency, care for the farmers, and quality of transportation and storage of our coffees is absolutely essential. These partners are rarely heralded, but hold our industry together. Once the coffees arrive in Portland we move them directly into our green room. This temperature controlled room combines several proprietary practices and ensures that all of the work done before us is kept intact.
Our brew bar is the tasting room to our roastery.
It is a place to experience our craft and hospitality in its purest form. Designed around simplicity, we always offer two selections of hand poured coffee and two selections for espresso based drinks. Our pastries are made locally by Little T American Baker.
You can also be sure to find a large selection of our current coffee offerings for sale and a barista who will gladly help find the one for you. When the weather is nice we have outdoor seating and we always provide free wifi.
Our espresso bar is about community. The gorgeous shop expands on the simplicity of Coavas signature menu with direct-trade Cocanu mochas, house-made Madagascar vanilla, and elegant teas from Portland's Jasmine Pearl Tea. We always offer two origins for espresso based drinks alongside our rotating black coffees. Our pastries are crafted locally by the incredible folks at Little T American Baker. We always have fresh bags of our current coffee offerings. Whether for a gift, a special occasion, or just daily drinking, we can help find the one for you.
You can come and enjoy a delicious drink at your own pace, meet a friend, or get some work done.
b: an occupation or trade requiring manual dexterity or artistic skill
Coava travels the world in pursuit of coffees with the highest quality, complexity, and balance. We take an exhaustive hands-on approach to coffee as an agricultural process. Dedicating ourselves to learning about soil conditions, sustainable farming practices, varietal mutations, and plant diseases are only a few of the areas of specialty that have helped us source outstanding coffees.
Each year, we spend months at origin courting the most conscientious coffee producers. We use our resources to build better processing facilities, introduce the best preservation practices, and spotlight individual farmers. We also collaborate with coffee mills to buy a farmers full harvest. This stands in opposition to the common practice of only purchasing parts of the harvest and leaving the farmer with the harder-to-sell remnants. Our rare approach ensures the purchase of an entire farms production at a higher price. We still get the top-tier separations, but weve also found a home for the rest of the coffees with the local coffee mill.
We make these efforts to establish mutually beneficial partnerships with the men and women producing the coffees we adore.
We are committed to the inherent qualities within each unroasted coffee. We strive to compose beautiful roast profiles that highlight the tremendous work that has been performed by the coffee producers each harvest. We never blend coffees and whenever possible we name them after the farmers who grow them. We are constantly tasting, documenting, and reevaluating our profiles to ensure that we enable individual coffees to shine.
After everything has been said and done Coava is rooted in preparing exceptional beverages. Our passion for balanced & sweet espresso, perfect milk drinks, and delicious brewed coffee brings our baristas together as craftsmen. We push for consistent excellence by refining our skills through palate calibration, systematic preparation, and self-critique. This dedication has earned our team many first place honors in the Barista Competitions.
a: given to general and cordial reception of guests
At Coavas core is the desire to share the delicious coffees that we are excited about. We never dreamed that the pursuit of such a simple goal would surround us with all of the incredible people that make up the Coava family. From our shops dedicated regulars to coffee lovers around the globe, we enjoy coffee together. Weve danced and celebrated, barbequed and tinkered, but also dug in deep and supported one another.
In similar fashion we would not be who we are without great partnerships. We problem solve harvest and processing issues alongside farmers. We help coffee shops all over the United States open, build up, and expand their businesses. We raise money and resources alongside non-profits to benefit our community. With these amazing partners Coava has been honored to grow, learn, and succeed.
b: northwest coffee roaster notoriously fueled by good folks and Led Zeppelin
Coava began in Matt Higgins garage in . The veteran barista and roaster bootstrapped the company by repairing motorcycles. His ambitions were to one day roast and prepare coffees that would be exciting for baristas and inviting to everyday drinkers. To do this, Matt knew that sourcing excellent "coava" would have to be the anchor of everything he did.
So he studied agriculture, farm practices, and sustainable business. He learned from everyone that he could and at the first chance he began traveling to the major coffee growing regions. He sought farmers whose careful work was producing quality crops with the type of complexity and balance that many single origin coffees didn't have at the time. His willingness to do what others would not eventually earned him a reputation among coffee producers as a respectful, diligent, and honest man. Those early years were adventurous and difficult, but laid the foundation for the many long-standing partnerships Coava has with farmers today.
With great coffees in hand, Coava began sharing them through a handful of Pacific Northwest coffeehouses. These early believers led the way for Coava to open our brew bar and roastery in southeast Portland in . We are indebted to and thankful for their support on this journey.
#coavainsight: The word Coava was introduced by William Biddulph to the western world in  in The Travels of a Certayne Englishmen in Africa, Asia, etc... Begunne in  and By Some of Them Finished-this Yeere .

Big Trouble offers nutty, caramel flavors people know and love, which may seem easy—and our goal is to make it easy to enjoy in any brewer—but it's actually one of the most challenging for us, because clean, sweet, low-acidity coffees from small-scale farms can be elusive.
Hologram is our update of the classic Mocha Java flavor profile. Fruit-forward and chocolatey coffees combine to create something distinctly complex.
We pay extra attention to decaf because we know people love it solely for its flavor. For Slow Motion, we start with great coffee—from the same farmers we work with for all of our coffees—and decaffeinate it in small batches using chemical-free water processing.

On New Years Day we woke up at Ryan the roasters house. Some people were getting antsy to wade through the rain to a caf or bar or something, but Ryan the roaster wasnt having it. Its nice and warm here, he said.Lets all just take our shirts off, and relax.
Thats how we got the idea for this subscription. We want everyone to stay home, take their shirts off, and relax. We also ship to offices, where you can enjoy all the benefits of our subscription program except for the part about staying home, removing your shirt, and relaxing.
No matter where you are, the single origin subscription gets you a different coffee from a single origin (like a certain farm in Guatemala or co-op in Ethiopia) each delivery. If you are getting more than one bag, each coffee will be different. We choose; you enjoy. The espresso subscription gets you Friendo Blendo unless you get more than one bag, in which case we throw in a single origin espresso with each delivery. We roast; you relax.

For years we dutifully raised them from their little speckled eggs to beautifully plumed adults. We built them bigger and better coops, we trimmed their feathers, fed them only the best feed and taught them everything we knew. Finally, our …
Lets pretendjust for funthat each and every one of us is going to die someday. And lets pretendagain, just for shits and gigglesthat each of us should live this life to the fullest or whatever. What are we going to do? Well, we dont know! Were just a coffee roaster, for crying out loud. Jeez.
But heres what we do know: We try our best not to suck (to not suck?). If we can help a -person co-op in Ethiopia build a schoolhouse, of course well do it. If one of our coworkers needs some time off to care for a sick parent, of course well cover her shifts. If we need to take a red-eye coach flight to Frankfurt to score the perfect  roasting equipment, of course well do it.
And sure, were gonna die someday. Even this stupid Web site will probably be obsolete by next year. But as long as were all together, lets do the best we can to not suck. And lighten up; its only coffee, after all.
Where does great coffee come from? It comes from third-generation farmers and mill-workers in Latin America, Indonesia, and East Africa. And thats where we go to find it, forging relationships that ensure quality of life for our producers, and high-quality coffee for our roastery in San Francisco.
Dont get us wrong; one-night stands are great. When it comes to coffee, however, we prefer long-term relationships. Thats why we spend months of every year on the road, visiting and cooperating with the folks who make it all happen, at the source.
We're old-fashioned... about roasting. We rely on highly trained people, not computers, to see through the intention of our roasting style. Our style highlights the intrinsic qualities of a coffee that drove us to buy it in the first place: cleanness, sweetness, acidity, complexity.
We roast on a hulking beast of a vintage German roasterone that was made to hold consistent heat and let air flow through in simple ways controlled by a human being...just like you.

We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as bakers chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.

The Tolima region, that is home to Maximino, is experiencing a transformationfrom poverty and violence, due to the Colombian conflict, to a rebounding market for their high quality beans, offering a vehicle of change for its people.
In addition to producing fine coffee beans, Maximino is dedicated to nurturing his land and its wildlife. He not only grows sustenance crops such as maize and beans, he has also created a small nature reserve that provides a nesting site for the Colombian chachalaca. This turkey-like, native bird is not endangered but has seen a continual declining population. It is Maximinos commitment to give back to the land that has been so generous to him.
El Diviso is a complex coffee withcinnamon and milk chocolate aromas, mandarin and meyer lemon acidity andsmooth cashew butter undertones.

To drink a cup of Ethiopia Nigusse Lemma is to connect with the origins of coffee. Beans from Ethiopias Limu woreda (district) deliver unique flavors that can only be discovered in heirloom varietals. Located in the southwestern part of country, Limu is not as well known as Yirgacheffe or Harrar, but deserves the attention that it is receiving.
Our Ethiopia Niguisse Lemma is sourced from the family farm of Lemma Edeto and is located in the highest elevations of the Limu region. Shade from old growth trees, water from spring fed stream, and native varietal of coffee that flourish organically are in no better hands than the Edeto Family. Lemma, with over  years in the coffee industry, has passed down the knowledge to his sons Nigusse and Haile, who operate the farm which their father recovered after it was confiscated by the Derg regime in the s. The familys commitment to quality includes a fully natural dry processing that insures no unripend cherries taint the taste of the finished product. Fully control from farming to milling has resulted in award-winning coffee. Nigusse and family were recently honored for the African Taste of the Harvest competition awarded by the African Fine Coffee Association.

My love affair with coffee goes back to my hometown of Salerno, Italy, where as a young man, I worked for the Nestler Coffee Roasting Plant.
The proprietor, a master of coffee roasting, made me his protg. With great generosity and personal pride he taught me all his skills, from bean selection to blending. Most importantly, he taught me his method of roasting with Oak Wood.
When I came to America I discovered there where few places I could get a good espresso. I saw this as an opportunity to implement all my skills in coffee roasting and founded Mr. Espresso in .
I happily bring to America the tradition of wood roasted coffee. I hope you enjoy!
My father, Carlo, was the second youngest of seven brothers and sisters raised by a single mother in the Southern Italian town of Salerno, during World War II and its aftermath.
He married my mother, Marie Francoise, who was from the coastal region of Normandy, France and the daughter of a French baker. They lived in Paris where he began a career in the elevator industry and where my sister Laurence (Laura) and brother John were born. Following in the footsteps of his older brother Franco, he immigrated to the United States, seeking a better life for his family. His brother Franco had studied at CAL Berkeley and openedthe Villanova, one of the first successful Italian restaurants in the East Bay.
Upon his arrival, my father continued his work at Otis Elevators and found a home in Alameda. In  I, the youngest son and the first American of the family, was born.
At that time in the United States, very little was known about espresso, let alone espresso equipment. It would not be inaccurate to say that few Americans had ever even drank an espresso, and even fewer knew the intricacies of how to make one. But as Italian culture began to permeate the Bay Area from epicenters such as San Franciscos North Beach, my father identified the necessity to bridge the gap between my familys past and what is now my familys future: to popularize excellent espresso as imperative to a good meal.
With a strong electrical and mechanical background, he approached his contacts in Italy and purchased a few espresso machines for direct import to our Alameda home. In , with nothing but a brochure in hand and his word, he began selling the espresso equipment to Italian restaurateurs across the Bay Area. As a recent immigrant, he was eager to connect the dots between the rich heritage of our collective history and the ever-increasing demand in San Francisco for Italian culture.
His attempts were successful beyond anything he could have imagined. Although meager by todays standards, my fathers few machines played a crucial role in the Bay Areas appreciation of espresso coffee. Our garage became a showroom and a testing center. Our pickup truck became the delivery truck for installations. My brother John began assisting my father as an apprentice as early as age ten. My sister Laurence (Laura) typed brochures at the kitchen table, and I found myself riding along with my mother to make coffee deliveries to our customers. The family had become, in effect, an importer of Italian culture. Upon visiting our showroom in Oakland, you will still see the original shipping crates with our old home address on them, a constant reminder of the companys roots.
One of the companys earliest clients was Caffe Mediterraneum (or The Med as it is more lovingly referred to by its patrons), the first espresso bar in the East Bay, located in Berkeley, California. Boasting the birthplace of the Caf Latte, barista extraordinaire and owner, Lino, purchased a -group Aurora lever machine (- times the size of the average Espresso Machine!) to use in his already famous caf.
Naturally, the transition to roasting coffee was inevitable. My father had successfully provided the machines. Now he was intent on providing the espresso. Initially though, he just wanted some good coffee to drink at home. His initial roasting experiments in our kitchen had the neighbors convinced our house had caught fire. Despite their puzzlement, one thing was clear: the coffee was superb.
In  he officially began commercial roasting in tiny batches, roasted for a curious few. His combination of high quality espresso machines and Oak Wood roasted coffee caught on quickly. My fathers clients came to know him as Mr. Espresso and, as you would expect, the name stuck.
Up to that time, espresso was primarily considered an ingredient added to a oz glass of steamed milk and it was roasted with primarily one goal, to cut through all that milk. So most of the espresso at that time was roasted very dark, up to the point just before it would catch fire in some cases. My father was one of the first to roast espresso as it was in Italy, as a beverage to be consumed by itself with all the flavor, nuance and complexity of a fine glass of wine.
Mr. Espresso became the roaster of choice for some of the Bay Areas finest cafes and restaurant. Acclaimed chefs such as Alice Waters , Bradley Ogden and Paul Bertolli and distinguished restaurants like Square One and The Baywolf began to take notice. The coffee grew and expanded not only because of its taste, but also because of the story that came with it. At the same time, the story of Mr. Espresso is a reminder of just what it means to be an American. This story is a living example of how our diverse cultural landscape was nourished by the efforts of those eager to share their heritage with the rest of the world.
"The proprietor, a coffee master, made me his protégé. Under his generous guidance, I learned the nuances of making the perfect brew; from bean selection to blending. And the holy grail of his philosophy was his family's method of roasting with aged oak."
Mr. Espresso continues to be the Di Ruocco homestead. Carlo and Marie-Francoise can now easily find that elusive espresso with the depth of flavor and quality of their favorite brews while Laurence, John, Luigi and Alex continue to explore.

Today, Mr Espresso has grown into a Bay Area institution  as a quality roaster and an established provider of espresso equipment, service, and training to a sizable share of coffeehouses and restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.
Mr. Espresso continues to be family-owned and operated with two generations of Di Ruoccos working together in the Oakland showroom and roasting facility to ensure that what we began over  years ago will endure.
Along with the new generation and keeping with the pace of change in our industry, the old world methods we use are evolved through education and experience. A balance of art versus science is now our goal. Our coffee now has a distinctively Italian American profile, maintaining the emphasis on espresso while rounding out our selection with amazing single origins and blends, at a variety of roasts.
We have seen many trends come and go, and to our knowledge, things have a tendency to work in cycles. Without deviating from the things that have contributed to our success over the years, we are always striving and pursuing new ways towards higher quality and a greater diversity of tastes.
We think youll find that Mr. Espresso strikes that wonderful balance between time honored traditional methods and the emerging trends of the marketplace.

We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as bakers chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.

We believe he did just that, and today Mr. Espresso is proud to offer Carlos interpretation of a timeless classic. True to its roots, Neapolitan Espresso is sure to delight the senses whether it is prepared at home with a stove-top Caffettiera Napoletana or expertly crafted at your neighborhood espresso bar.

We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as bakers chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.

The most common source of fuel used to supply a coffee roaster with heat is gas. We are, however, the first and only roaster in the United States to roast coffee beans exclusively over a fire fueled by Oak Wood. The differences are not what one might initially expect. Unlike cooking with a wood oven or grill, where the smoke from the wood imparts a flavor to the final product, the main difference between wood and conventional roasting lies in the quality of the heat delivered to the beans. Heat derived from wood has higher moisture content and is better suited for slow roasting.
The more oil preserved within the bean, the more exquisite the final flavor will be. The natural humidity within the wood seems to envelop the beans during the roasting process, hence preserving more of the lipids within. Meanwhile, the slow roasting aspect ensures the coffee is lower in acidity and higher in body. The result is most apparent in our espresso, yielding more crema, fuller flavor, and a smoother finish. For drip coffee for which we actually wish to retain the acidity of the coffees, we subject the beans to a faster roasting time.
The unique advantages of wood roasting do not come without challenges, as the use of such an inconsistent fuel (i.e. wood) creates difficulties in maintaining consistency between roasts. A nightmare for an inexperienced operator, years of experience of roasting with wood are required to develop the intuition and instinct necessary to master the process. Luckily for us, with  years of wood roasting under our belt, we are able to claim this as an advantage; since through the unpredictable nature of roasting with wood, we are required to be attentive and obsessive with each and every roast: nothing can replace the skilled guidance of our experienced roasters. However, never the ones to be overconfident, we still go through extra steps to ensure consistency and quality.
We begin by selecting well seasoned wood from responsible suppliers. We then utilize thermocouple data collected at key locations on the roaster along with VFD motor control, which allows to make fan and drum speed adjustments during the roasting process. The wood smoke emissions are then abated by high powered afterburners which are in full compliance with local air quality standards. Combining these tools with our years of experience, we are able to maintain control of the roasting process with a very high level of consistency. As you can see, wood roasting is an artisan craft where human experience using old world methods, combined with the latest technological advances in roasting, delicately blend art and science. We hope you will enjoy a distinctive coffee experience which is impossible to duplicate.

Our Colombian El Diviso microlot, comes from producer Maximino Diaz small farm that sits in the Central Andes at a , foot elevation. The Tolima region, that is home to Maximino, is experiencing a transformationfrom poverty and violence, due to the Colombian conflict, to a rebounding market for their high quality beans, offering a vehicle of change for its people.
In addition to producing fine coffee beans, Maximino is dedicated to nurturing his land and its wildlife. He not only grows sustenance crops such as maize and beans, he has also created a small nature reserve that provides a nesting site for the Colombian chachalaca. This turkey-like, native bird is not endangered but has seen a continual declining population. It is Maximinos commitment to give back to the land that has been so generous to him.
El Diviso is a complex coffee withcinnamon and milk chocolate aromas, mandarin and meyer lemon acidity andsmooth cashew butter undertones.

To drink a cup of Ethiopia Nigusse Lemma is to connect with the origins of coffee. Beans from Ethiopias Limu woreda (district) deliver unique flavors that can only be discovered in heirloom varietals. Located in the southwestern part of country, Limu is not as well known as Yirgacheffe or Harrar, but deserves the attention that it is receiving.
Our Ethiopia Niguisse Lemma is sourced from the family farm of Lemma Edeto and is located in the highest elevations of the Limu region. Shade from old growth trees, water from spring fed stream, and native varietal of coffee that flourish organically are in no better hands than the Edeto Family. Lemma, with over  years in the coffee industry, has passed down the knowledge to his sons Nigusse and Haile, who operate the farm which their father recovered after it was confiscated by the Derg regime in the s. The familys commitment to quality includes a fully natural dry processing that insures no unripend cherries taint the taste of the finished product. Fully control from farming to milling has resulted in award-winning coffee. Nigusse and family were recently honored for the African Taste of the Harvest competition awarded by the African Fine Coffee Association.

Our outpost in Williamsburg is where it all began. Drop in seven days a week for a single origin espresso and a fresh bag of coffee.
We open the doors to our roastery every Sunday, transforming our workspace into a tasting room for neighbors and travelers alike.
What began as a pocket square-sized espresso bar in the back of a barbershop is today an emerging coffee roasting company in Brooklyn, New York. At Parlor, we have set out to source and roast coffees with character.
Collectively, we are a small group of professionals and artists who believe that coffee is a beautiful and complex subject within the greater culinary landscape. Our approach is both fastidiously scientific and instinct-driven. Every one of the uniquely sweet coffees that has made its way into a bag bearing our label has been on a laborious journey beginning with the producer at origin and ending in the careful hands of the roaster. It is our tireless goal to consistently seek the best possible expression of each individual coffee.
Coffee is complex: it is the seed of a fruit limited to growth within the tropical belt. We aim to source the finest coffees of the world with honesty and an unwavering drive to reveal their beauty.

We are delighted to be featured on Gear Patrol this month! The folks at Gear Patrol stopped by our tasting room to learn how to brew the perfect Kalita Wave step-by-step.

Weve had the pleasure of working with the Desarrollo producer group in the town of Gigante, Colombia, for a number of years now, so were happy to announce the launch of Los Gigantes Decaf. 
In an effort to create a decaf that matches the caliber of our regular offerings, we pre-selected coffees with a bright and sweet profile before they are sent to be decaffeinated. At the Descafecol plant in Manizales, the caffeine is removed, as though by magic, using naturally occurring Ethyl Acetate derived from sugar cane. You'll find Ethyl Acetate in green coffee as well as various fruits, and it is the most common ester in wine. 
The resulting coffee is intensely sweet and fruited both in aroma and flavor, with notes ofbanana bread, preserved cherries, and chocolate pudding!
Need a quick and thoughtful gift for a host (or just want to treat yourself)? This sweet duo is just the thing:
The Classic Ritual Mug or a Pillarbox Red Falcon Enamelware Mug (let us know in the comments :)
A  oz-bag of the coffee that our head roaster deems worthy of your generous heart!
Our newest coffee from Rwanda comes from the community of Kanyege, located in the southwestern mountains of the country, near Lake Kivu. Bourbon variety coffee cherries are grown on small, privately owned farms before being delivered to the Kanyege washing station. This coffee is an interesting mix of round, comforting flavors underlying a racy fruit acidity. Look for flavors of peach nectar and lemon brisk tea, sitting atop a warm background of hazelnuts and cocoa nibs.
Nyeri County, situated right between the slopes of Mount Kenya and the lush Aberdare National Park, is one of the world's most renowned coffee growing regions. With high altitude, rich volcanic soil, and ample access to fresh clean water, the terroir is perfect for growing great tasting coffees. As is typical in this region, this lot is the product of many small-holder farmers, who work collectively at the Kiamania factory. At the factory, the coffee is carefully fermented, washed and dried on raised beds, with special attention paid to sorting out the absolute best at every stage of the process. The result is a very floral cup of coffee, with clean flavors of raspberry, cherry and lime.
Nelson is an exceptional and unusual coffee producer for the El Cielito region. Hes a trainedagronomist and botanist, and manages his expansive farm in a very professional manner, denselyplanting his Catuai variety trees in manicured rows to maximize production. While we typicallyassociate big production yields with diminished quality, Nelson very carefully monitors his plants,driving up from the village daily in an old Dodge truck to insure they are all healthy and vigorous.
Nicknaming the farm Chely, after his mother, shows a softer side of Nelson that isnt all business,and his sense of humor is as honed and effective as his growing practices. The fruits of all this laborare tremendously sweet, with a light nuanced acidity that has become a hallmark of great coffees fromthis region. Nelson has done much to challenge notions of traditional coffee cultivation, but its hard todisagree with his delicious results.
In the Haight-Ashbury scene of the s, side door became a kind of stand-in term for the transgression of norms in a tumultuous period. It also signified a different way of looking at things, an alternative that, like many, would become suspiciously mainstream. It is in that revolutionary Aquarian spirit we offer you our Spring seasonal espresso blend, Side Door.
In the world of coffee, Brasil has always conjured up the image of body. The coffees that hail from this country are heavy, sweet, and bring the creamy viscosity that are reminiscent of some of the best memories of espresso. The two Brasils featured in this blend are no different.
The first, Ip Rosa, has a sweetness and silkiness like heavy cream with candied chestnuts and Caramelo. And, the second, well this Brasil really changes the game when it comes to the concept of a traditional Brasil coffee. Bulldog, as it is affectionately known, starts off with the mild German chocolate cake notes, and then hits you with the funk of grapefruit peel and hops.
The other half of Side Door is a duo of African coffees, representing the more experimental, bright side of the blend.The Rwandan Cotecaga is always a favorite around here with its foundation of the sweetness of graham cracker and higher notes of grilled watermelon and lime.
Our fourth component, Konyu heads into the mix. Konyu hails from Kenya, and provides a bright fruited melody to the Door, with notes of peach, blood orange, and a silky body. 
This quartet of coffees comes together in the following manner: a fruit-flower accord of watermelon, lime and jasmine on top; a rich and smooth texture like ganache in the middle; and an overwhelmingly cookie-like sweetness. That is to say, its balanced in a way that some other blends can only hope to be. It can be sweet, easygoing, and traditional; yet forward-looking, experimental and far-out - all while staying quintessentially Ritual.

The Souza family has long been part of what we do here at Ritual. For years Joo Souza, affectionately called Ziho amongst his friends and family, had been doing things a bit differently in Brasil. After the devastating 'Black' frost of  and the subsequentskyrocketing of coffee prices all over Brasil, farmers started turning their focus to producing coffee for volume. Ever a man of tradition, Ziho kept producing coffee the way his father taught him, and in turn, passed on his talent and wisdom to his children and grandchildren. Today, his son Bruno works the land in the same way as his father, picking coffee only when at its peak, processing cherries carefully in small batches, and ultimately striving for the best coffee he can produce - not just the most coffee he can produce. This Sweet Tooth offering is a blend of Rubi and Catua cherries dried carefully over - days in the natural method and then milled directly on the farm. The care in producing this spectacular offering comes through with amazing clean and complex flavors - look for notes of ripe peach and apricot brightened with a light orange acidity over a backdrop of syrupy sweet milk chocolate.
As a roaster that is committed to promoting our producers and bringing them out of anonymity, single origin espresso has always been important to us. The best shots of espresso we've ever had have been single origin--dynamic, sweet, and complex. They are balanced, and good in milk to boot.
Throughout the year we will be showcasing eight to twelve single producers in homage to our original Sweet Tooth blend. An anti-blend that explicitly showcased the producers whose coffees comprised it. Sweet Tooth will be a rotating single origin on which we've put our stamp of approval as a great shot of espresso.

The fruits of all this laborare tremendously sweet, with a light nuanced acidity that has become a hallmark of great coffees fromthis region. Nelson has done much to challenge notions of traditional coffee cultivation, but its hard todisagree with his delicious results.
In the Haight-Ashbury scene of the s, side door became a kind of stand-in term for the transgression of norms in a tumultuous period. It also signified a different way of looking at things, an alternative that, like many, would become suspiciously mainstream. It is in that revolutionary Aquarian spirit we offer you our Spring seasonal espresso blend, Side Door.
In the world of coffee, Brasil has always conjured up the image of body. The coffees that hail from this country are heavy, sweet, and bring the creamy viscosity that are reminiscent of some of the best memories of espresso. The two Brasils featured in this blend are no different.
The first, Ip Rosa, has a sweetness and silkiness like heavy cream with candied chestnuts and Caramelo. And, the second, well this Brasil really changes the game when it comes to the concept of a traditional Brasil coffee. Bulldog, as it is affectionately known, starts off with the mild German chocolate cake notes, and then hits you with the funk of grapefruit peel and hops.
The other half of Side Door is a duo of African coffees, representing the more experimental, bright side of the blend.The Rwandan Cotecaga is always a favorite around here with its foundation of the sweetness of graham cracker and higher notes of grilled watermelon and lime.
Our fourth component, Konyu heads into the mix. Konyu hails from Kenya, and provides a bright fruited melody to the Door, with notes of peach, blood orange, and a silky body. 
This quartet of coffees comes together in the following manner: a fruit-flower accord of watermelon, lime and jasmine on top; a rich and smooth texture like ganache in the middle; and an overwhelmingly cookie-like sweetness. That is to say, its balanced in a way that some other blends can only hope to be. It can be sweet, easygoing, and traditional; yet forward-looking, experimental and far-out - all while staying quintessentially Ritual.
Dose: - grams in a "g" VST or "g" Strada basket

The Souza family has long been part of what we do here at Ritual. For years Joo Souza, affectionately called Ziho amongst his friends and family, had been doing things a bit differently in Brasil. After the devastating 'Black' frost of  and the subsequentskyrocketing of coffee prices all over Brasil, farmers started turning their focus to producing coffee for volume. Ever a man of tradition, Ziho kept producing coffee the way his father taught him, and in turn, passed on his talent and wisdom to his children and grandchildren. Today, his son Bruno works the land in the same way as his father, picking coffee only when at its peak, processing cherries carefully in small batches, and ultimately striving for the best coffee he can produce - not just the most coffee he can produce. This Sweet Tooth offering is a blend of Rubi and Catua cherries dried carefully over - days in the natural method and then milled directly on the farm. The care in producing this spectacular offering comes through with amazing clean and complex flavors - look for notes of ripe peach and apricot brightened with a light orange acidity over a backdrop of syrupy sweet milk chocolate.
As a roaster that is committed to promoting our producers and bringing them out of anonymity, single origin espresso has always been important to us. The best shots of espresso we've ever had have been single origin--dynamic, sweet, and complex. They are balanced, and good in milk to boot.
Throughout the year we will be showcasing eight to twelve single producers in homage to our original Sweet Tooth blend. An anti-blend that explicitly showcased the producers whose coffees comprised it. Sweet Tooth will be a rotating single origin on which we've put our stamp of approval as a great shot of espresso.

Creamery is our mainstay blend of seasonal coffees that emphasizes depth and balance in the cup. Great for vibrant, silky espresso and chocolatey, sweet drip.
Current blend is Colombia Robinson Figueroa, Colombia Ignacio Quintero, Ethiopia Birbirsa.
We enjoy our espresso extractions on the longer side to really pull out a lot of the complexity. Try  g in /  g out around  sec and adjust to taste. As filter/drip we typically brew at - g coffee and  ml water using Kalita, Hario or similar pourover style. In this method of prep expect a greater presence of dried fruit notes and a range of chocolate flavors.

We always look forward to the arrival of these coffees, which often happens right around our holiday season. Sulawesi is the only Indonesian coffee we bring in because the processing there more closely resembles that of Central America (as opposed to the earthy notes present in many Sumatran coffees). 
Our Minanga Villages micro lot comes from Toraja Utara and is decadently sweet. Full-bodied coffee with notes of vanilla, nutmeg, dark chocolate, with a lightly crisp citrus acidity. S variety grown at - meters, fully washed.

Due to the inherent inconsistencies of volumetric measurement, using a digital gram scale to measure your dose of coffee and water is ideal. The Bonavita Digital Scaleis designed to deliver consistently precise measurements in . gram increments. Paired with a built in timer, this scale is the perfect tool to ensure a proper brew ratio at home.Dimensions:
Gaharo comprises  farming families, located in the hills above the Bukeye washing station. Bukeye is the first washing station constructed by Ben and Kristy Carlson, an American family who developed the Long Miles Coffee Project, a farmer focused initiative aimed at developing top quality coffees. For Long Miles, Gaharo farmers are neighbors and co-workers  many of them are dedicated washing station employees, and their families call Gaharo home. Gaharo means we are full in Kirundi, the language of Burundi.

We just received a vibrant, fruit-forward lot from the Karongi District of Rwanda. This single-varietal offering was meticulously grown and harvested at many small farms around the co-op and quickly delivered to the washing station. There it was dry fermented for  days, soaked for  hours, then dried on raised beds of shade net. Learn more or grab a bag here.
Our release of Spring  continues a year-long series of exciting seasonal blends. Each of these blends is roasted to be used in either filter or espresso methods. To learn more about this amazing project and how to brew them, head over here.
Join us in our Annapolis roastery workshop every Friday at AM for a lively, informative tasting of what's new and exciting at Ceremony!
We love getting the opportunity to taste new coffees each season. Join us as we explore some new additions to our offering.
Tucked off of West St. in Annapolis, Ceremony's coffeehouse sits just in front of our roastery and offers a leading edge coffee and espresso program.
The possibilities are practically endless when opening a coffee space in our nation's capital. Do you embrace the traditional cafe route, focus on amazing food, or cross-over with another unique business? There are so many potentials in Washington DC, but we decided the best way to serve our community right now is through a space that educates and makes accessible your coffee ritual. Our DC Workshop doesn't have cafe service or food (except at parties!). Rather, it focuses on wholesale + public classes, free weekly coffee breaks, and bringing people together in our vibrant District coffee community!
You can find us at  st St. NW #B in Hamilton Court, which is a small collection of buildings in Georgetown that features a fascinating, coffee-filled past: http://georgetownmetropolitan.com////georgetowns-lost-beatnik-past/
Link up for maps of all our locations: http://ceremonycoffee.com/coffeehouse
Whether you want to attend one of our free Weekly Coffee Breaks, take a wholesale partner class, or a home barista class, we've got you covered! Check out http://ceremonycoffee.com/events for the happenings at each of our locations.
Say hello to Annuals, Ceremony's twist on a seasonal blend series! By offering new, unique blends based on in-season coffees, seasonally appropriate flavors, and fun themes, we intend to engage your palate, mind, and aesthetic eye! 
In the Spring, Summer, and Fall, you can expect us to highlight coffees from the Northern Hemisphere (Meso America, northerly Africa, northerly South Asia and Pacific Islands). In the Fall, Winter, and Spring, the Southern Hemisphere will reign (South America, southerly Africa, southerly South Asia and Pacific Islands). Why blend with freshly harvested coffee? Because it tastes better than that roasted from old green coffee. Once a coffee berry is picked from the tree, the clock is ticking!
Annuals are also about blending to create distinctive seasonal flavor experiences:
Winter - Full-bodied + Balanced - It's not just heartier food we crave in chilly, Hibernal months. Stay warm with this rich, deep, and comforting blend.
Spring - Bright + Sweet - With the world reawakening around us, this lively, elegant blend will rejuvenate your taste buds with light, fresh flavors.
Summer - Sweet + Iced-focused - How do you like your iced coffee? This blend will make a perfectly sweet, full cold cup for those hot, sticky days.
Fall - Progressive Series - Back to school! Learn what a difference blending makes by experiencing all four, unique versions of this experimental project.
Holiday - Berry-forward + Rich - Gather round with family and friends to enjoy this fruity, sweet, and full-bodied blend that will satisfy everyone in your household.
One other quite interesting thing about Annuals. We are roasting these blends in-between our light peak and espresso profiles. You may have noticed that traditionally, all of our single origins and house blends are light roast profiles, while our espressos are medium roast profiles. These roast levels are a big part of what makes us Ceremony. So why change our roasting for Annuals? There are a couple of reasons. The biggest is that we want these blends to be easily brewable as filter and espresso. Through roast profiling and tasting by our QA team, we find the sweet spot in between our two typical roast levels that makes these blends accessible to your pour over dripper or espresso machine. Read on below to see our recommended brewing parameters for this profile. The other big reason for splitting the difference is that we want Annuals to be a blend everyone can get excited about! By developing the coffees just that little bit more, we feel that the added depth and body will offer a wonderful complement to our lighter, cleaner, and more elegant roasts. We hope you agree! 
Since Annuals roasts are slightly more developed, the rule of thumb will be that compared to our light peak roasts, you'll want to brew stronger ratio-wise and grind more coarsely. Compared to our espresso roasts, you'd want to brew Annuals weaker ratio-wise and grind finer. Annuals are basically the middle bowl of porridge, not too hot, not too cold, just right!

Hard to believe it's that time of year again! Though the weather hasn't given us a cold shoulder yet, the leaves are exploding with radiance, as is my family about the season's festivities. Commence with the texting! Though I'm not a big fan of holiday creep (Christmas in July, anyone?), past years of procrastination have left me scrambling. This year, I promised myself that I'll be different, starting with making sure I have the perfect coffee for Thanksgiving (Don't forget the Decaf either! Seriously, our Decaf Colombia is really good!). Thankfully, we're releasing our Holiday Blend  this week, so you and I can check great coffee off our lists nice and early (Did you know most of our coffees taste better with almost a week of rest off-roast?). There will be fresh roasts every week through Christmas, so stop back often to recharge, as we're pretty sure your company will love this full, sweet, satisfying coffee!
To build this two-bean blend, we started with the idea that a holiday coffee should be well-liked by everyone in your house. We also wanted it to pair well with traditional holiday food, drink, and dessert. To do this, we began with our Ethiopia Wazzala Natural - a coffee with a big personality that brings a barrelfull of dark red fruit to the cup. Imagine ripe cranberries followed by a sip of red wine. Of course, every leading character needs a foil to bring out the best in both, so we experimented with blending several different coffees before striking gold with the Honduras Jaguar Land III. Though it sounds more like the latest B-movie blockbuster than delicious coffee, trust us when we say this washed Central just works as a contrast to its fruitier Natural counterpart. Adding a deep, molasses-like sweetness and warming spice aromatics, the Jaguar Land's deeply steady Spock plays the perfect sidekick to the Wazzala's flamboyant Kirk, creating a fuller, more complex, more satisfying cup. 
We wish you and your family a wonderful holiday season!
If you pressed me, I'd probably tell you that I prefer Washed coffees over Natural coffees ninety-nine times out of a hundred. I'm not trying to be a Natural hater. It's just that I enjoy Washed coffees' cleaner flavor (as a result of fewer defects and little-to-no fermentation), sparkling acidity, and engaging mouthfeel more. Every once in a while though, a Natural coffee comes along that tastes clean, berrylicious, but not too fermenty, and just incredibly delightful. Our Ethiopia Wazzala Natural is such a coffee, tasting of strawberry, cherry, and raisins, which is why I'm super excited about this year's version of Asymmetries!
You all know the deal - Asymmetries is a progressive espresso series predicated around two coffees, one washed and one natural. This year, it's the Ethiopia Wazzala Natural as mentioned, and the Ethiopia Beriti Washed. We'll start with a blend of % Wazzala Natural and % Beriti Washed, then subsequently shift the blend % towards the Natural every few weeks.
Why should you try it? Because Ethiopian coffees are some of the best in the world! Also, most cafes serve static blends, which are comforting and consistent, but a progressive blend gives you insight into how blending ratios affect flavor, body, and more. Look for your favorite cafe to carry the entire series so you get to taste the experience! You can also order the series online. Don't have an espresso machine? That's okay! I highly recommend our Asymmetries blends in an immersion dripper, press pot, or other steeping methods.
What to know more about the coffees? Check them out here:
Beriti Washed      -  http://store.ceremonycoffee.com/coffees/beriti.html
                              Character - Crisp, juicy, medium body, silky, citrus
Wazzala Natural  -  http://store.ceremonycoffee.com/coffees/wazzala_natural.html
                              Character - Sweet, creamy, full body, berries & cherries
V, a % to % blend, leads heavy on the Bertiti Washed. Buy a bag here: http://store.ceremonycoffee.com/coffees/asymmetries_v.html 
To get your mouth watering, here's what you can expect to taste in V:
Fresh melon aromatics
Sweet chocolate and blackberry
in a crisp, juicy cup
You can see the Beriti asserting itself in V with the overall experience being on the crisp, juicy side. A hint of the Wazzala Natural sneaks in with the blackberry though! We think this version will make a beautiful espresso, Long Black, or Cortado. As the blend progresses toward the Natural, the body will get fuller, the taste fruitier, and the mouthfeel more mellow. This shift will take any milk drink and imbue it with the taste of berries and cream. I can't wait!
How did we extract V? I'm glad you asked! First thing, age that roast to at least one week off. I promise it'll taste so much more flavorful once the degassing begins to subside! If you are pulling shots in its second week off-roast, try a :. "Golden" brew ratio* in - seconds (no pre-infusion was used on our end) at a F set point. As the roast ages to week three, try tightening up your brew ratio to closer to :. and pulling for - seconds.
Follow the entire series and let us know what you think!

With the doors at our Baltimore cafe now open, it feels like a good time to take a breath and reflect on the process. Our team at Ceremony has spent thousands of hours over the past year planning the space, training new baristas, and testing culinary concepts, all to bring Charm City denizens the cafe they deserve!
A key cog in opening  Park has been one of Ceremony's newest hires, the manager of our Baltimore caf - Jared Cate. Let's get to know this fellow a little better.
MH Hi, Jared. It has been pretty cool to see the hard work you've put into the cafe. Were you just born this amazing? What's your story?
JC Being a military kid, I have lived in many places. If you go by where I was born: Stuttgart Germany. If you go by where my parents are from: Tampa, Florida. If you go by most recent home: Boulder, Colorado. If you go by longest time in a location: York, England. (Is that a long enough answer?)
MH Wow. You're quite the globe trekker. How did you get started with coffee?
JC In college, I started drinking espresso drinks at a local coffee shop, and quickly came to the realization that I couldnt afford them, so I got a job there for the employee discount.
MH That sounds strangely familiar! So you, like me, got in for the perks. What has kept you in the game?
JC There are two things that have kept me in coffee for this long: The opportunity to continue learning about amazing coffee by being around it all the time, and being able to be a part of a community - making a simple but significant difference in customers' days.
MH What a guy. We're on the same page again. Customer experience is number one. Going back to your first point though - what is your current favorite coffee and favorite coffee of all time?
JC I currently keep reaching for the Ethiopia Wazzala. The depth of flavor and complexity keeps it exciting every time. My favorite of all time is the first time I tried a naturally processed Ethiopian Harrar. While it may not be my current favorite, it's definitely one of the most memorable coffee experiences I have ever had.
MH I think many people, both in and out of coffee, would echo your sentiments about that naturally processed Ethiopian eureka moment. I experienced the same deal with a batch brew of Wondo in NYC! Ok, few more questions. What is your favorite coffee ritual? 
JC I dont know if I have a favorite ritual. One of the things I love about the coffee world is that it is so diverse. You can have coffee in different ways all the time and not ever get stuck in a rut.
MH Great point! It really takes effort to make coffee brewing boring with how the seeds and the ideal parameters are constantly changing. Thanks for taking the time answer these questions, so we can get to know you a little better. What is something people might not know about you from meeting you in the cafe?
JC I have  kids! So far, they all like coffee, and my oldest boy is starting to learn to pull shots on our home espresso machine!
MH So if we run into staffing problems, we don't have far to look for new applicants! As a family-man and resident of Baltimore, what do you plan on bringing to your community's newest caf?
JC I want to bring an eye opening coffee experience to the Mount Vernon neighborhood, and Baltimore in general; not only though the quality of the coffee, but through the quality of service as well. The coffee world can sometimes seem unapproachable to the uninitiated, so our goal is to portray specialty coffee in a way that isnt off-putting, and gets people at every level of coffee knowledge excited.
MH I couldn't agree more. Specialty coffee doesn't have to be scary or intimidating. Rather, as our bag says, "Coffee should be something special" and the right group of baristas can make that happen for the folks of Baltimore! We hope you, dear reader, can find a moment to check out our new spot at  Park, and please feel free to say hello to Jared! Until next time, happy brewing!

The blend I created with % Santuario from Cauca since it simply was stunning; vibrant, juicy and a surgery sweetness. For the rest of the blend I was using...

Working together with Daniella and Pedro we are supporting their program Sol de Maana, the program is educating the farmers in treatments and knowledge for leaf rust and general coffee husbandry . This coffee is from Daniella and Pedro's own farm that they have invested in, to show the other growers what they can achieve in quality and simply how to get a higher price for a higher quality. Growing a coffee like Longberry truly shows how complex and lively a Bolivian coffee can be. /Joanna Alm, Head roaster
Caranavi, located  kilometres north of La Paz city, it has been noted as the centre of Bolivian coffee production. With the super rich soil combined with high altitudes, it has become the epicentre for coffee production in Bolivia.
Given the regions potential to produce unique exotic flavours it really is a hotbed for amazing coffee. Despite it s international recognition, Caranavi has neglected its coffee production. A mixture of ageing coffee plantations, reducing yields and leaf rust, combined with a high pressure towards coca cultivation has meant the coffee has been in decline. With coca being  times more profitable and with less growing issues, it has meant many producers have abandoned coffee production in favour of this lucrative crop. 
To try to save specialty coffee in Caranavi, our exporters Daniela and Pedro Roudriguez have started the project Sol de Manana. They have been sourcing coffee from small coffee producers in the region for three decades. However this steady decline of coffee production has not only put at risk the sustainability of there export business, but the future of coffee production in Bolivia is at risk of disappearing forever. 
They assumed the challenge of boosting the production and support the Bolivian coffee growing by the planting of new coffee plantations under a sustainable model based in three pillars.
Economical, Social and Environmental; Sol de Manana. In this project La Linda was the very first and perhaps most important farm. Besides Caturra and Typica, they are here growing new exotic varieties to plant in its farms and implement new processes post-harvest. This one is a very unique example of them being the Longberry varietal. This one amazed us with a white sugary like sweetness, elegance and floral notes. This coffee is one of the four coffees were buying from Daniella and Pedro this year. This being the smaller lot we only have  kilos, a true nano lot.

Nario is located in the far south-west of Colombia bordering Ecuador, and is in general one of the most challenging, but also most interesting places to work. There is extremely high elevation, coffee up to  meters, very steep hillsides, and mainly super tiny producers in remote areas.
General production in Colombia is based on smallholders related to a cooperative or association. Nordic Approach is working with the Growers Association Cafe Occidente, who are currently attracting a lot of great farmers as they have established a cupping lab, and through buyers like us pay the premium back to the growers.

The area of Tarqui in the region of Huila is relatively unexplored for specialty coffee.

One of the things that makes this coffee interesting is the fact that the parchment gets delivered in small quantities to the processing station almost every day, resulting in complete traceability and thus, better quality control.

Place plunger in just enough to seal the top, and keep coffee from dripping through.
 At  seconds, remove the plunger, and stir for five seconds. Place the plunger back on the aeropress to keep coffee from dripping through.
At  minute  seconds, remove plunger and stir for  seconds. Place the plunger and slowly push down for  seconds, until you hear a hissing sound. There should be moderate resistance. If it's very difficult to push down, your grind is too fine, if it's very easy, your grind is too coarse.
Make sure your coffee maker is clean and free of residue build up. Weigh out your coffee. A good ratio to start would be  grams (. ounces) of coffee to  liter (. ounces) of water.

Our wholesale relationships are very important to us. We welcome those who share the same values as heart when it comes to coffee. We are looking for cafs, restaurants, and others who want to prepare & serve high quality coffee.
A:Please fill out our wholesale contact formand a heart representative will get back to you!
A: We only hire Portland residents, so please feel free to drop your resume off in either of our caf locations during regular business hours.
A: In some cases we do make donations in the form of coffee, gift cards, or merchandise. We have a quarterly limit. Email us at coffee@heartroasters.com and well let you know if we can accommodate you.
A: Yes. We work with a select group of bakers and purveyors.
A: Yes we have free WiFi during the week, but not on the weekends.
A: We do not purchase labeled fair trade coffee. All of our coffee is purchased well above the fair trade pricing (which is a very low price). Fair trade does not guarantee producer sustainability, farmer sustainability, or quality coffee. Some of our coffees are organic but we do not specifically seek out organic coffees, as we primarily focus on taste, quality, & clarity. We do not advertise the organically grown coffee as such, when we are offering it.
A: For filter (home coffee makers, pour overs, Aeropress, french press), we recommend brewing anywhere from - days off roast. The coffee can be brewed at a later date and will still taste delicious, but we have found our coffee shines best within a week off roast. For espresso, we recommend brewing between - days off roast. There is CO that is created in the roasting process and while this can be beneficial for other brewing methods, it can hinder brewing with an espresso machine.
A: We currently roast Sunday-Thursday and ship on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. We ship you the freshest coffee available, so depending on how you choose to ship its anywhere from - days off the roast date.
A:We can! If you would like your coffee ground, please let us know whatbrewing system you need your coffee ground for, and we will happily grind it for you.
A: If your coffee tastes watery, first make sure you have the right ratio of coffee to water.  part coffee to  parts water is a great place to start. You can also try one of the following at a time and see if it makes a difference:
Grind your coffee finer;Extend your brew time; Use hotter water.
Remember, it is very important to use a burr grinder. This will reduce the variance in coffee particle size and result in giving you a more even extraction.
A: We have aspecific water filtration system, commercial grade burr grinders and other equipment,we use recipes and measure the extraction percentage with refractometers, the water is kept at a specific temperature each time we brew, all these things and more help us ensure consistency and a great cup of coffee in our cafs.
A: We think its unnecessary to order in bulk bags unless you are a caf, restaurant, or office. Coffee goes stale quickly if exposed to air, so unless you will be going through a lb bag in less than a week, we recommend you stick to the oz or lb. If you order coffee weekly and would like a better price, check out our coffee subscriptions!
A: We ship online orders Monday through Friday.If a major U.S. holiday falls on one of those days you can expect your coffee to go out the next available shipping day.

Examples: if you get your order in before pmon Monday, your package will ship on Tuesday;if you get your order in after pmon Thursday, your order will not ship until the following Monday. Note: Coffee Subscriptions only ship on Tuesday or Friday of each week.

Joe was founded in  as a singular specialty coffee house in manhattans west village with the simple vision of brewing the highest quality, unique coffees and serving them with unsurpassed hospitality and knowledge.  in order to bring such highly curated coffees to our customers, we worked alongside some of the most renowned domestic and international roasteries.
with the july  launch of our own roasting operations in red hook, brooklyn, we now roast % of our own single-origin and blended offerings.  whether in the roastery or in one of our now  cafes, we strive to effect our deeply rooted core value proposition: the desire to build, maintain and strengthen community at every level from producer to customer. 
) fair and traceable
at joe, we are committed to making certain that every green coffee transaction is both fair and traceable.  in addition to purchasing coffee directly from producers, joe also works with importers, exporters and brokers who are equally committed to selling coffee that can be traced back to the farmer, group, or cooperative.  through a traceable supply chain, we can ensure that farmers are paid well above both commodity prices and fair trade minimums for the coffees we buy.
) quality
the joe sourcing and selection team maintains stringent standards when selecting green coffee for our menu.  all beans, from the components of our House Selection to our rotating cast of single origin coffees, have met or exceeded our intense quality standards.  joes quality protocols require cupping (tasting) hundreds of samples of coffee per year, maintaining a seasonal rotation of beans, and working with importers and exporters who use the utmost care in transporting and storing the coffee.
) flexibility
joe is committed to flexibility when purchasing green coffee. we understand that each and every coffee producing country has its own unique purchasing infrastructure.  while joe works directly with farmers or cooperatives when possible, we also embrace other forms of ethical sourcing already established in certain regions.  some of the coffee we buy is certified fair trade, organic or shade grown, but our purchases are not limited to farms that have secured such certifications.
) sustainable relationships
joe strives to build sustainable and trusting relationships with importers, exporters, brokers and farmers. working with many of the same individuals each year can guarantee both quality coffee for joe and stability for our wholesale partners.  additionally, relationships with importers and brokers formed on a trusting foundation help us to perennially source only the best coffee from around the world.

Joe was founded in  as a singular specialty coffee house in manhattans west village with the simple vision of brewing the highest quality, unique coffees and serving them with unsurpassed hospitality and knowledge.  in order to bring such highly curated coffees to our customers, we worked alongside some of the most renowned domestic and international roasteries.
with the july  launch of our own roasting operations in red hook, brooklyn, we now roast % of our own single-origin and blended offerings.  whether in the roastery or in one of our now  cafes, we strive to effect our deeply rooted core value proposition: the desire to build, maintain and strengthen community at every level from producer to customer. 
) fair and traceable
at joe, we are committed to making certain that every green coffee transaction is both fair and traceable.  in addition to purchasing coffee directly from producers, joe also works with importers, exporters and brokers who are equally committed to selling coffee that can be traced back to the farmer, group, or cooperative.  through a traceable supply chain, we can ensure that farmers are paid well above both commodity prices and fair trade minimums for the coffees we buy.
) quality
the joe sourcing and selection team maintains stringent standards when selecting green coffee for our menu.  all beans, from the components of our House Selection to our rotating cast of single origin coffees, have met or exceeded our intense quality standards.  joes quality protocols require cupping (tasting) hundreds of samples of coffee per year, maintaining a seasonal rotation of beans, and working with importers and exporters who use the utmost care in transporting and storing the coffee.
) flexibility
joe is committed to flexibility when purchasing green coffee. we understand that each and every coffee producing country has its own unique purchasing infrastructure.  while joe works directly with farmers or cooperatives when possible, we also embrace other forms of ethical sourcing already established in certain regions.  some of the coffee we buy is certified fair trade, organic or shade grown, but our purchases are not limited to farms that have secured such certifications.
) sustainable relationships
joe strives to build sustainable and trusting relationships with importers, exporters, brokers and farmers. working with many of the same individuals each year can guarantee both quality coffee for joe and stability for our wholesale partners.  additionally, relationships with importers and brokers formed on a trusting foundation help us to perennially source only the best coffee from around the world.

	The climatic and geographical conditions of the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo are ideal to grow high quality coffee. However, infrastructure and trade have been in decline since the country gained its independence from Belgium in the s and were nearly destroyed in the years following the Rwandan genocide in .  Ongoing conflicts and violence caused many farmers to flee, abandoning their homes and coffee plantations. Producers who had nowhere else to go were forced to smuggle their coffee harvest out of the country to make a living.  Although the situation is still unstable, many farmers are looking for means to rebuild their lives again through agriculture. Fair Trade coffee, which has already proven a powerful conflict resolution tool in other unstable regions, has the potential to provide farmers and communities with sustainable livelihoods.
	
	Situated on the shores of Lake Kivu, SOPACDI (Solidarit Paysanne pour la Promotion des Actions Caf et Dveloppement Intgral) is one of few Congolese coffee cooperatives working with farmers affected by the regions constant struggles. With support from different organizations such as Twin Trading, SOPACDI has built its capacity to produce and export coffee to the highest of international standards. Due to the dire situation of coffee farmers in East Congo, Fair Trade officials took the initiative to allow SOPACDI to trade on Fair Trade terms on the basis of a documentary inspection, as the smoldering conflict in the region prevented FLO-CERT inspectors from traveling into the country. The cooperative became the first Fair Trade certified entity in Congo, with over , members of which an estimated  are women.

	A Hawaiian coffee bean from the Big Island that delivers. The sweetest Hawaiian coffee with notes of honey and chocolate on the nose with molasses, milk chocolate and hints of almond nuttiness on the tongue.  Rich and syrupy body with long aftertaste. Like a great Kona, only sweeter.


	Rusty and Lorie Obra started their Hawaiian coffee farm in , they stumbled upon an award-winning coffee region. Of course, they didn't know it at the time. The couple simply wanted to live in the Ka'u District, the southern side of the Big Island known for the Green Sand Beach near Ka Lae (South Point), the Punalu'u Black Sand Beach, and the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.


	Rusty, a retired chemist, arrived first. He took over  acres of an old sugarcane farm on the slope of the Mauna Loa volcano and started planting coffee trees. Lorie, a medical technologist, soon sold their New Jersey home and followed him to Hawaii.


	The couple quickly expanded their business to become farmers, processors and roasters of coffee. Because of their science background, the two ran their farm like a laboratory. They started testing different processing methods and roasts, looking for ones that would bring out the best flavors in their coffee. Rusty also organized the Ka'u Coffee Growers Cooperative, a group of about  Ka'u coffee farmers.


	Then Rusty passed away in , leaving Lorie at a crossroads. Could she handle the business with all of its manual labor on her own? Lorie thought about selling the farm, but she couldn't let go of Rusty's dream: to make Ka'u coffee one of the best in the world.


	In , Ka'u was vindicated at the Specialty Coffee Association of America's annual conference. Two of Lorie's fellow farmers in the Ka'u Coffee Growers Cooperative won th and th place in the Roaster's Guild Cupping Pavilion Competition. That same year, Rusty's Hawaiian was one of seven farms that ranked in the SCAA's top  Hawaii/Asia/Indonesia regional competition.

	This is a "natural" processed decaffeinated coffee or otherwise known as the sugar cane method. Let us take you to Dorkville real quick to provide some insight one what this specific decaffeination process is and how it affects the overall flavor of the coffee. Basically there are four basic decaffeination process that we know of or have been introduced so far. They are the Direct Solvent, Indirect Solvent, Swiss Water and Co.  
	
	For this specific coffee, we're going to focus on the Solvent based process. Now don't freak out. Let us expand on what this process actually is. To simplify, this processes is when the caffeine is removed from the beans with the help of a chemical solvent, such as methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. Those solvent based processes in turn can be divided into methods using the direct method and the indirect method. 
	
	This specific coffee goes through the "indirect" process. What that mean is, instead of applying the solvent chemical directly onto the beans, the beans are soaked in near boiling water for several hours, which extracts the caffeine as well as other flavor elements and oils from the beans. The water is then separated and transferred to another tank where the beans are washed for about  hours with either methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. The molecules of the chemical solvent selectively bond with the molecules of caffeine and the resulting mixture is then heated to evaporate the solvent and caffeine.
	
	Lastly, the beans are reintroduced to the liquid to reabsorb most of the coffee oils and flavor elements.
However, because of the impracticality of gathering natural ethyl acetate and its cost, the chemical used for decaffeination appears to be synthetic. Ethyl acetate is produced commercially from ethyl alcohol and acetic acid, which in turn may be produced from natural ingredients or petroleum derivatives.
In the direct method caffeine is removed by soaking the materials directly in a solvent; the solvent is directly applied to the beans. 
	
	Las Serranias is graded "A" decaffeinated process that uses a derivative from sugar-cane known as Ethel Acetate (EA). The pleasing characteristic from the sugar cane adds to the sweet acidity and banana, apricot and cream notes. More importantly, It's not giving the dirty flavors most decaffeinated coffees are associated with. Overall, it's a well structured, smooth, and balanced coffee.
	
	Although Las Serranias is not a part of the Las Mingas Project directly, it was produce by the founders. Las Mingas Project promotes coffee relatinships, a partnership that brings producers, exporters, and roasters together to collaborate. Giving farmers bargaining power and receive honest pricing for trading practices. La Serrania came directly from Virmax, a premier exporter of Colombian Specialty Coffees that works under Direct Relationship model. 
	
	Without a doubt, decaf drinker or not, you will appreciate and adore Las Serranias. Kenneth Davids from Coffee Review scored Las Serranias  points and stated this decaf as "delicately rich and fruit-toned. In the aroma distinct cocoaish chocolate complicated by fresh-cut fir. In the cup soft, wine-like acidity, lightly syrupy mouthfeel, and continued fruit-inflected chocolate."

	The La Avila Double washed offers a bright tangerine, lime flavor along with hints of sugarcane and  a creamy caramel body. With it's lingering sweet after taste and bright, juicy mouthfeel, this is a memorable cup that will get your day going!

	Instead of the usual washed process, "Double Washed, otherwise known as the "Kenya Method", puts an additional process of moving the coffee into a special tank to soak for an additional -hours. The tank is filled with water and the coffee is allowed to soak. The tank is then emptied, and the process is repeated, filling the tank again and letting the coffee rest for - additional hours. After the second soak, the coffee is then moved to the drying patios. This process is done similarly in Kenya and parts of Ethiopia, but the technique varies from place to place.
	

What drew Klatch Coffee to Las Mercedes was great coffee, but what we fell in love with was the people, the process, and their passion to make the coffee so great. It begins with hand picking only ripe mature cherries, and then subjecting them to intense screening before depulping to eliminate twigs, leaves and other foreign material. At the wet mill the cherries are received into ceramic tiled ditches, washed with fresh collected rainwater from their own tanks and immediately fed into a pulper, which consists of rotating disks or cylinders, each one fitted with adjustable knives. These are designed to separate the bean from the flesh of the fruit while leaving each bean intact in its parchment envelope. They then dry the coffee on clay patios to ensure even drying.


	The same care and consideration invested in the coffee is invested into the Las Mercedes community. The Ortiz Family has always been devoted to taking care of those who have helped in their success, by providing clothing, food and health care. In addition, Las Mercedes is constantly making efforts to preserve natural wild life by taking special care of the disposal of by-products from the mill in order to avoid contamination also, in compliance with our certifications, chemical and pesticides are carefully store and managed by trained personnel, avoiding intoxication and contamination. In the last years, a great effort has been made in planting native trees to preserve these species.


	Finca Las Mercedes is a beautiful coffee farm with dedicated owners who care for their community, their workers, the environment and, nonetheless, seek to provided specialty coffee.  We are proud to offer this limited Direct Trade coffee that is also Rainforest Alliance Certified. As part of our Direct Trade contract,  cents of every pound is given back to fund community sports programs and Los Ortiz medical clinic. To read more about Los Ortiz medical clinic please visit

Why you'll love it: Not only does this coffee taste delicious and refreshing when brewed hot or cold, it also represents a commitment to support and nurture the Haitian coffee industry.
Story of the bean: Farmers from the highest mountains of Southeastern Haiti overlooking the Caribbean grow coffee the way it has been done for two-hundred years - on small, family-owned farms alongside a diverse mix of shade trees, banana plants, and ground crops. Women cheerfully process and sort the coffee and load up the best grades for export on the colorful Tap Tap trucks to be delivered to the shipyards of Port Au Prince.
The resulting elegant, velvety-smooth coffee is a perfect example of what we mean by a culinary coffee and stands as a testimony to the abiding smallholder Haitian farmers with whom we are excited to have this historic partnership.

How do I pick a coffee? Baffled about which coffee to pick? Take our Coffee Quiz! Or feel free to give us a call or email us (--- or help@lacolombe.net. Our Coffee Crew would love to help you find a coffee that suits your taste buds.  What are cupping notes? Does this mean your coffee is flavored? Our coffees do not contain added flavors. However, each of our single-origin coffees and blends has its own unique flavor. Those flavors and aromas come naturally from the coffee bean and can be affected by factors like country of origin, altitude, growing practices, processing techniques, and roasting styles. Coffees roasted more lightly have more of the characteristics unique to eachorigin, while those roasted on a darker level have more of the classic chocolatey and smoky tones found in our Classic and Reserve Blends.  The tasting notes that youll find on your bag of La Colombe coffee are what we taste when we brew and drink the coffee. By creating a simile between what were tasting in the coffee and familiar flavors weve had before (chocolate, apple pie, toasted marshmallow, etc.), its easier to communicate the often complex tastes that coffee can take on.  What grind should I choose? The choice of grind will depend on how you brew your coffee. Usually, we recommend ordering your coffee whole bean and grinding it fresh before you brew. But if you dont have a good-quality grinder, let us pre-grind it for you! We recommend the following grinds for specific brewing methods: Drip for regular automatic drip coffee machines Melitta/Chemex for pourovers Turkish a fine grind for Turkish coffee French Press a semi-coarse grind for immersion methods Home Espresso a fine grind for home espresso machines Commercial Espresso an even finer finer for commercial espresso machines Percolator a grind only to be used for a percolator coffee maker  Why does grind size matter? Read more here. What are your caf location and hours? Our national locations and hours can be found at our Cafs page here at this link.
What is the best way to store coffee? The best way to store coffee in an airtight container in a dark cupboard. Theres no need to freeze! Just keep your beans away from sunlight, air, and humidity.  How long is the shelf life? We recommend drinking your bagged coffee within  weeks of the roasting date. The coffee will not spoil after this date, but it will lose the amazing aromas and flavors we strive for in roasting.  Our cans of coffee remain fresh for about a year.  Our Pure Black cold-pressed bottled coffee has a shelf life of - weeks.  How do I brew coffee? There are infinite ways to brew coffee, and all coffee folks have their own strong opinions as to what makes the best cup. For our recommendations, check out our brewing tips video or our blog.

Reserve Blends are modern and refined specialty blends take you on a journey of different flavors, all while remaining within the traditional coffee wheelhouse.

We seek the best coffee farmers in the world with whom to 
work.This leads us literally to their doorsteps. We collaborate with 
our producers in the effort to generate beautiful coffees. Our direct 
relationships yield stunning coffees from exceptional producers.


  Once a coffee is in our roastery, we obsess about perfecting the roast
 for that coffee. We roast coffee by hand (sight, smell, sound) and cup 
every roast. Each coffee is roasted daily to highlight the taste of 
place that is unique to each farm and origin.The next day we do it all 
again, tweaking the roast if necessary to liberate the most distinctive 
and captivating flavors of each coffee.  


Once a coffee is roasted we ship it to you the same day. When you buy 
coffee from one of our stores, you will never find a bean that is over 
one week out of the roaster. Our devotion to freshness ensures that you 
will get delicious coffee every time, and it is only one of the services
 we provide!


When you order a drink from one of our baristas, you may wonder why 
our coffee tastes so incredibly good. The skill and passion they bring

When designingour seasonal blend Telemetry, we look at our entire lineup of single origin coffees from that season, and think about the flavors each varietal is bringing to the table, and how they may work together to create a blend that is sweet, bright, and rounded in its flavors and character.
We've designed the component seriesto allow you to explore the construction of Telemetry. Each pack includes a oz bag of each Telemetry component, as well asa oz bag of Telemetry itself. Taste them separately, or together, and build your own understanding of how we structure our blends, and how unique flavors can work together to create something really special.

At ReAnimator Coffee, we are driven by the experience of coffee: whether the experience is sourcing coffees at origin  in Ethiopia or Guatemala, or anywhere around the world  or cupping with our broker partners; roasting production coffees or new crop coffee samples; or tasting the latest batch off of our roaster. Everything we do is in pursuit of that experience. Coffee is not simply a utility, but a noble beverage, and we are constantly amazed by the complex interactions it creates in our brains and our society, the connections it forges, and the creativity that it inspires. We are always compelled to learn more. We are driven to understand the challenges of producing this beverage and supporting and sustaining the hard work of the communities and families whose livelihoods depend on the planting, harvesting, and processing of coffee.Just as we are driven to seek this knowledge, we are also driven to pass this knowledge on. It is our purpose as a roaster to provide to our customers not only an outstanding coffee experience, but to impart as much information about our coffees to our customers as they care to know.It is this curiosity and determination that helped get us to where we are today, and it is what continues to make us a better business.

Forty years ago, a cup of coffee was nothing more than a caffeine delivery vehicle. It didn't really matter how it tasted, it just had to slap you awake in the morning or prop you up through a long afternoon. But in the last decade or so, things have changed. A lot. A few people scattered across the country discovered how amazing a cup of coffee can be when you source the beans directly from farmers you know. When you roast the beans yourself in such a way that nothing intrinsic to the coffee is removed. When you brew the coffee with down-to-the-second precision.
Ritual has been a pioneer in this delicious shift in coffee consciousness since we opened our doors on Valencia Street in  and started what some call a coffee revolution in San Francisco. Our goal then--and our goal now--is to craft the very best cup of coffee available anywhere. Period. We've learned a lot over the years, but the care and attention we lavish on our process is unchanged, including tasting every coffee several times before it goes out to our coffee bars and into your cup.
We don't do all of this to make coffee more complicated. We do it because pretty much everybody who works here has had a moment where a really, really good cup of coffee changed their lives.

From ancient Ethiopian highlands to your breakfast table, coffee is a global experience. This daily ritual is our inspiration to grow and challenge ourselves. With that in mind, weve created the Farmlevel Initiative, committed to ethics and excellence.
Before finding its home in your mug, Verve coffee passes through many hands. Farmers, Roasters, and Baristas all play an integral role in crafting the cup. The Farmlevel Initiative supports every hand that holds our coffee, from seed to cup, positively impacting communities at the local and global level. By connecting farmers at Farmlevel, with you, at Streetlevel, the Initiative creates an open line of communication that transcends distance, language, and culture.
The Farmlevel Initiative is vital to the future of coffee. At Farmlevel, it shows farmers that their work matters, their attention to detail is noticed, and that we support them every step of the way. It supports paying our farmers premiums for quality coffees through direct trade relationships. Our direct trade practice allows us to exceed Fair Trade minimums every time, no exceptions.
At Streetlevel, the Initiative lets you experience the most incredible coffees in the world, while knowing that youve positively impacted global communities with every sip. By purchasing a bag of Verve Coffee, you are committing to ethics and excellence.
Verve Coffee Roasters is an energetic and growing company with over  employees. The Company has become widely known for outstanding service, nationally recognized baristas, and for sourcing and roasting the world's finest coffees. Our growth and success stems from an uncompromising passion to continuously challenge and radically improve the status quo. At the foundation of our organization is a dynamic team of exceptionally talented, fun, and passionate people.

Stout and creamy with carmalized flavors of chicory root

Two hundred years before we started selling our coffee in San Francisco, the French brought coffee
infused with stout, carmalized flavors of chicory root to the shores of New Orleans. Blended with
creamy whole milk and organic cane sugar, our ready-to-drink, cold-brewed version pays homage
to that tradition in a sweet, nostalgic carton.

Our road trip-ready iced coffee is made of three simple ingredients: coffee, water, and time

Designed to inspire adventure and movement, our portable cans promise days on the trail, at
the beach, and camping with friends-in one adorable and sustainable package. The taste is luminous
yet dense, bright yet chocolatey, small yet powerful.

In the late s, the Turkish army swept across much of Eastern and Central Europe, arriving at Vienna in . Besieged and desperate, the Viennese needed an emissary who could pass through Turkish lines to get a message to the nearby Polish troops. Franz George Kolshitsky, who spoke Turkish and Arabic, took on the assignment disguised in a Turkish uniform. After many perilous close calls, Kolshitsky completed his valiant deed, returning to give the Viennese the news of the Poles imminent rescue of their city. On September , the Turks were repelled from Vienna, leaving everything they brought: camels, tents, honey, and strange bags of beans, which were thought to be camel feed. Kolshitsky, having lived in the Arab world for several years, knew these were bags of coffee. Using the money bestowed on him by the mayor of Vienna for his heroic deed, Kolshitsky bought the Turks coffee, opened Central Europes first coffee house (The Blue Bottle), and brought coffee to a grateful Vienna.

 years later, in Oakland, Calif., a slightly disaffected freelance musician and coffee lunatic, weary of the grande eggnog latte and the double skim pumpkin-pie macchiato, decided to open a roaster for people who were clamoring for the actual taste of freshly roasted coffee. Using a miniscule six-pound batch roaster, he made a historic vow: I will only sell coffee less than  hours out of the roaster to my customers, so they may enjoy coffee at its peak of flavor. I will only use the finest, most delicious and responsibly sourced beans. In honor of Kolshitskys heroics, he named his business Blue Bottle Coffee, and began another chapter in the history of superlative coffee.

Now, more than  years later and thanks to the enthusiastic support of many loyal customers, Blue Bottle Coffee has grown to a small network of cafes, an espresso cart, and some vintage German coffee roasters. We are still united by the simple purpose of getting great coffee to everyone who asks for it. Improbably and delightfully, there are hundreds of us now. We roast coffee on vintage gear, put it in compostable bags, and still get it to our customers within  hours. We roast great coffee in four cities, make great drinks, clean up after ourselves, bake cookies, type up invoices, get change at the bank, and say please and thank you. We offer the elderly and pregnant our seats on the bus and brush and floss daily. We look forward to seeing you soon.

Because it was conceived just . miles from our Oakland roastery by Aerobie (those wonderful folks who created an improbably long-flying disc), we'd like to humbly assert that the AeroPress is our first locally-produced piece of merchandise. Its a peculiar and lovely device  easily the most durable and portable option for brewing quality coffee. It produces a cup thats thick and focused, but still quite nuanced.
Comes with a set of  filters (and filter-holder), coffee grounds funnel, coffee scoop and stirring paddle.

Whether you are looking for an espresso grinder or a grinder to help you explore that extensive range of brew methods, the Encore is a great all around home grinder.
Over the years, the Maestro  has come to be lauded by coffee experts as THE go-to grinder for those who love both drip-coffee and manual brews. Building on that platform, Barazta has developed the Encore, with upgraded burrs to give a great grind for drip/manual brew and also fine enough for espresso. The Encore also has a completely new gearbox.

Featuring  individual grind settings, from fine to coarse, the Encore can please any palate with its gamut of accurate and repeatable grind settings. The Encore has an accurate medium to coarse grind for the increasingly popular manual brew methods such as pour-over, Aeropress, Siphon and Chemex. The specially designed burrs give a precise grind with minimal fines for a flavorful, balanced extraction when making espresso.

And, of course, the Encore is built with the quality Baratza parts youve come to trust. The efficient DC motor keeps your beans cool, even during extended grind times, while a combination of electric and gear speed reducers slow the burr to  RPM, ensuring a smooth bean feed and reducing noise, heat and static buildup.

Beyond a great coffee-drinking experience, the Encore makes for a great coffee-making experience. A convenient, front-mounted pulse button makes it easy to grind on demand into your brew basket. Whether you are looking for an espresso grinder or a grinder to help you explore that extensive range of brew methods, the Encore is a great all around home grinder.

Turn almost any Baratza grinder into a real time, weight-based grinding machine.
Make your great grinder even better with Baratzas innovative Esatto, an accessory that can turn your Baratza grinder into a real time, weight-based grinding machine. Set the weight you want and the Esatto does the rest, weighing the ground coffee within a tenth of a gram while grinding, and stopping automatically.

The Esatto is an accessory that is designed specifically for use with your Baratza Encore, Virtuoso, or Preciso.  With its easy assembly and simple operation, you will be grinding by weight in minutes. The Esatto was initially designed for use in a manual brew bar in a caf, eliminating the need to manually pre-weigh coffee beans.  The built-in precision load cell provides accurate weighting, while grinding, to within . grams. Three user-programmable buttons make for repeatable, one- touch grinding.

The Esatto is a perfect way to showcase home brewing methods and equipment. Use the Esatto plus a Baratza grinder on the manual brew bar, and show your customer that they can purchase the grinder, brew method and coffee for use at home.
Digital Control Panel: The front-mounted control panel with LED display is easy and intuitive. Three programmable buttons allow the user to program in the desired weight (+/- .)  Simply press the START button, and the Esatto automatically delivers precise dosing.

Whether you are looking for an exceptional espresso grinder or a grinder to help you explore that extensive range of brew methods, the Preciso is the perfect grinder for you.
The Preciso is a beautifully designed conical burr coffee grinder that works as hard as you do to create the perfect espresso experience. It doesnt stop there of course; the Preciso has also received high marks from coffee experts as an exceptional grinder for the increasingly popular manual brew methods. The specially designed burrs give a precise grind with minimal fines for a flavorful, balanced extraction.

The Preciso is true to its name  a precision grinder with a micro-adjust system that can be dialed in like a commercial grinder. This, coupled with a coffee throughput that is  gram/second faster than other mm conical burr grinders, makes the Preciso exceptional for espresso. In addition to featuring Baratzas popular -grind adjustment options, the Preciso adds a second micro-adjustment level that further divides each of the  steps into  distinct settings. This means you have significantly more control over your espresso grind.

The Preciso features the quality internal parts and external elements youve come to expect from Baratza. It also comes equipped with our innovative PortaHolder, allowing you to grind your espresso hands-free, directly into the portafilter for quick setup and cleanup.

Great coffees balance sweetness, acidity and body to create the perfect cup of coffee. The Baratza Vario is a perfect example of a great grinder combining ease-of-use and a sleek appearance with a penchant for bringing out fantastic flavors in your beans.

This professional-grade grinder fits anywhere, from your kitchen to your office to your caf. While sporting a small footprint, the Vario features an impressive range of capabilities, boasting  distinct and repeatable grind settings from fine grind for espresso to course grind for press pot.

The design is beautiful as well as functional. Varios intuitive macro/micro adjustments make it easy to get the grind for a perfect espresso finish. Need something a little different? With a simple slide of the lever, you can switch from espresso to other coffee styles. And it couldnt be easier to get the perfect amount  digital timers and three user-programmable buttons make accurate one-touch dosing and repeatable grind times a snap.

The Varios unique mm ceramic flat burrs provide accurate, fast-grinding performance and remain sharp for twice as long as the best steel burrs. The high-torque DC motor and belt drive transmission mean your beans are in for a smooth, cool ride.

As always, its not just whats inside that matters; the Varios smooth operation carries over from internal to external, with front-mounted, easy-access control units, an  oz. grounds coffee collection bin, and Baratzas exclusive PortaHolder for hands-free grinding into an espresso machine portafilter.
Burrs: The Varios  mm professional ceramic flat burrs produce accurate grinding, high throughput and remain sharp for twice as long as the highest quality steel burrs. The Vario grinds . grams/second at Espresso and . grams/second at Press. The broad range of grind ( microns to  microns) and the narrow particle distribution (lack of fines) are the hallmarks of the superiority of the Vario burrs.
Digital Control Panel: The front mounted control panel with LED display is easy and intuitive. Three programmable buttons allow for grind time setting within . second (about . gram). Simply press the START button and the Vario automatically delivers precise dosing.
Grind Adjustment: The Vario offers macro and micro adjust for fine tuning with ease. The macro adjust moves from espresso to press pot in  distinct and repeatable settings. A secondary micro adjust arm further divides each of the  macro steps into  distinct settings. These steps enable you to dial in the exact grind for the perfect shot.
Grinds Left in Grinder: To maximize freshness, the Vario minimizes the ground coffee left in the grinder.
Brewing Methods: The Vario is exceptional for espresso and manual pour brewing methods.
Motor: A powerful, high torque DC motor effortlessly drives the burrs. This motor turns slowly resulting in cool, quiet operation and permits long grinding duty-cycles. The circuitry is equipped with an automatically resetting, thermal cutoff switch.
Calibration: The Vario is calibrated at the factory to ensure an accurate range of grind. If necessary, the Vario burrs can be easily calibrated using the special calibration tool that comes with the grinder.
Portaholder: The Vario comes with the Portaholder which permits hands-free grinding into an espresso portafilter and makes clean up a snap. The regular  oz. grounds bin is also included.
Cleaning: Burrs are easily removable with no tools, making cleaning very easy.
Hopper extender: An extension that can add  oz. of capacity to the existing  oz. bean hopper. Several extenders can be added to get to the capacity you need.

The Virtuoso lives up to its name by providing technical skill, classic style and a consistent, quality grind.
Grinding for espresso? Let the Virtuosos professional-grade mm conical burrs perform their magic for a consistent, fine grind. How about a French Press? The Virtuoso can handle that too, with a particle size uniformity that gives you consistency from cup to cup. In fact, the Virtuoso is so consistent at both the coarse and fine ends of the grind range that we consider it to be in a class all by itself  and so do many of the micro- and specialty-roasters who swear by it.

The secret to the Virtuosos consistent, smooth grind is two-fold: an efficient DC motor keeps your beans cool, even during extended grind times, while a combination of electric and gear speed reducers slow the burr to  RPM, ensuring a smooth bean feed and reducing noise, heat and static buildup.

The Virtuosos exterior is just as finely tuned as its interior  a convenient front-mounted pulse button allows for grinding directly into an espresso filter basket, while a -second timer means that its easy to replicate the ideal grind time. With the Virtuoso, the look goes beyond merely functional. A sculptured metal top and base give this grinder an expensive, elegant image that adds a sense of class and quality to kitchen counters and coffee shop workspaces alike.

When you want it all, the Virtuoso is the grinder that will get you there with function, elegance, and style.

The Bella is the wool sweater of our blends -- warm, comforting, familiar. Wild and citrusy organic African paired with earthy organic Indonesian makes for a vivid and fairly complex Moka/Java blend. It seems to weather the rigors of the automatic drip machine as well. This is, perhaps, why it's our most popular blend. It is also on the darker side: nice and thick without being inelegant. Bella stands up to milk or cream well, and is easily enjoyed black.

El Sombrero is an exceptional coffee coming from the southwest of Colombia. Grown at high elevation in a humid, topsy-turvy area of the Andes, coffees from the Huila District are typically known for their intensity and buttery red fruits. El Sombrero, however, which grows in the speck of a town called Suaza, takes on a completely different and more delicate profile, demonstrating how microclimate and individual producers can significantly alter a coffees character. The masterpiece of a handful of farmers and producers, El Sombreros ripe cherry is hand-turned in fermentation tanks before being dried in miniscule batches. The result is a distinctive and jubilant washed coffee reminiscent of a brisk herbal tea with sweetgrass and florals. Its vernal qualities may make you pause to consider the absolute versatility of one plant: its open structure allows notes of lemongrass, brown sugar, and marmalade to linger gingerly in the mouth for a pleasantly long while.

A blend of organic coffee that is quite dark and chocolaty. Maybe a bit more one-dimensional than the Bella Donovan, but it is a good dimension. Giant Steps is delightfully fudgy and thick in a French press or drip pot, and stands up to cream quite well. If it were any heavier-bodied, you could pour it on pancakes.

We developed this espresso over five years ago for the launch of our Kiosk on Linden Street. This is probably our darkest espresso: lower-toned, minimal brightness, plenty of chocolate  with an engaging complexity as a straight shot. The shots are gorgeous: achingly heavy with voluptuous red-brown crema, and the silky, somewhat dangerous-looking viscosity of a power-steering stop-leak product once used on our (now departed) heroically battered  Peugeot. In milk, it tastes like chocolate ovaltine, and holds its own from the daintiest oz Macchiato to our towering oz caffe latte. This is the most Brahmsian espresso we have. Brooding and autumnal, it is a coffee to mourn the passing of time.

Cristobal Fernandez has the patience of a farmer and the vision of an artist. In just a few years, he has transformed his mountainside farm from wild overgrowth to a productive mosaic of heirloom cultivars. Penetratingly cold nights slow maturation and prolong the season. The Last Picks is comprised of Cristobals final harvest of . More mellow and sweet than earlier lots, this cup seems to sigh delicious relief to have made it to the finish line after months of ripening on the branch.

Equal parts talent and luck, this Kenyan coffee hails from the southern slopes of Mt. Kenya, where conditions for coffee cultivation couldnt be finer. Add to this one of coffee's best accidentsthe diminutive peaberryand you have a resounding cup. Many believe that the naturally occurring peaberrywhere the coffee cherry produces one plump, round bean instead of two halvesdoubles the flavor and sugar of the seed and is easier to roast. Year after year, Kirinyaga coffees are beloved for their ripe, fruit-forward profiles. This one, grown by smallholder farmers and processed at the Kirinyaga Factory, does not disappoint. Whether its the fine soil, the high elevation, or the influence of the otherworldly peaberrythis coffee sparkles. Imagine verdant kiwi, with its star-like glitter of black seeds, crossed with the tropical notes of lemongrass.

Our New Orleans is a sweet and thick iced coffee, cold-brewed with roasted chicory, then cut with whole milk and organic cane sugar.

Whats in a name? Well, weve always been fans of the opascope, a beautiful tool for projecting handwriting and finely rendered artwork onto a larger surface. We could blab for hours about its quaint design, its bulky contours, its place in our childhood classrooms. But for expediencys sake, lets put it this way: The opascope is a tool for taking careful craftsmanship and opening it up for everyone to access and enjoy. Sound familiar? Available only in the Bay Area and online, the three-component Opascope Espresso is a refreshing addition to a lineup once dominated by dense, chocolatey selections. It yields an effervescent shot, packed with stripes of tropicalia.

What makes the Bushoki a paragon among Rwandas outstanding coffees? The landscape for one. Located in the north of the country, the Rulindo district is among the most mountainous in Rwanda, home to its tallest mountain, Mount Kabuye. Nestled amidst rolling hills, the Bushoki Washing Station sits in a shallow valley rich in groundwater. The ample water allows the station to process its Bourbon fruit in the style of a Kenyan coffee, where the cherry undergoes extensive scrubbing and pulping. The finer things in life tend to improve with age, and the Bushoki is no exception. When young, its explosively aromatic. As it settles, it does what Rwandan coffees do best: finds balance amidst contradictions. Where creaminess meets brightness, and ripe fruits marry with savory herbs, the silky, citric, and brisk Bushoki is a cup for the ages.

This coffee is generally a blend of Congolese and two different Ethiopians coffees. Together, these components produce a big, chocolaty aroma and excel in just about every prep method, save espresso and siphon. Unlike some of our fancy-shmancy single origins, this blend has a very easy-to-like personality, good body, unthreatening complexity, and a reasonably clean aftertaste. The coffeestwo Ethiopians, one dry-processed and one wet processed; and a wet-processed Congoleseleave subtle imprints of dried blueberries and cardamom. A fairly dark roast, this inclusive blend will take milk or cream well. Some say damn well.

The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of , popularly known as Proposition , is a California law intended to protect California citizens from chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm and to inform citizens about exposures to such chemicals.  One such chemical is acrylamide, which may be present in coffee, including the coffee sold by Blue Bottle Coffee.  Acrylamide is a naturally occurring byproduct formed when certain sugars and an amino acid react to high temperatures, such as when coffee is roasted.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not determined that the low levels of acrylamide naturally found in roasted coffee have any public health impact. Your personal cancer risk is affected by a wide variety of factors. For more information on acrylamide, please consult the FDAs website at fda.gov.  For more information about both acrylamide and Proposition , please visit www.oehha.ca.gov/prop.html.

The Bella is the wool sweater of our blends -- warm, comforting, familiar. Wild and citrusy organic African paired with earthy organic Indonesian makes for a vivid and fairly complex Moka/Java blend. It seems to weather the rigors of the automatic drip machine as well. This is, perhaps, why it's our most popular blend. It is also on the darker side: nice and thick without being inelegant. Bella stands up to milk or cream well, and is easily enjoyed black.

We met Moisés Herrera and Marysabel Caballero—the couple that runs Finca El Puente—in . Since then, they have become like family and inspire us every year. From experimental coffee varieties and growing techniques to unique ways of processing, they push the boundaries of quality. This mostly Catuai-variety lot is lush with notes of Concord grape accented by a brown-sugar sweetness that finishes with a crisp, toasted nut character.
Recognizing Uganda’s incredible potential for quality, we worked with our partners at the Chema washing station to create some unique coffees. This lot was specially selected from the highest farms in the region and processed using underwater fermentation—in place of their usual dry-fermentation method—to create a momentous coffee with bright notes of black cherry and cola with a creamy body.
Grown on the northwestern slopes of Mount Elgon in Uganda, this natural sundried coffee is the result of trial experiments and our collaboration with the Chema washing station. With flavors of grape candy, berries, and sweet spices, this special-preparation lot sourced from the Kabeywa community redefines what to expect from Ugandan coffee.
This coffee comes from the area of Calvas in southern Ecuador near the Peruvian border. Fifteen growers cultivated Typica and Caturra varieties on very-small organic farms to produce this single-community lot. Look for simple and sweet notes of chocolate and almond balanced by a creamy body.
In the western district of Nyamasheke, Rwandaonly a few kilometers from the beautiful Lake KivuJarama is an exciting new farm. Planted in  and , this -hectare farm, and the organization that manage it, are already receiving awards for their quality. Look for notes of raisin, brown sugar, and clementine.

The term Las Redes is Spanish for "the networks," and each group of farmers the Cenfrocafe Cooperative works with in Northern Peru has a different network name based on the micro-regions their coffees come from. This particular lot is a blend of a few micro-regions that we decaffeinated with an organic water processleaving intact buttery notes of cocoa powder, walnut, and plum.
We pay extra attention to decaf because we know people love it solely for its flavor. For Slow Motion, we start with great coffee—from the same farmers we work with for all of our coffees—and decaffeinate it in small batches using chemical-free water processing.

Uganda is not a country well known for specialty coffee. Farmers in the lush volcanic hills of Mount Elgon grow excellent SL- and SL- varieties at some of Africa's highest elevations, but, for years, poor processing has held them back. The Chema washing station is pioneering processing improvements at every step to bring us a refined coffee with savory notes of stone fruit and cocoa.

Uganda is not a country well known for specialty coffee. Farmers in the lush volcanic hills of Mount Elgon grow excellent SL- and SL- varieties at some of Africa's highest elevations, but, for years, poor processing has held them back. The Chema washing station is pioneering processing improvements at every step to bring us a refined coffee with savory notes of stone fruit and cocoa.
The term Las Redes is Spanish for "the networks," and each group of farmers the Cenfrocafe Cooperative works with in Northern Peru has a different network name based on the micro-regions their coffees come from. This particular lot is a blend of a few micro-regions that we decaffeinated with an organic water processleaving intact buttery notes of cocoa powder, walnut, and plum.
The Idido cooperative is located just east of the small, bustling town of Yirgacheffe, Ethiopia. Its members—situated throughout seven communities in the area—are growing some of the highest-altitude coffee in the region. We work closely with this organic cooperative year after year to select their best coffees, which are known for their sweet and delicate floral, melon, and citrus notes.

To start, Boka is a one-name kinda personlike Beyonce, Madonna, or Beck. And it seems quite fitting for a grower who is known in this area of the Eastern Highlands for growing great coffee. Boka grew up here and was childhood friends with Nichol Colbran of the Baroida Estate. In the s, Boka planted coffee under a government project that promoted growing coffee in the area. Under this project, Boka was able to plant coffee on about  hectares of land, and today his son Jack Boka manages many of the activities.
This single-farmer lot from Boka was made possible by the Colbran family who, this year, set up their washing station to keep coffee cherries from the communities of Kobuta and Bonta separate every day as it was delivered. By coincidence, on July  and , Boka was the only grower who delivered coffee cherries to the washing station, and, with this stroke of luckand careful notation by the Colbranswe were able to buy our first-ever single-farmer lot from the community of Bonta.
Eastern Highlands, Papua New Guinea
The coffee-growing region of Papua New Guinea's Eastern Highlands is one of the most remote places we travel to. The climate here, rich topsoil, elevation, and sometimes-unpredictable weather also make it one of the most unusual places for growing coffee. It is here in the rolling grasslandsbetween the village of Bonta and the Baroida estatethat Bokas farm is situated. Even though Bokas farm is considered a small estate in Papua New Guinea, he has about  hectares of land, which is fairly large compared to many small single growers we work with.

We first purchased coffees from PROCAFEQ association in , and we were stunned by how great the coffees were. Sadly, since then, the cooperative has struggled with a leaf rust epidemic that severely affected production. We have bought small lots of coffee over the last few years, but this year we are back to larger quantities of coffee from this great association. This particular lot showcases the best coffees from the area around the town of Calvas.
The origin of the name "Calvas" comes from the river of the same name that serves as a border with Peru.
Loja, Ecuador Coffee production in the Southern Highlands of Ecuador began in , and, throughout its history, coffee has been produced on small, roughly one-hectare farms by farmers committed to organic agriculture and environmental conservation.
Loja, within the Cuxibama Valley, is covered by over % hills and mountains. The coffee farms here are small––most around a hectare––and the region exhibits diverse agroforestry systems, most notably the Podocarpus-El Condor Biosphere Reserve, considered one of the most-important sites for biodiversity in the world.

We met Moisés Herrera and Marysabel Caballero—the couple that runs Finca El Puente—in . Since then, they have become like family and inspire us every year. From experimental coffee varieties and growing techniques to unique ways of processing, they push the boundaries of quality. This mostly Catuai-variety lot is lush with notes of Concord grape accented by a brown-sugar sweetness that finishes with a crisp, toasted nut character.
Marysabel Caballero's maternal grandfather, Felipe García, established the family's coffee farms and passed them down to his daughter, Sandra, who shares ownership with her husband, Fabio, and their children, Marysabel and Fabio Junior. The family divided their land into a number of parcels, assigning specific areas to individual family members who manage those areas independently. Finca El Puente, for example, is one of Marysabel's areas, which she owns and manages with her husband, Moisés Herrera, along with land that he brought to the marriage.
Originally from Guatemala, Moisés came to Honduras in the s for work with a Guatemalan coffee company, but he ended up buying some land of his own outside of Marcala and becoming a coffee grower before he met Marysabel. Together, they dedicated themselves to producing the highest-quality coffee they could, and, when they heard about the first coffee quality contests in Honduras, they naturally entered the coffee they had grown together. Right away, their coffee started to win prizes in these contests, and coffee from Finca El Puente began a winning streak that is unparalleled.
Today, Finca El Puente is one of the most-innovative farms in the world, growing exotic coffee varieties under unique conditions, testing experimental processing techniques, and generally pushing every aspect of coffee production to improve the coffee and the farm itself.
El Puente translates to the bridge in Spanish and is named so for a section of the farm that is close to a bridge that goes over a natural spring.
 Marcala, Honduras
Marcala is in the southern-Honduran region of La Paz, which is approximately an hour drive from the border with El Salvador. This high-elevation town is dry and dusty with more pine trees than one might expect in a tropical climate, but the Caballero-Herrera's farms are blessed with plentiful natural springs, and they have chosen to conserve a good deal of their land in order to protect this resource.

For over a decade Counter Culture has been focused on the Southern Region of Rwanda. Here we have  worked with cooperatives and other organizations, in particular Bufcafe, the owners of the Remera washing station. This year when we heard that Sam Muhirwa, who manages Remera was branching out and helping organizations in other areas of Rwanda with quality, developing specialized lots, and finding buyers for the coffee, we were intrigued.
Jarama itself comes from the Teuscher organization. Teuscher  bought approximately  hectares of land in the village of Gihombo in  and planted  separate farms there; Kamajumba, Nyaruzina, and Jarama. This lot that Counter Culture selected is exclusively from Jarama and is situated right above the Murundo washing station that this year processed all the coffee from Teuscher. The Murundo washing station also buys coffee from growers in the area. Selections from the washing station this year placed th and th in the Rwanda Cup of Excellence. Not too bad for a relatively new company, and farms in their second year of production.
Nyamasheke, Rwanda
The Nyamasheke district is situated in the rolling mountain landscape of Southwestern Rwanda.  Much of the area rests at the shores of the beautiful Lake Kivu across from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the district also encompasses areas of the Nyungwe Forest Preserve.  This areas high elevations have made it a place historically known for tea production, but it also in these high elevations that the region is also being recognized as having some of the best coffees in the entire country.

Grown on the northwestern slopes of Mount Elgon in Uganda, this natural sundried coffee is the result of trial experiments and our collaboration with the Chema washing station. With flavors of grape candy, berries, and sweet spices, this special-preparation lot sourced from the Kabeywa community redefines what to expect from Ugandan coffee.
For years we have scoured the world looking for places to test and produce the great natural sundried coffees. Our experiments have included countries throughout Central America and recently have included projects in East Africa. Our natural sundried coffees from Rwanda and Burundi have been particularly impressive. To keep expanding our search, we started testing coffees in Uganda. Unlike Burundi and Rwanda, Uganda is already known for processing natural sundried coffees, but they are also known to produce some of the worst sundried coffee in the world. Often picked green and dried in the dirt, specialty buyers and producers in Uganda have avoided special-processed naturals.
This particular lot is the first natural coffee the Chema washing station has ever produced, and it is an entirely different natural sundried coffee from what Uganda is known for. This coffee was sourced solely from the high elevations of the Kabeywa community and was meticulously dried and sorted for us. The test batches of this coffee won a cupping competition in East Africa this year, and we are very happy with this first experimental natural sundried lot from Uganda.
Some of the highest-elevation coffee farms in the Kapchorwa district that deliver coffee cherries to the Chema washing station for processing are in a village called Kabeywa.
Kapchorwa, Uganda
Kapchorwa in eastern Uganda is home to a chain of volcanoes—most notably Mount Elgon, which straddles the border between Kenya and Uganda. The soil is rich and the elevation is high, great for both coffee and other types of agricultural farming. It also rains a lot which keeps the climate relatively humid, especially given the altitude. The rain keeps the Sipi river flowing and creates three waterfalls, cascading from different spots on the river's course down Mount Elgon.
The Chema washing station sits between the first and the second waterfall and receives coffee cherries from farms , meters above sea level all the way up to , meters. The washing station provides centralized wet processing, as well as mechanical drying and some raised bed drying. Because of the heavy rains in the area, they built a custom retractable roof for their raised bed drying system, which protects the seeds from moisture damage. The station also processes cherry pulp for fertilizer, has an excellent waste-water treatment system, and provides farmer training and support.

Bolivia is a notoriously difficult place to buy and export high-quality coffees—with the biggest challenge being transporting coffee from farm to dry mill to ship in a timely fashion and at the right humidity level. Those who know and love Bolivian coffees from this region know of the challenges of trucking them from the mountains down the affectionately named "Death Road of Coroico" to the very-dry region of El Alto before being packed on ships in Peru to finally voyage to us.
We've purchased from the Cenaproc cooperative in Bolivia since , and each year we refine the process we use to get the best coffees. This year we introduced new standards for quality and strengthened our partnerships with the Cenaproc cooperative and a local cupping lab. This work helps with coffee selection and addressing issues early in the season—setting the stage for better coffee and timely export.
Cenaproc was founded in  and is one of the most-recognized cooperatives in the region. Currently, the cooperative has approximately  members that come from three main areas close to their wet mill in Caranavi: Nueva Llusta, Nueva Canaan, and Libertador. Cenaproc competed and won awards in the Bolivian Cup of Excellence competition numerous times since .
The average amount of land in production for each producer is between  hectares. Most producers apply liquid and solid fertilizer that they create on their farms.
"Llusta" means "slippery" in Ayamara, the indigenous language spoken by a number of the producers of this coffee. The town bears this name because, during the rainy season, the earth turns to mud and becomes quite slippery. In addition, mud is a valued resource for the community, as many of the houses are constructed of bricks made from the hardened mud.
Nueva Llusta, Bolivia Nueva Llusta is located in the Yungas jungle in Bolivia’s western mountains. Most coffee farmers in Bolivia are small scale with between one and eight hectares. Though this area has the perfect ingredients for quality coffee production, it has struggled for a while because of insufficient infrastructure. In the early s, the government began focusing more on enhancing the necessary infrastructure for success of their coffee market.
Agrarian land reform began in , but it was not until the 's and 's that land reform was a large part of Bolivia’s national agenda. Agrarian families were then given title to land and encouraged to move back to rural areas to cultivate citrus and coffee. Since Evo Morales has been in power in the early s, he has continued to give land incentives to rural farmers, which have made coffee farming a more viable livelihood for individuals.
The producers in Nueva Llusta generally have a great amount of shade and often grow a variety of citrus and fruit trees in addition to their coffee production. They are also known for their success with processing the coffees on their own farms before taking the coffee to the dry mill.
Luis' family consists of four people: Luis, his wife, and two children. His farm is called "Finca Huayhua" after his last name because he puts so much effort into it. An expert in coffee farming and processing, Luis often shares his knowledge with nearby farmers, and his passion for excellence is not only contagious, but evident in his farm. Luis has approximately  hectares of property total, of which about . hectares are used for coffee cultivation. There are a number of shade trees on his property in addition to agricultural products consumed by his family. The farm's coffee trees are between - and -years-old.

Recognizing Uganda’s incredible potential for quality, we worked with our partners at the Chema washing station to create some unique coffees. This lot was specially selected from the highest farms in the region and processed using underwater fermentation—in place of their usual dry-fermentation method—to create a momentous coffee with bright notes of black cherry and cola with a creamy body.
Uganda is a country with incredible potential for quality: They grow great botanical coffee varieties at high elevations, but, for years, poor processing held them back. All of that has been slowing changing as investments in washing stations and drying systems started popping up around the country. Drying is particularly tricky: Heavy rains, often during the harvest, make it difficult to properly dry coffee—washed or natural.
During our first visit to the Chema washing station, serving the greater Kapchorwa region, we calibrated on coffees, consulted on better drying practices, and committed to paying premiums for specific—instead of general—lot separations. This may sound basic, but tweaking processing and setting aside more traceable lots requires a lot of work, especially for an operation that can process up to four tons an hour. In particular, Thomas (ECOM Agroindustrial's country manager) and Deus (head of quality control) worked hard to improve every step: from coffee cherry selection at buying stations, to implementing special processing methods, to longer drying times.
Masira is the name of the village with the highest farms in the Kapchorwa district delivering to the Chema washing station.

This coffee represents a blend of coffees from the Colbran family including Baroida, Kobuta, and Bonta. These late-harvest lots are remarkable because of major advancements in executing meticulous processing, which led to one of the biggest quality-improvements we have seen from any grower we have worked with. These coffees are remarkable because of increased attention paid to fermentation, better cupping and quality control standards in their lab, and drying to very-low final moisture content. The lots are below % moisture content—outside the normally accepted levels for drying coffee, which are typically closer to –% depending on country of origin. The Colbran family’s willingness to experiment and take risks for the sake of quality puts these coffees in their own class.
The Colbran family has gone from selling their coffee to larger commercial exporters, which would often blend their amazing coffee into large undistinguished lots, to having one of the most-recognized farms in the country for quality. This recognition is for good reason: The family's focus on traceability, lot selection, and refinement of processing can't be understated. This year represents our fourth year working with the Colbran family, and we couldn't be more grateful for and impressed by their dedication to producing the best coffee possible.
Eastern Highlands, Papua New Guinea
The coffee-growing region of Papua New Guinea's Eastern Highlands is one of the most-remote places we travel to. The climate, rich topsoil, elevation, and sometimes-unpredictable weather also make it one of the most unusual places for growing coffee. Much of the area where our coffees come from are rolling grasslands with coffee farms dotting the landscape. Farms here can range in size greatly, with some farmers having just a few hectares to larger producers with  hectares to Baroida, which has more than  hectares.
Baroida was founded by Ben Colbran and his wife, Norma, in the early s. At the time, the surrounding land was mostly grassland, and for the first two years Ben cultivated vegetables that he sold in the coastal town of Lae.
In , Ben followed the government's encouragement to plant coffee, which thrived in the micro-climate. Ben owned Baroida until , when he sold the land to a trust with Ben's son Nichol remaining onboard to manage it. Nichol managed the operation until , when he left to work on other projects. In , Nichol bought the land back, but, in the six years he was gone, the farm had fallen into disrepair. Fortunately, the Colbran family immediately started to turn things around—while helping to create positive livelihoods for the local producers around the farm. In the last  years, Nichol's son Chris, along with his wife Melody and his brother Rhett, have also become integral to the operation. In addition to the Colbrans, now in their third generation on the farm, there are more than two dozen key employees with years of experience who make the coffee possible.

Big Trouble offers nutty, caramel flavors people know and love, which may seem easy—and our goal is to make it easy to enjoy in any brewer—but it's actually one of the most challenging for us, because clean, sweet, low-acidity coffees from small-scale farms can be elusive.
Hologram is our update of the classic Mocha Java flavor profile. Fruit-forward and chocolatey coffees combine to create something distinctly complex.
We pay extra attention to decaf because we know people love it solely for its flavor. For Slow Motion, we start with great coffee—from the same farmers we work with for all of our coffees—and decaffeinate it in small batches using chemical-free water processing.

Our coffees
All our coffees are carefully sourced from our favorite origins based on a philosophy where quality, traceability, innovation and social responsibility is the main focus. We work closely with all the producers we buy from and over the years we have established close relations with most of them. Countless hours are spent developing the coffees we sell both at farm level and in our roastery and QC-lab.  
We only sell a small range of coffees and our offerings are constantly changing. This is because we only buy small lots of coffee from the different producers we work with and we try to make sure the coffees are as fresh and tasty as possible.  We only roast coffee to order for our wholesale customers to ensure freshness and quality. 
Our goal is to create a product that is as transparent as possible so that you can experience the taste of the terroir and the cultivar of each and every coffee lot that we sell.
Training
We offer free training to all our wholesale clients to make sure that our coffees taste great whenever and wherever they are served.  If you are not able to get our coffees to taste good, please contact us and we are more than happy to help you dial in the brewing parameters to achieve sweet and clean tasting cups of coffee.

Our New Orleans cafe opened recently and we couldnt be happier to help keep one of the most vibrant and incomparable cities in America awake and feeling up. Heres a look back behind-the-scenes into what weve been up to this week. 

Were a hanging a shingle in the Big Easy. Were swinging open our doors on April  with a Cold-Brew focused cafe in the city that put iced coffee on the map.  All proceeds of the day will go to the New Orleans nonprofit The Roots of Music.


Portland artist Wynde Dyer creates vivid tarp quilts that present a proposal for a new kind of sharing economy. On view at our Portland Division cafe.
On its fifth birthday, we take a look back at the origin story of the Cold Brew stubby.  
We traveled the spaceways from planet to planet and helped keep artists and performers awake and alive to the mysteries of the cosmos in Seaview, Washington. 
Were very sweet on these *dairy-free* Coconut Cold Brew Truffles created by our multi-talented coworker and part-time chocolatier Kelly Rey.
We dont know why or by whom coffee seeds were first roasted but we think it was a really good idea.
The theorems of how people came to roast coffee are shrouded in lore. Legend has it that th century goat herds in Ethiopia were seen eating unknown red berries and soon after were allegedly seen to be dancing naturally, their trusty shepherds followed suit.
Down the line, this coffee cherry was named diabolical by monks, thrown into the fire, and the fumes emitted therein were deemed divine. The only thing we can confirm is the nature of that holy roasted coffee bean.
Throughout history, people have roasted coffee beans over fires and in stoves. Later arrived the inventions of larger batch roasters and many of the machines built in the early twentieth century are the grandpaps of what we use now  in fact, most of the Probat roasters we use in our roasteries today were built mid-century. We currently have seven Probat drum roasters. Working with these old guys is like using a seasoned and well-loved cast iron skillet.
The roasting process is essentially a chemical decomposition of green coffee beans by heating. Things are both lost and created while roasting coffee. A green coffee bean changes as it is heated in many ways, but three of these changes are common in kitchens everywhere. They are known as Maillard reactions, Strecker Degradations and Caramelization  we have these guys to thank for roasted coffees aroma, flavor, sweetness and rich brown color. 
The Maillard is a browning reaction  its what makes toast taste different than stale bread. Caramelization is the breakdown of sugar molecules under high heat, which unearths an array of sweet, bitter and nutty flavor molecules. These processes change starch into sugars and then caramelize those sugars.
Very broadly speaking, at Stumptown, we tend to roast coffees at a medium roast. The whole truth is that we source really high quality coffees and roast each coffee just enough to bring out the best and full potential of whats inherent in each particular coffee already. Through roasting, we aim to draw out things like acidity, floral notes, chocolate, molasses, and earth.
All of the coffees flavor potentials are presented at the first crack  an audible signal that happens at a particular point when roasting coffee. After that, were roasting enough to add the right amount of body and sweetness, without degradation.
In other words, the goal is to bring out the best acidity, flavor and sweetness in each coffee thats brought to the surface through roasting, without tasting what weve done to it. If you continue to roast past that point, youll begin to taste the roast. Now some people love that roasty flavor,  and for you fine people, we make our French Roast. You can still taste some of the lovely inherent qualities of the coffee but you also are tasting the actual roast.
We dont have a roasting approach in general, as much as a general guiding principle in which all the coffees potential is revealed to you with nothing standing in the way,  says Jim Kelso, head of Quality Assurance in our Roasting Department. We want to honor the coffee producers. We dont think what weve done on a machine is more important than what theyve done to grow and process this coffee.
As always, were here to help! Ask your cafe barista, give us a shout at info@stumptowncoffee.com, or tweet us @stumptowncoffee for more specific roasting questions.
Independence Day is around the corner so weve asked some of our favorite Portland chefs to share coffee-inspired recipes to fire up our grill game on Americas birthday.
Executive Chef Andrew Gregory of The Woodsman Tavern mixed us up a Cold Brew Brine, a sweet & savory long game marinade, perfect for fish or chicken.
NOTE: If you dont have Cold Brew, use  cups of water and  / cups coarsely ground coffee beans to replace the Cold Brew and water in the recipe.
Combine all ingredients and heat just enough to dissolve the salt and sugar. Do not overheat or boil as this will change the flavor of the coffee and may make it bitter.
The salmon is brined for  hours. You could do less, but I recommend . For chicken, I would recommend - Hours. This would work with beef and pork, as well.
Remove the salmon from brine and pat dry. Lightly season with salt, and grill, bake, or sear in a pan. For the salmon, shoot for an internal temperature of  F for medium, or until the fish is slightly firm to the touch.  
Gregory made the accompanying salad with seasonal produce  cherry, cucumber, snap pea, basil, scallion and sherry vinaigrette. All of the vegetables are raw and cut into bite-sized pieces. Toss with olive oil, sherry vinegar, lemon juice, salt and black pepper.
Executive Chef Joshua McFadden of Ava Genes pulls off a fresh & cool grand finale that highlights the best produce of the season.
This is a very simple spring or summertime dessert. Granita is a Sicilian shaved ice  you can really apply this idea to any liquid you can freeze. Use an assortment of seasonal berries, stone fruits, or melons. If you cant find fresh local fruit, you could use dried fruit steeped in water, fruit juice or coffee. If fresh fruit is out of season, dont use fruit. Substitute with anything seasonal that sounds good to you  you could also use nuts or cake.*
Crack the coffee in between a sheet of parchment with the back of a pan. Put coffee, cream, sugar and salt in a pan.  Bring to a simmer. Pull off heat, let cool to room temperature and refrigerate overnight. The next day, strain, and whip to medium peaks.
Pour cold brew into a shallow metal pan and place in the freezer. As it begins to freeze, use a fork to scrape it into coarse frozen, separated crystals. Occasional agitation helps to create the best results. Once it has reached a frozen Superman ice cave consistency, you can cover it up and keep it in the freezer. Before you use it, scrape it again.
Combine Hair Bender coffee cream and seasonal berries and top with Cold Brew Granita.
Whiskey and Coca-Cola are as American as apple pie. We invite ourselves to the party and add Cold Brew to keep everyone shimmying post-BBQ food coma.
Stir together the whiskey, Coke and Cold Brew with ice. Strain into a glass, and serve over ice.
We are huge fans of filtered pour over coffee around here  and were big on experimentation, too. So we decided to do a little coffee filter tte--tte with our Coffee Education team to find if a filter affects the final outcome in a cup of coffee. Spoiler alert: It does.
First, a bit about our experiment  one of our main objectives here was to find out how much the filter alone affects the taste of the brew. To do this, we knew we needed to isolate the filter from the brew method.
For our first experiment, we poured water through the filters to see what the paper tasted like. Then, we poured water through a second time to find what was being imparted into your coffee after you rinse your filters.
Our second experiment was to taste coffee poured and brewed through each filter. So we brewed all the coffees the same way through each filter to taste the difference.
The Chemex filter itself was the cleanest and the most neutral. The Chemex cup of coffee had a thinner texture, brought out the floral notes, and a bit of dryness in mouthfeel.
The Oxygen Bleached Melitta filter had little residual paper taste when rinsed. This cup was a bit heavier with a fuller texture, and no notable paper flavor.
The natural Melitta filter imparted a notable woody sweetness after the first and second rinse. This filter imparted a papery flavor to the coffee, with a very noticeable dryness.
The Hario V filter was grassy at first taste, but rinsed clean on the second pass. The V coffee was bright and very crisp with high citrus notes.
The Sock cloth filter imparted the strongest flavor, and let us tell you, it wasnt pretty.  The coffee had a noticeable finish that was a bit like a wet wool coat. Somebody said it reminded him of a thrift store in Eugene, Oregon.
Choose an oxygen bleached filter, like the Melitta white, Chemex or Hario V. If you insist on using a natural, rinse the hell out of it. Toss the sock.
We were surprised how much of a difference the Hario V filter made  the paper is a high quality paper made in Japan. It is a lighter weight, with more texture and the result was floral and bright, with a lighter body than the Melitta and bringing out more citrus notes in the coffee than any of the others.
The Able Kone is actually a brewer, not a filter. Its essentially a stainless steel cone with small holes in it.
It is designed to fit neatly inside a Chemex, but you can brew it into anything that supports it. The difference in taste between a Chemex paper filter and the Able Kone is a big one.
The Chemex is one of the heaviest paper filters, resulting in a very clean cup, while the Kones brew produces a much thicker, chewier cup of coffee with more fines (tiny coffee particles), oils and sediment. Its actually a brew with the mouthfeel and texture similar to the French Press.
Able also makes stainless steel reusable disks for the AeroPress, called The Disk. It comes with two options, Standard and Fine, which have have different sized holes and levels of durability. The Standard Disk brews a fuller body cup of coffee with a bit more fines and can take a bit of a beating  this one should last for years of brewing and is three times as thick as the Fine Disk. The Fine Disk brews a sweet clean cup of coffee with very little fines  it is much more delicate and should be handled with care.
Again, here youll find a big difference when brewing paper versus stainless steel. The paper collects much of the fines and oils that you taste when brewed through a metal disk or cone, so your cup will be less nuanced.  If you prefer a cleaner cup, stick with the paper. For a fuller-bodied cup, or if youre looking to go paper-free, try the Disk.

The holidays are just around the corner so we thought wed share some tips on how best to brew for a crew of guests. 
A lot of us here make our daily coffee through single cup pour overs like the Bee House and Chemex at home, which can be tricky when brewing for a crowd. Here are some helpful hints to you keep you going strong through to the requisite pie course.
French press pots come in different sizes. We like the Bodum, which we sell in a -cup, -cup and -cup in our online shop. See our best brewing practices in our brew guide. Just remember when using a press pot, its crucial to pour the coffee out of the press after your  minute brew is complete or the coffee will keep extracting and youll end up with coffee you can chew. And thats a gift to no one.
These are great options for a smaller crowd, and if you have the time and free hands. You can always brew a couple of Chemex pots and pour them into a carafe that will keep your coffee hot. For a  ounce brew, we use  grams of coffee (about  level Tablespoons.) 
We have kind of a love affair with the Bonavita Thermal Carafe brewer. It heats the water to the ideal brewing temperature of around  degrees, allows for a bloom with its shower-like water spray, and shuts off so your coffee isnt continuously heating on the heating plate. But wait, theres more! The insulated carafe keeps your coffee hot for hours. We like like this brewer.
If you do have an electric coffee brewer with a heating plate, we recommend that you turn it off or remove the coffee from the heat so as to avoid the old cooked gas station coffee situation.
Preheat your serving cups and mugs with hot water to keep your coffee from cooling down too quickly.
Pour your French press or Chemex brewed coffee into a thermos. For your best bet, dont keep the coffee in your thermos or carafe for more than an hour, especially when brewing French press.
Our Ethiopia Mordecofe is a prime time dessert coffee  its clean tea-like qualities cut the sweetness of pumpkin and fruit pies.
Guatemala Finca El Injerto Pacamaras intensity of flavor, complexity and acidity balance rich and heavy holiday menus. Its the Champagne of our holiday coffees!
Costa Rica Montes De Oro is an ideal house guest for a gingerbread cottage.
The Colombia  El Jordan has delicate bright notes that go along with any menu. It has a great long finish and distinct chocolate notes. A definite crowd pleaser!
Hair Bender is a bang up cure for a bender. Make it your New Years hangover helper.
As always, weve got your back. Feel free to holler at us at info@stumptowncoffee.com or tweet us @stumptowncoffee for brewing tips or suggested coffee pairings.
These guides serve as a good place to start. The grinder you use, coffee you choose, and yes, even the water from your sink, can alter the taste in the cup. Every machine is different, so you&#
A sleek and simple daily pour over, the Bee House is a favorite around here for its ease of use, and clean, sweet cup character. Its a Japanese update on a classic paper cone brewer. Melitta Bentz invented the first version of this brewer in , using her sons blotting paper and a punctured brass pot. Today, you can find Melitta filters just about everywhere.
Measure g or (about  Tablespoons) of coffee beans. Grind them to medium fine or about as fine as table salt. 

Fold a Melitta # filter down the scalloped edges. Insert it into the Bee House Brewer and place it on top of your mug or pitcher. Pre-rinse the filter with hot water to rinse out the paper flavor and preheat your brewer and mug. Make sure to chuck this rinse water before you begin brewing. Add the ground coffee to the filter and zero out the scale.

Start the timer once you add hot water. Saturate the grounds, then give them a stir to break up the clumps. Coffee degasses or  blooms when its fresh  the coffee bed should rise up  and bubble up a bit. 

Pour the water evenly in a spiral over the coffee bed and slowly fill the brewer to the top. Pour over the dark spots and avoid the light ones as you bring the weight up to about g by :.

Once you hit :, your mug should be almost full (or you should have about  oz of brewed coffee). If there is still water in left in the brewer at this time, dont sweat it. Remove the dripper from atop the mug and place it in the sink. 

An iconic brewer with a timeless design invented in , the Chemex is easy to use and easy on the eyes. The Chemex is housed in the MOMA permanent design collection it also lives on most of our kitchen counters, too. It  brews a clean cup and maintains body and balanced floral notes.
Place the Chemex Filter in the brewer with single fold away from the spout and multiple folds lined up against the spout. Rinse the filter with hot water to get a nice even seal all the way around. This preheats the brewer and gets rid of any paper flavor from the filter. Dump the rinse water and fold the filter toward the spout to reinforce this area.
Add g or about  Tablespoons of coffee ground kind of like Kosher salt. Center the coffee in your brewer and zero out the scale.
Start the timer when you add the hot water. Pour until all the grounds are saturated or until you reach about g. Stir with a chopstick or spoon to make sure there are no dry clumps.
At :, start the second pour, making sure to reintegrate the coffee and water. Pour with a wiggling motion, then a gentle spiral until the volume reaches about a fingertip down from the top of the rim or g of water. Pour over the dark spots and avoid the light ones.
At :, fill the brewer flush to the top or about g of water.
At :, you should be pretty close to volume. Look at the glass bubble or belly button, which indicates  ounces. Lift the filter. Its okay to hover for a couple of seconds to make sure you have enough volume. Then pull the filter out completely and let it drain into the sink.
Swirl the Chemex around a little and youre ready to serve two cups of brewed coffee. 
Theres nothing better than cold brewed coffee on a hot summer day  or if youre like us, any day, really. Cold Brew coffee is naturally smooth and sweet and less acidic than coffee brewed with hot water. The Filtron Cold Water Brewer is a simple way to make several cups  of cold brew concentrate. Cold brewing takes between    hours (we recommend ) but the payoff is huge. This batch should keep you buzzing for days. We recommend a ratio of : coffee concentrate to water over ice, adjusting to taste.
Take the rubber stopper and plug the hole at the bottom of the coffee bowl.
Take the Filtron pad and fit it snugly in the bottom of the coffee bowl. It should be domed up in the center when its in place correctly.  If you are using it for the first time, give it a good rinse. When not using the pad, be sure to store it in cold water in the fridge.
Measure  ounces or  lb of coffee. Your coffee should be ground coarsely to  about the consistency of breadcrumbs. Pour it directly into the coffee bowl and  give it a shake to even out the coffee bed.
Place the coffee guard right on top of the coffee grounds. This will help the water distribute evenly and keep the coffee bed flat during brewing.
Add  ounces of cold water for  ounces ( lb) of coffee. Fill to the the  lb line inside the Filtron water bowl. If youre filling it over the sink, cover the hole at the bottom with your finger so the water doesnt drain out. Or, just add water directly to the water bowl.
After you pour the water in, let it brew for  to  hours. We recommend . Store it in your refrigerator.
After  hours, the concentrate should be ready. Use the handle of the coffee bowl and lift it above the empty  / liter decanter. Pull out the stopper slowly over the decanter and set it on top to drain. This should take about  to  minutes and will make several cups of concentrate.
Pour over ice. We suggest a ratio thats one part concentrate to two parts water. Adjust to your taste. The concentrate will keep in your refrigerator for about  days. Beware! Cold Brew coffee goes down smooth and easy, but packs a potent punch. Sip slowly, or add lots of ice, water, or milk to keep you from flying too close to the sun.
With its stainless steel and wavy contours, the Kalita Wave wins over coffee and design enthusiasts alike. Its a favorite pour over brew method for home use and its great on the go, too. The flat-bottom filter helps with even extraction while brewing.  The key to mastering this brewer is the slow spiral pour. 
Place and rinse the Kalita Wave filter in the dripper. This removes the paper flavor from the filter and warms everything up. Heat up your mug while youre at it.  

Discard the rinse water from the carafe or mug and grind g (about  Tablespoons) of coffee as fine as table salt. Add it to the filter, making sure the bed is completely flat. Place the Kalita Wave on top of a carafe or mug. Tare your scale to zero.

Saturate the dry grounds completely with g of hot water right off the boil (about F) in the first  seconds and allow it to bloom. Coffee degasses or blooms when its freshthe coffee bed should rise up and bubble a bit. Give the coffee a stir with a spoon. 

At :, pour water up to g in a spiral motion by :. The spiral motion helps give you an even extraction and keeps everything integrated.

Pour small amounts (-g of water) periodically to hit g by :. Submerging dark spots and avoiding light spots, slowly bring the water level to the top for an even extraction. 

Your brew volume should reach approximately ml or about to the top of a oz mug  at : to :. Remove the Wave from the carafe or mug and set it in the sink for the rest of the water to drain through. 

We start with the highest quality coffee, cold brew it without heat for over  hours, then use a double filtration process to procure the end result: a complex, smooth and full-bodied brew with low-acid and a chocolate finish. Feelings of invincibility and euphoria are likely to follow.
You don't do dairy. Say no more. We've mixed our life-affirming Cold Brew with the finest coconut cream from Sumatra, Indonesia for a dairy-free, vegan game changer. Coconut Cold Brew is made with three natural ingredients so separation is bound to happen. For a good time, shake it like you mean it.
Our cascading and creamy Nitro Cold Brewis now available in a pop top. Pour it like you mean it into a glass or drink it straight from the source.
We bottled up our Original Cold Brew so its ready to go wherever you are. Enjoy straight out of the bottle or pour over ice. Cheers!

      “Every Stumptown employee is a steward of that single coffee cherry, from the time it gets picked until the time it ends up in your cup. Stumptown is an energy and a vibe and a culture, but it all ultimately revolves around amazing, incredible coffee.”

We work hard. We make lots of jokes. We cheers beers, ride bikes together, go to shows and trade dogsitting favors. We have tremendous amounts of respect for each other and for what we do. Stumptown is a family on an elemental level. Many of us are artists, musicians, creative types, and passionate types. It helps our coffee taste better and it makes our work lives richer.
And we drink the best office coffee on the planet.  
Some of us came because we were regulars. The baristas knew our drinks and were having a whole helluva lot more fun than the jobs we had. Some came because of the coffee. Some of us were home roasters, or worked for other coffee companies across the country. Came for a chance to work with the best green coffee in the world.
Some came because our best friends worked here. Most became best friends with our coworkers, because they also happened to be some of the best, most interesting people around.
We all came because we wanted to be here. A grip of us have been here for over a decade. Weve outgrown our first employee holiday dinners, squeezed in the backroom of a cozy Italian family restaurant in Southeast Portland. Weve leapt across the country. Went Dutch for a summer. But our holiday parties still rage.
We are passionate group of folks, some might even say obsessive. No matter which team were on, were sourcing, roasting, tasting, testing, practicing and pushing ourselves to do it better.

          We know we are the last link of a long chain, stretching across the earth, made up of hundreds of people and years of toil, soil and sweat to get this coffee into our hands. We take that responsibility very seriously. And we also have a lot of fun.

        Coffee is about pleasure. It’s that moment when your hand is warmed by the mug, you bring it up to your nose, inhale deeply and then take a sip.
      

        That sip is the culmination of years of work, three-thousand mile journeys, and passion. Here is how we make that sip perfect.
      

        While you are holding that cup of coffee, close your eyes. Open your mouth slightly. Breathe in deeply through your nose.
      

        You are smelling the most complex thing humans consume. When people talk about the flavors of coffee — notes of orange, or hints of clove — it’s because those organic molecules are contained in the coffee bean. If a coffee reminds you of apple pie, it's because coffee shares some of the same components as food, like lactic and malic acid.
      

        Inside that small bean are the same natural components that make flowers smell so lovely, the same ethers that let you know when a piece of fruit is ripe. Coffee has twice as much going on, molecularly speaking, as red wine.
      

        When tasting coffee, try waiting for it to cool down a little — you’ll be able to taste (and smell) the most when it’s the same temperature as your body.
      

        Flavor only matters in the context of you. What do you like? What does this scent remind you of? Are you looking for a full-bodied cowboy co
        ffee, or a delicate, tea-like finish? Chocolate aromas, or hints of jasmine?

        Dont worry if you cant describe it precisely, or have a different perception than someone else. Even when you cant put it into words, youll know what you like.
      

        You experience the full flavors of the coffee bean if and only if nothing has gone wrong during
      

        Someone stands by that roaster, all day, a person who knows exactly how to bring the best out of every bean — that ideal ratio of sweetness to acidity, that balance — because he or she has been doing this for years.
      

        Again and again, they repeat the same motion: pull a tiny sample of the beans. Stare at them, looking for the tiny signs of perfection. Smell them deeply. Put them back. Pull out some more beans. Stare. Smell. Five seconds later, repeat the process in a meditation that last hours. Do that hundreds of times a day. Do that every day for years.
      

        Know every bean on a personal level. Adjust times and temperatures throughout the day, knowing that  seconds could make the difference between letting this bean shine and overwhelming it. Know that in the morning, the roaster is cold. Know that in the evening its hot, and you should probably shave  seconds off that roast.
      

        Roast just enough to bring out the best and full potential of what’s inherent in each particular coffee already. Roast to draw out things like acidity, floral notes, chocolate, molasses, and earth. All of the coffee’s flavor potentials are presented at the first crack – an audible signal that happens at a particular point when roasting coffee. After that, roast just enough to add the right amount of body and sweetness, without degradation.
      

        Roasting different coffees as though theyre the same? Not going to work. Roasting for color, not taste? Never this.
      

        Please dont burn those beans. Theyve been through so much. Theyve come all the way across the world.
      

        The best coffee grows in the most remote places. There is a thin band that goes around the world near the equator. Within that band, you need mountains, thick old-growth forest and just the right microclimate. Set aside up to four days to get there.
      

        On your way there, you’ll pass through Houston’s H.W. Bush Intercontinental Airport, or you’ll stand in the endless security line at New York’s JFK en route to distant parts of Ethiopia, Colombia, Indonesia and  other countries around the world.
      

        You’ll also experience  vaccines (the malaria pills—which can cause hallucinations and nightmares—are the worst), a passport that fills up with handwritten visas, bumpy eight-hour van rides, granola bars and in at least one case, eating the heart of a bull that has been slaughtered in your honor.
      

        The Green Team members, named for the color of coffee beans before they are roasted, don’t do it the easy way, which would be buying bulk, mid-quality beans at a trading floor in a capital city. Instead, they go right to the source of the best coffee — that farm or washing station high atop a distant Ethiopian hill. It ends when they arrive at that distant farm, washing station, factory or mill. They sit down in a home or around a campfire to talk about this year’s crop with a producer they have met many times. They get to work.
      

          In Colombia, if you go to four farms you will get four bowls of sancocho, which is this soup with chicken, yucca, plantains, potatoes, corn, avocado. Basically, its as many calories as you can cram in a bowl.
        

        The Green Team visits every producer as often as possible, sometimes up to three times per year. They constantly roast and taste the coffee, and they form long-term, lasting partnerships with the producers. They’ll help them implement a new farming technique that could lead to even better coffee. Or they’ll teach a seminar on a new way to process coffee cherry, which is the fruit of the coffee tree surrounding the seed or bean.
      

        They routinely pay producers up to four times what they could get for their crop on the commodity market, but in return, they ask for a lot more work—hand picking each cherry at ideal ripeness, or implementing a new piece of equipment.
      

        The Green Team also identifies potential future producers—maybe this side of the mountain has just the right climate, but the quality level isn’t there yet. Stumptown will invest in that farm, or mill, or factory if that producer is willing put forth effort to get the beans to the level the Green Team looks for. It’s a partnership, and there is prestige and pride involved. For a producer, selling to Stumptown means something.
      

        Above all, they want to help farms become sustainable and to set up strong businesses that build up their communities and produce the highest-quality coffee possible year after year.
      

          Our partners are much more than farmers, they are coffee production experts, constantly innovating practices in planting, harvesting and processing the best coffees around.
        

        We don’t buy in bulk on a trading floor. We buy directly from the people who are making the coffee. It’s not a transaction; it’s a partnership. If someone is growing the quality of coffee we’re interested in, then we will help them in any way we can. That means regular visits (even though that trip can take up to four days), implementing new techniques and equipment, and forming long-term partnerships.
      

        We shoot for sustainability, and not just in the environmental sense. A sustainable coffee producer is someone who is paid fairly for their incredible work and who can in turn encourage others to follow in their footsteps. A sustainable producer innovates, develops and improves cultivation and in turn can fetch even higher prices from Stumptown. The more each side of the partnership puts in, the better the coffee gets.
      

        We dont call them farmers, we call them producers, which gives credit to the fact that they are production experts. They are the ones who make this coffee great. They are the ones who are like-minded, who will go the extra mile for quality, whatever that means.

          Producers are the heart of what makes great coffee.
        

          Their skills, expertise and craftsmanship is the difference between mediocre coffee and coffee that is like nothing you’ve ever tasted before. The coffee will never get any better in quality once it lands in our hands, after all. We rely on the producers for that pristine bean. A good roaster works tirelessly to preserve that coffee’s inherent greatness.
        

          The producers grow the coffee trees. They pick the cherry when it is perfectly ripe. They remove the outer fruit, leaving just the bean covered in a thin parchment. They rest the beans, let the beans develop into their full selves.
        

          Everyone on this page does something slightly different — he may tend a small patch of coffee trees on the farm he inherited from his grandmother; she may oversee the cherry soaking in a big tank of water, fermenting at just the right rate.
        

          They live on four continents. They speak at least  different languages. Some use traditional methods that are centuries old; some have taken out four-year loans to get that new top-of-the-line piece of equipment that will lead to a greater, cleaner cup.
        

          It’s not the easy way. It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way, and it creates the best coffee possible.
        

        Coffee is a tree, and you probably prefer one branch to another, even if you don't know it yet.
      

        There isnt one kind of coffee, theres a coffee family tree. For hundreds of years, humans have been cultivating, hybridizing and perfecting it, and today there are hundreds of types, or varieties.
      

        The variety of coffee tree matters—or at least, it usually does. Just as different types of grapes yield different wines, the variety of th
        e bean can have a profound impact on the finished cup. &#

El Jordan is a group of farmers who have partnered together to educate each other and raise the overall level of quality possible from Colombias Tolima region
This small-farmers focused co-op grows and processes coffee from a handful of villages that make up the Bies Penantan community.
Renovations to the dry mill here have been completed, enabling the co-op to continue its meticulous processing. 
Ibu Rahmah is the Chairwoman for Ketiara which prides itself upon remaining a female led cooperative that redefines what Indonesian coffee can be. Although they live in a strictly Muslim region, theyve had the freedom to establish a co-op that is producing some of Stumptowns most singular coffee. They are a perfect example of the incredible quality possible from Sumatra. Besides coffee, they farm avocado, orange, banana, pepper, ginger, turmeric and more. 
Indonesias Takengon and Bener Meriah districts are known for sometimes producing cloudy, muddy coffees with too much body. However, the beans produced by the Ketiara Cooperative have stunned us with their round, soft profiles. Although they use some very old-school techniques that are unique to Indonesia, they have struck the perfect balance between old and new.
This group of farmers came together in . Their incredible attention to detail, including soil quality and a painstaking wet-hulling process, allows the earthy funkiness of Indonesian coffee to live in a clean cup. Part of this process includes the removal of the parchment  the thin layer around the coffee bean   much earlier than our other producers.
Bies Penantan consists of coffee cultivated by farmers within the Bies Penantan community. Previously, Bies Penantan was considered one village, but now a handful of villages make up the Bies Penantan community. 
In ,  people established the Ketiara Cooperative. They restructured their cooperative two years later to focus on small farmers. Ibu Rahmah is the Chairwoman for Ketiara which prides itself upon remaining a cooperative led by women. Over  producers contributed to the lot, some of whom are ethnic Javanese women who became widowed and displaced after the civil war. They plant their coffee under Lamtoro trees integrated with their other staple crops. The entire membership of Ketiara splits evenly between Gayonese and Javanese.
The Ketiara Co-op understands the importance of preparing the land, cultivating seedlings, and pruning. After the harvest, farmers transport the cherry to be depulped, fermented and then the parchment covered beans are dried in the sun to about % moisture content. After they remove the parchment by hulling the beans (known as wet-hulling since the parchment retains so much moisture), the still wet beans are then dried in the sun for a second time (to about % moisture content). They then use a Sutton machine to sort the beans. Finally, they dry the beans one last time, hand sort the coffee for quality assurance, then pack it up for export.
In , Ketiara obtained Organic certification for the farmers in the Bies Penantan community. They renovated their entire mill and updated some of their processing equipment. They purchased new sorting equipment which improved the quality of the Bies Penantan lot. Their efforts produced a beautiful example of Sumatran coffee at its best.

The warm tartness of Fuji apple is balanced by sweet chocolate and vanilla spice. 

The co-op supports its  members through education and sustainability initiatives, maintains model and learning gardens, a coffee nursery, and a guinea pig farm (a food staple here) as part of a food security program. Were really excited about the growth weve seen so far and looking very forward to the future. 
A very remote area in Northern Peru with breathtaking landscapes that is a mecca for growing organic coffee. When we visit here, our producers always offer upon arrival a shot of homemade aguardiente, anise-flavored firewater booze that the locals make and store in plastic Coca-Cola liters. The coffee culture here is relatively new and the region is only just beginning to gain access to basic infrastructure, such as electricity and paved roads. For us, its worth the rugged trek  we find this region produces incredibly expressive organic coffees. 
A sleek and lightweight little powerhouse. The Porlex mini is a favorite around here to pack in our camp coffee kits. 
We love this grinder on-the-go with easy adjust grind. Hand grinders do take a little elbow grease, but burr is better!  (It will take about two minutes to grind coffee when full.)

Decaf shouldnt taste this good. But it does. In fact, it tastes great.
The sweetness of raisins pairs beautifully with caramel in this creamy, buttery cup.

We begin with meticulously sourced beans, choosing only those whose flavors and profiles can stand up to decaffeination. We make that process as gentle as possible with the Swiss Water Decaf process. Pioneered in the s, this is the only certifiably organic way to remove caffeine. This process instead relies on hot water, osmosis, and an activated charcoal filter.
The result is a decaffeinated bean that still carries its own flavors and aromas; our blend brings a lightly sweet but full-bodied experience, and makes an outstanding espresso or cup of drip.
A solid coffee kit to add to the camp kitchen, the Voyager has got your back. Pack it in  the Snow Peak produces a great brew, folds flat and only weighs four ounces.

				The BigStep refers to the design of the larger diameter 'stepped edge' measuring in at .mm. Perfect for VST filter baskets.			
The BigStep refers to the design of the larger diameter 'stepped edge' measuring in at .mm (+/-.mm). This increases the surface area of extractable coffee to be covered, including the prevention of a pinched edge of coffee grind that can occur when using such a large (or incorrectly) sized base. 

Mainly designed for ridgeless precision baskets ( Example, VST, IMS and Strada, Synesso and some LM baskets ). If unsure please ask us if the tamper base will fit your basket. This base is made from an extremely high strength (min  Rockwell)  Grade Stainless steel in Australia from premium grade materials. For Pullman's Barista Tamp devotees, the BigStep retains the feel of a regular Barista base and is designed with those in mind who perform a standard tamping technique. 
A perfect vertical movement must be applied with tamping including careful dose distribution. The base can be retrofitted to any pullman tamper handle.

							Ripe cherries are hand picked by local pickers. The pickers are paid extra to sort ripe cherries from the unripe while they are picking. Sorting is done by simply putting the cherries in separate bags.
After de-pulping the mucilage is removed with the use of a penagos aqua pulper. Then the parchment is fermented for  hours before it is washed using african washing techniques which helps sorting floaters and undeveloped beans from the denser and more developed coffee. After washing, the beans are soaked for about  hours in running clean water. Then the coffee gets dried slowly on raised beds covered with shade nets.						
We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our light roasted coffees are suited for all brew methods except espresso. The roast level gives a cup with clarity, brightness and sweetness with little  bitterness and ashy flavors from the roast process.

If brewed as espresso on an espresso machine, the lighter roast style will result in a cup with a very high level of acidity due to the highly concentrated brew. We therefore recommend using our slightly darker roasted coffees for making espresso.
All our coffees are packed in vacuum sealed, recyclable plastic bags that are flushed with nitrogen before seal- ing. The bags has a one way valve to let the coffee de-gas while quality is kept in the sealed bag.

When the coffee is roasted it develops a lot of CO gas inside the beans. This gas will make the coffee taste smokey and ashy immediately after roasting. It is abso- lutely crucial to let the coffee degas and rest for a while before use to ensure maximum flavour.

We recommend storing / degassing our ligher roasted coffees for minimum  to  days after the date of roast , sealed in the original bag at room temperature, before you use it.

Make sure you store it in a dark place at around C - C, away from any heat, moisture or light. The coffee has lost most of its sweetness and aroma - weeks after the day of roast, so make sure you use it before it is too late.

You can find the roast date and batch number on all our coffees in the bottom right corner of the front label on the bags. 
We strongly recommend to use correct measurments and brewing techniques when you brew our coffees. Use a digital scale both to measure water and coffee in order to get consistent results.

We recommend to use between  to  grams of coffee per litre (g) of water, depending on the brewing method, water quality and coffee used.

 We have been part of developing the Oslo cup series from Figgjo together with designer Kristin Hærnes Ihlen from Physical Design and Figgjo. Therte are three different cups in the series. All made to enhance the drinking experience:
"Tulipan" (Tulip) is designed for coffees with lower acidity like typical Bourbons from El Salvador, Brazil or Indian coffees. The cone shaped cup enhances more earthy aromas and gives you an impression that the coffee is very sweet as the liquid enters the mouth in a narrow stream and hits the middle of the tongue.
"Splitt" is designed for coffees with intense fruity and floral aromas and bright acidity. Typically we use these cups for our Kenyan and Ethiopian coffees. The unique design enhances the aromatics when you smell the coffee in the cup and the wide shape makes the liquid enter your mouth with a wider spread so that you percieve acidity more clearly.
 "Åpen" (open) is more of an allround cup. The classic U-shape is a forgiving shape when it comes to taste balance yet it has the ability to intensify aromas when you smell the coffees. We typically use these cups for coffees that has fruity characters and medium intense acidity. 
The fun part is that you can play around with the different shapes with different coffees and change your guests perception of how the coffees taste like.

							The coffee is selectively hand picked by hired pickers under
supervision of Elias. Cherries are hand sorted before they are
processed to make sure only ripe cherries are processed together.
After depulping the parchment coffee is rinsed in clean water.
Then the water is drained and the parchment is fermented for
 to  hours. After fermentation the coffee is washed in clean
water that is changed  times. All oaters are removed during
the washing. The Parchment is soaked for  hours in clean
water before it is dried in parabolic dryers under shade from  -  days.						
We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our espresso roasts are similar to our light roasts but are developed slightly more in order to reduce the intensity of acidity when brewed as espresso. This roast will give you slightly more bitter notes when brewed as a filter coffee. 
We strongly recommend to use VST filterbaskets. Both the g, g and the g basket is great for our coffee.

The VST filters makes it a lot easier to extract the espresso properly which gives a lot more sweetness in the cup. They are also more or less identical to eachother which makes it easy to be more consistent when brewing on several groups at the same time.
You can buy the filters here. Just make sure they fit your machine. (Fits all La Marzocco machines and machines with mm filter baskets)

With the VST  gram filterbasket, we recommend the following brewing parameters:

   grams freshly ground coffee
   seconds brewing time
   grams of final brew liquid in the cup
C  C brew water temperature

							The coffee is hand picked by the farmers and their families. After delivering the coffee to the wet mill the good coffee cherries are separated from the inferior ones. The cherries are depulped and graded by using an old disc de-pulper that uses water and gravity to sort dense beans from less dense beans. The beans are dry fermented for about - hours over night in one tank, then transported to a second tank with water where the fermentation is finished. This prevents the coffee from over fermenting. After fermentation the coffee is washed and graded in the evening before it gets soaked over night for about  hours. After soaking the coffee is dried on african elevated drying tables, where defect parchment coffee gets sorted out. The coffee is dried to a moisture between -% and stored in conditioning bins before delivery to the dry mill.						
We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our light roasted coffees are suited for all brew methods except espresso. The roast level gives a cup with clarity, brightness and sweetness with little  bitterness and ashy flavors from the roast process.

If brewed as espresso on an espresso machine, the lighter roast style will result in a cup with a very high level of acidity due to the highly concentrated brew. We therefore recommend using our slightly darker roasted coffees for making espresso.
All our coffees are packed in vacuum sealed, recyclable plastic bags that are flushed with nitrogen before seal- ing. The bags has a one way valve to let the coffee de-gas while quality is kept in the sealed bag.

When the coffee is roasted it develops a lot of CO gas inside the beans. This gas will make the coffee taste smokey and ashy immediately after roasting. It is abso- lutely crucial to let the coffee degas and rest for a while before use to ensure maximum flavour.

We recommend storing / degassing our ligher roasted coffees for minimum  to  days after the date of roast , sealed in the original bag at room temperature, before you use it.

Make sure you store it in a dark place at around C - C, away from any heat, moisture or light. The coffee has lost most of its sweetness and aroma - weeks after the day of roast, so make sure you use it before it is too late.

You can find the roast date and batch number on all our coffees in the bottom right corner of the front label on the bags. 
We strongly recommend to use correct measurments and brewing techniques when you brew our coffees. Use a digital scale both to measure water and coffee in order to get consistent results.

We recommend to use between  to  grams of coffee per litre (g) of water, depending on the brewing method, water quality and coffee used.

Roasters Notes: This one continues to delight us all.  For the uninitiated, monsooning is a kind of curing or aging that produces huge, bold, punchy coffees with very low acidity.  Unfortunately, monsooning is a tricky process and can easily produce coffee with unpleasant musty or hessian-y taints, or, if the acidity is completely eliminated, can produce a coffee that just seems dead and flat in the cup.Our Aspinwall is the only IMM weve found that is consistently clean and as close to delicate as a monsooned coffee can get, with maple syrup and spice notes and that light-but-not-imperceptible acidity to lift it up. And then, of course, down below is that gigantic, velvety body that punches through milk and doesnt even mind a bit of sugar. Incongruous and mesmerising, like watching a hippo dance ballet. And who wouldnt want to watch that?Aroma: Maple Syrup, SpiceFlavours: Molasses, Maple Syrup, Intense, Very Heavy Body, Low AcidityCountry of Origin: IndiaRegion: Malabar CoastGrowing Altitude:  MASLVarieties: Kent, S, CauweryHarvest and processing: Washed, Monsooned

Roasters Notes: A classic Kenyan with a little extra punch, Malimbe is rich and big-bodied, with aromas of orange peel and bourbon along with a long, cocoa finish. Big enough for milk but also complex and well-balanced for black, Malimbe is one of our favourites and we’re excited to be able to offer it again. Full, rich tones of toffee, chocolate and bourbon at the bottom end are matched by distinct notes of citrus and blackberry on top.
