The coffees we end up bringing to Vancouver are the result of determination and passion from the farmers and all parties along the supply chain working to preserve that initial hard work.
The people we work with are up at the crack of dawn, tirelessly working towards a plentiful and sweet harvest. They are vibrant members of their communities. We love working with them.
We visit each of our producer partners as often as we can (annually is the norm for us), and communicate throughout the year.
We collaborate too. Financing Martirs dryer is one example. When they grow, we grow with them. If you want to know the nitty gritty, check out our Transparency Update.

Here are the parameters that we've been using with Blue Sky Espresso(parameters for an g VST Precision Filter Basket)
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
Simple and extremely helpful for the cyclists among us.
No screws, no glue. A fool proof steel spring design.

There are many beautiful coffees hiding in Valle del Cauca, and Rubiels is especially great. Hes been delivering lots to our exporter partners for the last two and a half years, and each lot has been consistent: sweet, clean, with delicious fruit flavours. This year, we get to have quite a bit of his production, and hopefully even more next harvest.
Castillo has become synonymous with Colombia in the past few decades, with most of the countrys five hundred thousand producer families getting incentive to switch their original Caturra or other varieties to Castillo - a hearty Catimor hybrid with various strains developed by the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation. This made for a switch en masse, making for the fastest and largest change in varieties that coffee has ever seen in a single country. Whatever particular strain Rubiel has, its working for him.
This years La Montaa is complex - Sweet and floral with peach acidity, and flavours of orange, vanilla and soft refreshing cardamom in the finish.
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
Our coffee is decaffeinated at the Descafecol plant in Manizales, Colombia by using a specialized "combination procedure" utilizing water and ethyl acetate derived from sugar cane molasses. Ethyl acetate is an ester that is found naturally in several fruits and vegetables and Manizales is known for its many sugar cane plantations, making great use of a local product. Ethyl acetate's low boiling point enables a gentle caffeine extraction from the coffee bean, while pressure or excessive heat treatment are avoided and the natural structure of the green coffee bean cells are retained.
The Los Idolos producers group got together with the desire of obtaining a high income through the sale of high quality coffee. The name Los Idolos, was chosen because of its symbolism and as a way of honouring the region's ancestral origins. So far, the group has focused on standardizing practices and improving their wet mills and drying patios, slowly and steadily increasing quality.
Here are the parameters that we've been using with our latest Decaf Colombia Los Idolos(parameters for an g VST Precision Filter Basket)
If you're looking for an incredibly sweet, clean espresso with floral notes and bright acidity, this is definitely for you. Epic is roasted on the lighter side to highlight these characteristics.
Epic Espresso is the culmination of our search for the sweetest and most complex espresso we can create. We work every day to improve it - always looking for the perfect balance of sweetness and acidity.
Here are the parameters that we've been using with our latest Epic Espresso (parameters for an g VST Precision Filter Basket)
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
The region of La Libertad is a place that we cant fully capture - rolling hills turn into the huge sweeping, lush green mountains overlooking the border into the Chiapas region of Mexico. Warm winds sweep in from the Tehuantepec plain, protecting the coffee in the highlands from frost - how nice of Mexico! 
Special coffees grow here. The micro climate and production is exceptional at La Bolsa (which has been in the Vides/ Ovalle family since ), but especially the section of the farm that our lot is comprised of. Ventana Grande means big window - the highest elevated part of the farm is entered through a tunnel in the mountain, opening like a window to the Bourbon and Caturra lot that ripens the slowest, and consequently yields the sweetest fruit. It's thefamilys continuous focus on quality, and their sense of social responsibility (they maintain a full school, and access to healthcare for the local community), that make us excited towork with La Bolsa for yet another year.
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
Ramon is producing a small quantity, but high quality coffee on El Cedral mountain, neighbouring El Cielito in Santa Barbara, surrounding Yojoa Lake. Ramon is no stranger to specialty coffee, having been awarded as a finalist in the prestigious Cup of Excellence competition in previous years.
We are excited to share Ramon's coffee as our Holiday Espresso this year. With floral aroma and flavours of orange zest, nuts and ripe pear it was an obvious choice for our holiday feature and has us feeling festive and warm.
Here are the parameters that we've been using with Holiday Espresso(parameters for an g VST Precision Filter Basket)
In , Natividad was rewarded with st place in the prestigious Cup of Excellence program and has since worked consistently towards maintaining quality and creating a sustainable farm forhimself and his family. 
The area of El Cielito is close to the micro regions of El Cedral, Las Flores and El Sauce where we work with several producers of similar size and quality as Natividad. Since last year, Natividads focus has been on maintaining quality through a period of growth on his farm, with additional Pacas plots coming into full production. There arent many smallholder farmers we know who take as much care over cash flow and finance to support both quality of life and the coffee when operating a farm of this size ( hectares at this point) - Its inspiring and encouraging to see, and it translates in part to why we look forward to this coffee every year. We know its going to be good.
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
Martir has a stunning looking crop this year, much of it Yellow Catuai, a variety that is more difficult to pick than its red version of this cultivar. In order for yellow catuai to be deemed ripe, it must be yellow but with a small pink blush, indicating there are lots of sugars in the fruit, ready to be picked and processed.
Martirs main goals for this past season has revolved around first ripe picking, and then maintaining the drying protocols we worked on together last season. Together in February-March , we collaborated on a modest study related to drying the coffee and shelf life of the finished exportable green coffee. We monitored a portion of his production at specific times over the entire drying cycle, and recorded relative humidity and temperature inside the dryer. The dryers were retrofit to help provide some shade during times of hot and bright midday sun. This helped to preserve the quality of the harvest.
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
Karimikui is part of a trio of factories located along the southern slopes of Mount Kenya. More often than not, Kirinyaga as a region has been in the shadow of the legendary Nyeri county - that is clearly no longer the case.
The Rungeto cooperative was created back in , and between Karimikui, and the other two factories involved in the society, the yields and quality are so great that it stands as an excellent example of a cooperative society doing well.
We are excited to release this smooth and balanced coffee as a single origin espresso.
Here are the parameters that we've been using with Kenya Karimikui AA(parameters for an g VST Precision Filter Basket)
At the foothills of the Aberdare mountain range, the catchment area of Kigwandi has fantastic growing conditions. Loamy claysoil,  -  meters above seal level where the coffee is grown,and with massive biodiversity as the altitude increase to over  meters at the summit.
Kigwandi began work as a cooperative with the / harvestalliedwith the Tetu co-op society.Kigwandi eventually left the Tetu cooperative society to form Mutheka Farmer's Cooperative society in  along with other well performing factories like neighbouring Chorongi.
Possibly the most vibrantamongour Kenyan releases this year, Kigwandi oozes juicy raspberry with theacidity and sweetness of a fresh wildflower honey and rosehip. So good.
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
This is a tribute to traditional espresso. Pacific North West Style.
Old School Espresso is roasted in the medium/dark range to highlight the sweetness and body in the coffee.
Old School Espresso is ideal for those who prefer low acidity and full body. Dark chocolate aroma with round flavours of cocoa, caramel and molasses.
Here are the parameters that we've been using with our latest Old School Espresso (parameters for an g VST Precision Filter Basket):
Our Organic French Roast is ideal for those who prefer the taste of dark roasted coffee.
This dark roast coffee highlights a smoky, powerful, and spicy flavour. This heavy coffee will delight with a nutty and caramel aftertaste. The low acidity of this rich coffee is perfect for stove top espresso or as filter coffee.
For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:

Swiss Water Process involves first soaking the coffee in pure water. The green coffee extract that results is then passed through a carbon filter, specifically engineered to filter out the caffeine molecule. The green coffee extract is then introduced to the coffee but without the caffeine. This process is simple in theory, but impressive to execute, since the coffee has to be dried and preserved in an exacting way to ensure the inherent flavour of the coffee remains relatively unscathed.
Great as both a filter, and an espresso, the cup profile is sweet, and subtle with flavours of cocoa, and caramel.
Here are the parameters that we've been using with our latest Swiss Water Process(parameters for an g VST Precision Filter Basket)
These coffeesare the result ofnearly thousands of samples cupped, and many miles logged. It's the result of multi year commitments by producers to grow, pick, and process exciting coffees. Enjoy!

After five years of partnerships with the Pacas Family weve learned that good things are on the horizon when they acquire a new farm. Los Bellotos, one of their most recent farms, is no exception. With the help of farm manager Ruperto Bernardino Merche we were able to separate El Gorrion from the highest reaches of Los Bellotos. The trees here are planted further apart than usual with their branches pulled down and arched towards the sun for maximum exposure and nutrients. This practice is known as the Agobahia Technique and is one of the many reasons this coffee shines.
The El Gorrion is another strong crowd pleaser. The % washed bourbon is lively and rich with flavor notes of pineapple, guava, and rose blossom.

When Coava Coffee Roasters began packaging coffee by the kilogram in  our intention was twofold: First: Our roaster has been designed to operate most efficiently by the kilogram. By sticking to the metric system and maintaining strict roast cycles, weve been able to reduce our waste to less than one pound of coffee per week. This careful planning is another way we show respect for the work of the coffee producers we represent. Second: Roasting by the kilogram allows us to package our coffees in  gram increments. Known as the Coava , our retail bags promote freshness, dissuade waste, and divide evenly with most brew methods. It is the perfect quantity for the average coffee drinker.
To show respect for the full chain of quality coffee (sourcing, roasting, preparing) we do not offer any blends. Our coffees carry the names of the co-ops and individual farmers who harvest, process, and prepare them for us. We commit to show honor where honor is due.
We only partner with producers who are mindful of their people, their environment, and their crop. The farms we work with take great care of their coffee from seedling to harvest, through processing and storing, and finally in packaging. It is through these sustainable partnerships that we ensure the longevity of the coffee beans and the final quality in the cup.
We only work with the best importers and exporters. Their transparency, care for the farmers, and quality of transportation and storage of our coffees is absolutely essential. These partners are rarely heralded, but hold our industry together. Once the coffees arrive in Portland we move them directly into our green room. This temperature controlled room combines several proprietary practices and ensures that all of the work done before us is kept intact.
b: an occupation or trade requiring manual dexterity or artistic skill
Coava travels the world in pursuit of coffees with the highest quality, complexity, and balance. We take an exhaustive hands-on approach to coffee as an agricultural process. Dedicating ourselves to learning about soil conditions, sustainable farming practices, varietal mutations, and plant diseases are only a few of the areas of specialty that have helped us source outstanding coffees.
Each year, we spend months at origin courting the most conscientious coffee producers. We use our resources to build better processing facilities, introduce the best preservation practices, and spotlight individual farmers. We also collaborate with coffee mills to buy a farmers full harvest. This stands in opposition to the common practice of only purchasing parts of the harvest and leaving the farmer with the harder-to-sell remnants. Our rare approach ensures the purchase of an entire farms production at a higher price. We still get the top-tier separations, but weve also found a home for the rest of the coffees with the local coffee mill.
We make these efforts to establish mutually beneficial partnerships with the men and women producing the coffees we adore.
We are committed to the inherent qualities within each unroasted coffee. We strive to compose beautiful roast profiles that highlight the tremendous work that has been performed by the coffee producers each harvest. We never blend coffees and whenever possible we name them after the farmers who grow them. We are constantly tasting, documenting, and reevaluating our profiles to ensure that we enable individual coffees to shine.
After everything has been said and done Coava is rooted in preparing exceptional beverages. Our passion for balanced & sweet espresso, perfect milk drinks, and delicious brewed coffee brings our baristas together as craftsmen. We push for consistent excellence by refining our skills through palate calibration, systematic preparation, and self-critique. This dedication has earned our team many first place honors in the Barista Competitions.
a: given to general and cordial reception of guests
At Coavas core is the desire to share the delicious coffees that we are excited about. We never dreamed that the pursuit of such a simple goal would surround us with all of the incredible people that make up the Coava family. From our shops dedicated regulars to coffee lovers around the globe, we enjoy coffee together. Weve danced and celebrated, barbequed and tinkered, but also dug in deep and supported one another.
In similar fashion we would not be who we are without great partnerships. We problem solve harvest and processing issues alongside farmers. We help coffee shops all over the United States open, build up, and expand their businesses. We raise money and resources alongside non-profits to benefit our community. With these amazing partners Coava has been honored to grow, learn, and succeed.
b: northwest coffee roaster notoriously fueled by good folks and Led Zeppelin
Coava began in Matt Higgins garage in . The veteran barista and roaster bootstrapped the company by repairing motorcycles. His ambitions were to one day roast and prepare coffees that would be exciting for baristas and inviting to everyday drinkers. To do this, Matt knew that sourcing excellent "coava" would have to be the anchor of everything he did.
So he studied agriculture, farm practices, and sustainable business. He learned from everyone that he could and at the first chance he began traveling to the major coffee growing regions. He sought farmers whose careful work was producing quality crops with the type of complexity and balance that many single origin coffees didn't have at the time. His willingness to do what others would not eventually earned him a reputation among coffee producers as a respectful, diligent, and honest man. Those early years were adventurous and difficult, but laid the foundation for the many long-standing partnerships Coava has with farmers today.
With great coffees in hand, Coava began sharing them through a handful of Pacific Northwest coffeehouses. These early believers led the way for Coava to open our brew bar and roastery in southeast Portland in . We are indebted to and thankful for their support on this journey.
#coavainsight: The word Coava was introduced by William Biddulph to the western world in  in The Travels of a Certayne Englishmen in Africa, Asia, etc... Begunne in  and By Some of Them Finished-this Yeere .

On New Years Day we woke up at Ryan the roasters house. Some people were getting antsy to wade through the rain to a caf or bar or something, but Ryan the roaster wasnt having it. Its nice and warm here, he said.Lets all just take our shirts off, and relax.
Thats how we got the idea for this subscription. We want everyone to stay home, take their shirts off, and relax. We also ship to offices, where you can enjoy all the benefits of our subscription program except for the part about staying home, removing your shirt, and relaxing.
No matter where you are, the single origin subscription gets you a different coffee from a single origin (like a certain farm in Guatemala or co-op in Ethiopia) each delivery. We choose; you enjoy. The espresso subscription gets you either Friendo Blendo or a single origin espresso each delivery. We choose; you enjoy. We roast; you relax. Need more blends? Get down with our brothers and sisters at De La Paz.
Fellow club member, there's just one more step. Meet us over in the CART for the initiation ceremony.

Cupping notes : DeepSmokiness,Browned Butter,Caramel
Roast level : Dark
We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as bakers chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.

To drink a cup of Ethiopia Nigusse Lemma is to connect with the origins of coffee. Beans from Ethiopias Limu woreda (district) deliver unique flavors that can only be discovered in heirloom varietals. Located in the southwestern part of country, Limu is not as well known as Yirgacheffe or Harrar, but deserves the attention that it is receiving.
Our Ethiopia Niguisse Lemma is sourced from the family farm of Lemma Edeto and is located in the highest elevations of the Limu region. Shade from old growth trees, water from spring fed stream, and native varietal of coffee that flourish organically are in no better hands than the Edeto Family. Lemma, with over  years in the coffee industry, has passed down the knowledge to his sons Nigusse and Haile, who operate the farm which their father recovered after it was confiscated by the Derg regime in the s. The familys commitment to quality includes a fully natural dry processing that insures no unripend cherries taint the taste of the finished product. Fully control from farming to milling has resulted in award-winning coffee. Nigusse and family were recently honored for the African Taste of the Harvest competition awarded by the African Fine Coffee Association.

The most common source of fuel used to supply a coffee roaster with heat is gas. We are, however, the first and only roaster in the United States to roast coffee beans exclusively over a fire fueled by Oak Wood. The differences are not what one might initially expect. Unlike cooking with a wood oven or grill, where the smoke from the wood imparts a flavor to the final product, the main difference between wood and conventional roasting lies in the quality of the heat delivered to the beans. Heat derived from wood has higher moisture content and is better suited for slow roasting.
The more oil preserved within the bean, the more exquisite the final flavor will be. The natural humidity within the wood seems to envelop the beans during the roasting process, hence preserving more of the lipids within. Meanwhile, the slow roasting aspect ensures the coffee is lower in acidity and higher in body. The result is most apparent in our espresso, yielding more crema, fuller flavor, and a smoother finish. For drip coffee for which we actually wish to retain the acidity of the coffees, we subject the beans to a faster roasting time.
The unique advantages of wood roasting do not come without challenges, as the use of such an inconsistent fuel (i.e. wood) creates difficulties in maintaining consistency between roasts. A nightmare for an inexperienced operator, years of experience of roasting with wood are required to develop the intuition and instinct necessary to master the process. Luckily for us, with  years of wood roasting under our belt, we are able to claim this as an advantage; since through the unpredictable nature of roasting with wood, we are required to be attentive and obsessive with each and every roast: nothing can replace the skilled guidance of our experienced roasters. However, never the ones to be overconfident, we still go through extra steps to ensure consistency and quality.
We begin by selecting well seasoned wood from responsible suppliers. We then utilize thermocouple data collected at key locations on the roaster along with VFD motor control, which allows to make fan and drum speed adjustments during the roasting process. The wood smoke emissions are then abated by high powered afterburners which are in full compliance with local air quality standards. Combining these tools with our years of experience, we are able to maintain control of the roasting process with a very high level of consistency. As you can see, wood roasting is an artisan craft where human experience using old world methods, combined with the latest technological advances in roasting, delicately blend art and science. We hope you will enjoy a distinctive coffee experience which is impossible to duplicate.

			A great single origin is a truly exceptional coffee that highlights the intrinsic qualities of that region while being able to stand on its own as a unique and enjoyable cup of coffee.

To drink a cup of Ethiopia Nigusse Lemma is to connect with the origins of coffee. Beans from Ethiopias Limu woreda (district) deliver unique flavors that can only be discovered in heirloom varietals. Located in the southwestern part of country, Limu is not as well known as Yirgacheffe or Harrar, but deserves the attention that it is receiving.
Our Ethiopia Niguisse Lemma is sourced from the family farm of Lemma Edeto and is located in the highest elevations of the Limu region. Shade from old growth trees, water from spring fed stream, and native varietal of coffee that flourish organically are in no better hands than the Edeto Family. Lemma, with over  years in the coffee industry, has passed down the knowledge to his sons Nigusse and Haile, who operate the farm which their father recovered after it was confiscated by the Derg regime in the s. The familys commitment to quality includes a fully natural dry processing that insures no unripend cherries taint the taste of the finished product. Fully control from farming to milling has resulted in award-winning coffee. Nigusse and family were recently honored for the African Taste of the Harvest competition awarded by the African Fine Coffee Association.

He not only grows sustenance crops such as maize and beans, he has also created a small nature reserve that provides a nesting site for the Colombian chachalaca. This turkey-like, native bird is not endangered but has seen a continual declining population. It is Maximinos commitment to give back to the land that has been so generous to him.
El Diviso is a complex coffee withcinnamon and milk chocolate aromas, mandarin and meyer lemon acidity andsmooth cashew butter undertones.

Talk about Berries and Spice and everything nice for the holidays. In addition to our Joyeux Holiday Blend you should definitely take a ride with this beautiful Ecuador from Eduardo Romo.
Ecuador has great potential and is one of my favorite origins for being exotic but also having the quality to back it up; the big issue we see at the moment is volume. The country as a whole only exports  containers/year (, lbs/container) of Washed Arabica. Caf Imports alone moves more than  containers/year. The rest of the coffee Ecuador produces is low quality Naturals and Robusta to sustain its huge instant coffee market for internal consumption and exports. To put this into perspective:
The producers in this area still have traditional varieties such as Typica, Caturra, and Bourbon, which has been key to their success. Rust has been an issue for most of these producers and having organic certification limits the products you can apply to your farm making it tougher.
The microclimate in this area is very particular. It is very wet almost year-round and has good temperature fluctuations from  -  degrees Celsius with an average of  degrees. This weather is ideal for coffee growing and it reflects in the cup.
The South of Ecuador has smallholders with . hectares on average. While in the North we see larger farms.
Typical Southern farms will be organic and extremely diverse with flowers, corn, cabbages, bananas, bees, cows, fish, fruits, and coffee. A big challenge these farmers are facing at the moment is leaf rust. This decimated plantations in Colombia bringing their production down % in a couple of years. The easiest solution for leaf-rust is intensive chemical applications but their respect for the environment makes them take the harder organic route. Also, plant nutrition in Ecuador is extremely low due to little fertilization. This affects cup quality and yields from parchment to green coffee.
Farms in the North are bigger, at  hectares or more. They use conventional fertilizers and are in better shape in general; the area is extremely lush and in very moist conditions with a nice warm summer creating good conditions for growing coffee. This area is extremely interesting, you will find: ancient indigenous tombs, a vineyard, and an experimental variety farm ran by NESPRESSO.
Tell someone that you care enough about them, to want to give them the gift of great coffee, as well as the knowledge to make it well at home. The Populace Holiday Bundle comes with a g bag of Joyeux Holiday Blend, and a Habitual: A Coffee Brewing Guide. Free shipping as always, with all of our coffee, this bundle is a "can't miss".

Our favorite friend from Sulawesi is back and better than ever. This coffee is like a lemon bar covered in toffee.
Region: Pango Pango, TorajaFarm: VariousVarietal:SAltitude: - MASLProcessing Method:Fully Washed and Sundried
Sulawesi (formerly Celebes), was influenced and controlled by the Netherlands from  until World War II. In , the Dutch East India Company took control of the trade in Sulawesi. The Dutch built Fort Rotterdam in Ujung Pandang (now Makassar) in the mid s, and gained full control of the island in , making it part of the Dutch state colony of the Netherlands East Indies. The Dutch East India Company was in control of coffee production in Indonesia during most the s and introduced Arabica Coffee (Typica) to Sulawesi in .
It took some time for our buyers to arrive in Tana Toraja, Sulawesi, from Minneapolis, having to travel from Minneapolis to Tokyo, then Singapore, a stop in Jakarta, then land in Makassar and drive eight hours north to Rantepao, Tana Toraja. It is the most beautiful place on earth: green, lush, and rice paddies everywhere, giving it a sense of calmness. Traditional Tongkonan houses cover the background with fascinating Toraja Patterns decorating the structures.
Indonesian coffee has traditionally been processed with thegiling-basahmethod, or wet-hulled, like in Sumatra. In  TOARCO, a Japanese-Indonesian joint-venture, introduced to Sulawesi the traditional washed-process, similar to that of Central America.
TOARCO ownsPedamaran Plantationat  meters, and purchases wet-parchment (at % moisture) from small producers at  meters. Coffee is trucked to Pedamaran Plantation immediately after purchase, and coffee gets dried on mechanical Yamamoto vertical dryers. Mr Watanabe, a TOARCO and Key Coffee veteran, had his origin training in Colombia with the FNC and has always respected their approach to coffee production. TOARCO is now testing out Colombian Penagos horizontal dryers or guardiolas.
If a producer wants to sell their parchment coffee to TOARCO, they need to get certified to the quality standards as far as selective picking, storage, transportation, moisture levels, etc. Farmers are issued ID cards that allow them to sell their coffee at various purchasing points in the Tana Toraja region during the market week. Caf Imports coffee comes from small producers at the higher altitude areas.
Most of the coffee produced in Toraja is S variety, developed in India to be resistant to leaf rust. The genetics of this variety is Typica and Liberica; even though it has Liberica (Robusta-esque species) genes we've seen + and + cups in these coffees.

Sulawesi (formerly Celebes), was influenced and controlled by the Netherlands from  until World War II. In , the Dutch East India Company took control of the trade in Sulawesi. The Dutch built Fort Rotterdam in Ujung Pandang (now Makassar) in the mid s, and gained full control of the island in , making it part of the Dutch state colony of the Netherlands East Indies. The Dutch East India Company was in control of coffee production in Indonesia during most the s and introduced Arabica Coffee (Typica) to Sulawesi in .
It took some time for our buyers to arrive in Tana Toraja, Sulawesi, from Minneapolis, having to travel from Minneapolis to Tokyo, then Singapore, a stop in Jakarta, then land in Makassar and drive eight hours north to Rantepao, Tana Toraja. It is the most beautiful place on earth: green, lush, and rice paddies everywhere, giving it a sense of calmness. Traditional Tongkonan houses cover the background with fascinating Toraja Patterns decorating the structures.
Indonesian coffee has traditionally been processed with thegiling-basahmethod, or wet-hulled, like in Sumatra. In  TOARCO, a Japanese-Indonesian joint-venture, introduced to Sulawesi the traditional washed-process, similar to that of Central America.
TOARCO ownsPedamaran Plantationat  meters, and purchases wet-parchment (at % moisture) from small producers at  meters. Coffee is trucked to Pedamaran Plantation immediately after purchase, and coffee gets dried on mechanical Yamamoto vertical dryers. Mr Watanabe, a TOARCO and Key Coffee veteran, had his origin training in Colombia with the FNC and has always respected their approach to coffee production. TOARCO is now testing out Colombian Penagos horizontal dryers or guardiolas.
If a producer wants to sell their parchment coffee to TOARCO, they need to get certified to the quality standards as far as selective picking, storage, transportation, moisture levels, etc. Farmers are issued ID cards that allow them to sell their coffee at various purchasing points in the Tana Toraja region during the market week. Caf Imports coffee comes from small producers at the higher altitude areas.
Most of the coffee produced in Toraja is S variety, developed in India to be resistant to leaf rust. The genetics of this variety is Typica and Liberica; even though it has Liberica (Robusta-esque species) genes we've seen + and + cups in these coffees.

Talk about Berries and Spice and everything nice for the holidays. In addition to our Joyeux Holiday Blend you should definitely take a ride with this beautiful Ecuador from Eduardo Romo.
Ecuador has great potential and is one of my favorite origins for being exotic but also having the quality to back it up; the big issue we see at the moment is volume. The country as a whole only exports  containers/year (, lbs/container) of Washed Arabica. Caf Imports alone moves more than  containers/year. The rest of the coffee Ecuador produces is low quality Naturals and Robusta to sustain its huge instant coffee market for internal consumption and exports. To put this into perspective:
The producers in this area still have traditional varieties such as Typica, Caturra, and Bourbon, which has been key to their success. Rust has been an issue for most of these producers and having organic certification limits the products you can apply to your farm making it tougher.
The microclimate in this area is very particular. It is very wet almost year-round and has good temperature fluctuations from  -  degrees Celsius with an average of  degrees. This weather is ideal for coffee growing and it reflects in the cup.
The South of Ecuador has smallholders with . hectares on average. While in the North we see larger farms.
Typical Southern farms will be organic and extremely diverse with flowers, corn, cabbages, bananas, bees, cows, fish, fruits, and coffee. A big challenge these farmers are facing at the moment is leaf rust. This decimated plantations in Colombia bringing their production down % in a couple of years. The easiest solution for leaf-rust is intensive chemical applications but their respect for the environment makes them take the harder organic route. Also, plant nutrition in Ecuador is extremely low due to little fertilization. This affects cup quality and yields from parchment to green coffee.
Farms in the North are bigger, at  hectares or more. They use conventional fertilizers and are in better shape in general; the area is extremely lush and in very moist conditions with a nice warm summer creating good conditions for growing coffee. This area is extremely interesting, you will find: ancient indigenous tombs, a vineyard, and an experimental variety farm ran by NESPRESSO.

The factory is run by a manager and  permanent staff members, plus - seasonal casual staff.
While the Crop here increases year to year the Co-op struggles with stability ass many farmer tend to concentrate on tea rather than coffee because prices are not so good. Management is encouraging the farmers by giving them farm inputs and other incentives like School fee loans and feild training to participate in coffee growing and increase their production and quality.
In line with the rising awareness on the need to conserve the environment the factory has initiated a couple of projects. Among these are the waste water Seepage pits, of which the factory has three

We are happy to introduce to you a new group called: "Aromas del Sur located in Palestina, Huila. We are working together with Aromas del Sur to bring to you the best coffees from Palestina.

Harvest starts in October and peak harvest is in November;mitaca("fly crop") is May and peak mitaca is in June. Producers harvest and mill their coffee following quality standards: They do a selective hand picking of ripe cherry, ferment the coffee to adequate level, and dry the coffee between .% moisture content. The common practice is that the producers mill the coffee at their own farm, and once coffee is dried to the desire moisture content, it's transferred to Aromas del Sur's warehouse.
Aromas del Sur has a project called Universidad del Caf (coffee university), the focus of which is to teach and implement quality procedures among the group's producers. The goal of the project is to train the producers in agricultural practices, commercial know-how, and cupping ability.
Aromas del Sur's warehouse functions as a storage place for parchment coffee, and has a well-equipped cupping lab for quality control. Each lot is cupped get the coffee profile and to check the quality.

This process is known as E.A. Sugarcane. It starts by fermenting molasses to create ethanol and combining it with acetic acidfound in vinegarto make ethyl acetate. This is added to water, and applied to the green coffee to dissolve the caffeine completely out of the beans. The caffeine is separated from the greens and is steamed and washed with more water.
This is truly an exceptional cup of coffee with flavors of citrus, caramel, and honey.
We developed this blend to please all palettes. It is comprised of % Kenya and % Colombia.
Our hope with this coffee is that it can be shared amongst family and friends without worry.
Our Espresso Clutch is a constant rotation of seasonal coffee. These coffees are chosen to fit into our flavor profile. Espresso Clutch has been with us since the beginning and is constantly evolving. We truly hope you enjoy.

Weve had the pleasure of working with the Desarrollo producer group in the town of Gigante, Colombia, for a number of years now, so were happy to announce the launch of Los Gigantes Decaf.
 In an effort to create a decaf that matches the caliber of our regular offerings, we pre-selected coffees with a bright and sweet profile before they are sent to bedecaffeinated.At the Descafecol plant in Manizales, the caffeine is removed using naturally occurring Ethyl Acetatederived from sugar cane. You'll find Ethyl Acetate in green coffee as well as various fruits, and it is the most common ester in wine.
The resulting coffee is intensely sweet and fruited both in aroma and flavor: banana bread, preserved cherries, and chocolate pudding.
For our fourth consecutive year, we have eagerly awaitedthe fresh arrival of Ethiopian coffee from the Hama Cooperative of the Gedeo Zone. Hama is part of a larger union of cooperatives in Kochere and neighboring Yirgacheffe, collected under the Yirgacheffe Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union, or YCFCU.
It was in consultation withTakele Mammo, the head of the Union, that we connected with the coffees and producers from Hama during a visit in . Grown at elevations between - meters, this coffee is prepared for export in the traditional washed method, with a long underwater fermentation followed by a post-fermentation soak. The coffee is dried on raised beds and hand sorted to Grade  specifications.
The resulting coffee, once roasted, presents an unusually floral cup with highlights of fruit driven acidity and sweetness. Complex and perfumed, with flavors of lilac, lavender and white grape.
Need a quick and thoughtful gift for a host (or just want to treat yourself)? This sweet duo is just the thing:
The Classic Ritual Mug or a Pillarbox Red Falcon Enamelware Mug (let us know in the comments :)
A  oz-bag of the coffee that our head roaster deems worthy of your generous heart!
This coffee is a collection of smaller lots from producers around the town of Gigante in the Huila Department of Colombia. Grown at elevations ranging from - meters above sea level, these coffees are processed through small washing stations at each farm and then dried on raised beds under parabolic covers.
Sparkling and layered, with flavors of Shirley Temple, dark chocolate, and graham cracker crust.
Every year, with increasing anticipation, we look forward to the arrival of coffees from La Piona. Our relationship with Sebastin Benitez is held in high regard, and we revere him like a patron saint to our coffee program. La Piona was one of the first coffees we ever sourced as a fledgling roaster back in , and through it we were introduced to the myriad specialty producers of Honduras Santa Barbara mountains.
Above the town of El Cielito, overlooking Lake Yojoa, Sebastin grows Pacas cherries at  meters above sea level. Sebastians farm is about as high up the mountain as one can go, and the view of the lake, valley, and villages below is nothing less than stunning. Working the farm with the help of his wife and their  children, Sebastin relies on the help of only a handful of employees during the harvest, and manages to do all of the actual coffee farming himself.
This coffee is sweet and complex - look for regional flavors of grapefruit and peach mingling with Piona's characteristic flavors of sweet orange blossom honey and lemon cake.
Hold your horses, friends! Not everything with a dark horse is as it would first appear; some painted ponies wandering through the desert are sure to be nothing but a mirage.
Inspired by the wild horses that have roamed the inhospitable lands of Californias Death Valley and Ethiopias Kundudo for centuries, our new Autumn Seasonal Espresso combines two of our favorite offerings from the birthplace of coffee, and where it still grows wild. Far from being tamed, these coffees take on wildly new and exciting characteristics when blended.
Alone, our Organic Hama hits like a bouquet of fresh cut flowers. It is light and delicate - almost more of a smell than a flavor. We love it for its racing acidity and short clean finish. On the other hand, the Organic Aramo has been what weve always looked for in the best of coffees from the Yirgacheffe region. It is thick and syrupy sweet. Flavors of berries and melons undulate and evolve in the cup as it cools - a lush and juicy brew every time.
When running astride, these heirloom coffees band together in a big way to gallop all over your tastebuds!
Aromatics of jasmine, lilac, and violet stampede into flavors of sweet berries, blackcurrant, and cantaloupe. Dark chocolate notes keep it all grounded, stable, and surefooted. Both wonderfully heavy and light at the same time, a shot of Dark Horse rushes off as soon as arrived, leaving a clean, bewildering, almost tea-like finish. 
So step right up folks, you wont see this one coming!
All this coffee is here because of one guy: Takele Mammo. 
Hes the director of the Yirgacheffe Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union (YCFCU), and personally introduced our green buyer Steve Ford to both the Hama and Aramo washing stations back in .
The original idea for getting these coffees in the first place was that we wanted to find regional character within Ethiopia. And they managed to do that! Aramo is a classic Yirgacheffe. The basic flavor of Yirgacheffe coffee is blackberries (or sometimes blueberries), heavy, sweet and juicy. Hama is not actually a Yirgacheffe, rather it is an amazing archetype of a Kochere coffee. It is fragrant and floral. The berry is there, but it is much lighter and more delicate, and sometimes tends to be a bit more racy and citrusy. 
It should be known that both of these offerings are from washing stations (not farms or estates) of the same name. At the washing stations, coffee is collected from nearby small producers who pick coffee from the land surrounding where they live its not farming like we really think a lot of this coffee is wild! It grows in native forests, and at crazy altitudes, spanning from  MASL all the way to the screaming heights of  MASL (where coffee really struggles to grow). 
And the varieties are wild as well! Heirloom is what everyone typically calls the Ethiopian plants, but now they are starting to get names like Kurme, Wolisho and Dega. What actually makes up these coffees, we will never truly know, but year after year, Takele and his washing station managers curate amazing offerings that showcase the best of the individual regions. Hama and Aramo are regional coffees at their best.

Colombia Aguacate is back for the third season in a row and continues to establish itself as a mainstay of our menu.
We've been consistently impressed by the high quality coming from this group in Sandon, Nario and we're proud to have it back. The members of Aguacategrow coffee between - meters and peak harvest runs from May to July.
In the cup Aguacate is crisp and sweet with a syrup depththat's rounded out by a green apple acidity and lingering cherry notes. A very versatile coffee that is fantastic on both filter and espresso.
Later this season we'll be featuring a tiny, remarkable day lot from one of the producers of this group!

Our Gachathas have a stronger presence of dried fruit notes; our Riamute and Ibutiti are both a bit more on the wild, fruity side.

This estate operates its own wet mill allowing for local processing of freshly picked coffee cherry. Varieties consist of a majority of SL  with about a third being made up of SL . Once harvested, ripe coffee cherry is depulped and soaked overnight and once fully washed, the coffee is spread out on elevated tables to be slowly sun-dried for approximately three weeks.Afterwards, parchment is delivered to a dry mill for final processing and grading before reaching the weeklyauctions in Nairobi. Our lot of Ibutiti was delivered at the peak of harvest. In the cup we find classic Kenya juiciness. In this case: bright flavors of sweet citrus fruits along with stone fruits followed by a uniquely spiced quality making this coffee a real gem to savor.

Otilio Leiva returns to us for the second year in a row. Through five tables of offering in our sourcing trip last year, Otilio stood out as a top selection. We were later surprised to learn that it was the first year Beneficio San Vicente isolated his harvest to produce a single producer lot based on his improving quality. San Vicente is an exceptional, quality driven mill run by the Paz family. The micro-lot program is handled by Benjamin, who maintains clear communication between producers and roasters, while the quality control operations are maintained by his cousin Arturo. Each member of the Paz family are themselves among the top producers of Honduras who share their experience and knowledge with the many producers in their network. The Los Andes region is incredibly slick and steep; often requiring mules to carry the daily harvests down the single-track trail. In his first year producing a micro-lot Otilio only produced  exportable bags, however this year he was able increase his output to . We are honored to be once again offering Otilio Leivas crop and be a part of his growth as we see his coffee improve.
Otilio Leiva starts off tasting of fresh peach and buttery pie crust, developing into notes of blackberries stewed in white wine. There is a long lingering finish of fresh herbs such as mint, thyme, and sage. This coffee carries the rich stonefruit tones we first fell in love with, but shows the clarity of another year of farm improvements. It is the perfect coffee to sip as you celebrate the relationships in your life this time of year.
Jos Amado Fernndez is a historically exceptional producer. He placed first in the  Honduran Cup of Excellence, and sixth in . Don Amado, the farms namesake and Joss father, passed this farm down to his four sons. Each son inherited his own lot, but share a central facility for washing and processing. The brothers individually oversee their own parcel and process their coffee separately. Jos Amado Fernndezs parcel is . hectares and directly overlooks Lake Yojoa, the largest in Honduras. Our relationship with Jos began with us visiting his farm during the harvest of . He had one of the cleanest and most organized farms we have ever seen. That attention to detail on a farm level carries throughout his production resulting in a beautiful cup. We have been able to commit to purchasing Joss second harvest each year and are proud to bring this back in for the second time. The peach notes and richness carries over from last year, but we are seeing significantly more complexity and improvement in the cup quality overall. Don Amado initially tastes like spiced chocolate and dark nuts, but as it cools the sweetness moves more forward, creating a much more complex cup. The interaction between the spiced nut tones and light carameliness remind us of traditional pecan pie; finishing with a rich stonefruit note similar to peach infused sweet tea. This coffee is dense, complex, and fitting for the season. It is the perfect coffee for these cooler fall mornings.
The Aguilera Brothers manage six farms and their own micro-mill operation entirely within the family, with the exception of a few pickers during the harvest season. The  brothers and sisters inherited the farms from their parents and are now incorporating the third generation into the family business. Each of their farms is planted almost exclusively with Villa Sarchi, a mutation of Bourbon native to the region. This dwarf varietal is known for high production yields and often carries exceptionally floral cupping notes and elegant, tropical fruit acidities. Many Villa Sarchi coffees can be unbalanced in their intensity, but each coffee we have tasted from the Aguilera Brothers has been far more refined than any other from this region. Last year we were able to begin our relationship with the Aguilera Brothers when Tony  our green buyer  visited the farms to meet the family and bought a honey processed lot from Finca Angelina. This year we are honored to serve this washed selection from Finca Chayote, located  meters higher in elevation on their most picturesque property. Finca Chayote starts off pear-like with soft herbal notes that develop into honeyed floral lemon tones very similar to an elderflower cordial. This coffee also has an intriguing mouthfeel that starts off very silky and syrupy but turns effervescent with a sweet, lingering finish. It is the perfect coffee for sipping while sitting on a dock, overlooking a calm lake.
Don Ignacio Gutierrez has been El Salvadors Cup of Excellence Champion in , , and . The family transitioned to coffee production in  after a long history of growing wood trees and tomatoes. Their first two farms, Los Positos and La Roxanita, consisted of just  trees. Their lands sandy loam soil and skilled farming practice lead them to great success in a short amount of time. Each years COE winnings were invested back into their farms, allowing them to continually improve harvests. Winning a single COE is an impressive achievement in its own right; to win three within five years is an exceptional feat. The lot that began the Gutierrez familys legacy was the  harvest of this microlot, Finca La Roxanitas honey processed pacamara. The region of Chalatenango has built a solid reputation for amazing honey processed pacamaras and this farm is one that laid that foundation.
Ignacio Gutierrezs honey pacamara from Finca La Roxanita starts bright and fruity with notes of ripe blackberry and allspice. As it develops on the palate there are complex tones of grilled pineapple, vanilla, and lime with a slight resinous nature that together reminds us of a bright California chardonnay aged on new oak. This coffee is dynamic and complex, but is in no way off-putting. It is the perfect coffee to showcase the mastery Ignacio applies to coffee production, allowing him to be one of the most consistent and outstanding producers in coffee today.
RespectYou go through life meeting a million people, especially in the hospitality industry, and even more so after founding Spyhouse  years ago. You rarely meet someone that you immediately can connect with, both on a personal level, but also on a professional one. When you do meet that person, it is a connection that will hopefully be lifelong. I felt this during Laila's visit to Spyhouse.
Meet Laila Ghambari, @lay_luh, Director of Coffee at Cherry Street Coffee in Seattle, who spent the last week in May with us. Her confident stature, bar prowess, and an operational understanding of precision and clarity were what inspired me to reach out to her. She is not only one to look up to in the coffee industry, but one to look up to in any industry. She is not only one to look up to as one of the leading women in coffee, but one of the leading persons in coffee. Laila is a testament to a strong work ethic while performing professionally with devotion, passion, and unwavering attention to detail. Thank you, Laila, for all your inspiration and insight. See you soon! - Christian, Founder/Owner Spyhouse Coffee Roasters
Ive been with Spyhouse for just over two years. I started as a barista at the Hennepin location, and got to watch with envy as Tony crafted a spectacular in-house roasting program for a company that was previously a multi-roaster shop. My love for coffee and restless desire for knowledge craved nothing more than to work directly with Tony, and learn and apprentice under him.
In January of , that wish was granted when I was made a roasting and packaging assistant. Five short months later, I was full time in the roasting department acting as a production roaster and packaging manager. I was honored to have been lifted to that position in such a short time.
I never thought that within that brief period Id be given an opportunity to travel to origin. For that, Im incredibly grateful.
This trip, hosted by Caf Imports, brought Christian (owner) and I to the city of Xalapa in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. We and several others from roasting companies across the US were to judge a national coffee competition that Caf Imports has been organizing over the last few years to help bring prestige to the hard working coffee producers in Mexico who are often overlooked by the specialty coffee industry. Its called Lo Mejor De Mexico  literally, The Best of Mexico.
Lo Mejor De Mexico has special significance to us at Spyhouse. Last year, two of our employees Kathie, our educator; and Kimberly, a barista competed in the Big Central regional Barista Championship with a coffee from Ixhautln, Mexico, that won rd place in last years Lo Mejor competition. Those who are regulars might remember it for its killer espresso profile and elegantly balanced brew character. It was truly a coffee that could bring a smile to anyone, and we like to think it helped changed some preconceived notions of Mexican coffee.
This years competition took place over two days in the Beneficio Las Animas wet mill. Entries from all over Mexico were submitted, and Caf Imports team narrowed around  submissions down to half that for the scored and judged rounds. The first day consisted of  rounds of cupping, each judge filling out score sheets based around dry fragrance, wet aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, sweetness, and an overall cuppers score.
Between each around, every cupper shared his or her scores and thoughts for each coffee. Soon, a top  emerged.
The next day, the  advancing coffees were re-roasted and re-cupped. There was a palpable tension in the air amongst the echoing slurps as each cupper focused intently on grading and evaluating every coffee they tasted. After all, we were deciding the best coffee in Mexico a heavy decision.
Results were tabulated, information was disbursed, and an award ceremony was held later that night. This year brought about a first for the Lo Mejor competition: a live auction of the top  winning coffees. Producers who placed in the top  were invited to the ceremony to receive congratulations and awards from AMSA, another organizer of Lo Mejor and a company dedicated to enriching and enhancing coffee farming in Mexico.
Intense bidding ensued, and the farmers who produced such spectacular coffees were rewarded with a price per pound well above average market value (as well as the aforementioned prizes from AMSA). When the dust finally settled, each and every representative of the present US roasteries had a huge grin on their face and an appetite that could only be satiated by tacos and tequila both of which were aplenty after the auction.
We at Spyhouse won  bags total in the auction, each bag being kg/~lbs:  of the  total bags of the st Place coffee, GRAPOS El Porvenir; and the entire  bag lot of El Amate, the th Place coffee (though both Christian and I scored El Amate as our rd favorite coffee overall).
Between rounds of cupping, we spent much of our time traveling to other significant coffee-related sites around the area. The Dos Rios dry mill we visited is responsible for the sorting and final preparation of coffee received from various wet mills around the region. Additionally, Dos Rios has a large coffee nursery where scientists are working on creating genetic hybrids of Robusta plants and specialty-grade Arabica plants in an effort to fight the roya (rust) leaf disease that has been devastating many Central and South American coffee farms. Robusta plants are incredibly disease resistant and high producing, and this hybridization process (known as embryogenesis) is able to create a coffee plant with the exceptional heartiness Robusta is known for while retaining the complex and delicious cup character of Arabica.
We also visited the farms of two producers who entered the Lo Mejor competition. Finca Consopalan and Finca Fatima are both a short drive from Xalapa in the region of Coatepec. Though Mexicos harvest season is over, there were still many flowering and fruited plants on the farms. The beauty of both farms was immeasurable, and the care and dedication of their respective producers both of whom we met was instantly noticeable.
Our first and foremost mission at Spyhouse is to responsibly source amazing coffees and build direct relationships with excellent producers. Our commitment to this shows in the coffees we buy out of major growing regions like Costa Rica, Colombia, Guatemala, Ethiopia, etc. Additionally, we strongly believe in developing and encouraging excellent coffee in passed-over regions like Peru, Ecuador, and Mexico. Since the inception of our roasting program, weve made it a point to work closely with producers in these areas to help maximize their potential and bring you, the customer, the best coffee possible.
We hope you enjoy drinking these coffees as much as we enjoyed sourcing and buying them for you. Look for them in our offerings list in the next few months.

Since the inception of Spyhouse in , our primary goals have been to ensure quality, sustainability, education, and a commitment to producing the finest coffee and espresso drinks. Over the years, we've had the pleasure of exploring quality coffee through the many roasters featured at Spyhouse. This attention, hard work, and dedication to the craft, inspired us to join in the pursuit by beginning our own roasting endeavor in Fall of .
Founded by Christian Johnson, Owner/Director of Operations, Spyhouse began as a small, independent coffeehouse emphasizing mid-century design, exhibiting local artists, and encouraging social interaction. Over the years, attention to the quality of the craft of coffee took on a more dominant role, thus transforming Spyhouse to what it is today. The defining components to us are our passion for sourcing, roasting, brewing, and serving the customer an exceptional coffee, and educating that customer on the entire processfrom origin to consumption.
A complementary passion to coffee is interior design. The elements of design play a vital role in promoting specialty coffee with allowing the customer to enjoy their coffee moments in an environment that is conducive to the coffee experience. Collecting antiques has always been a passionate pastime of the owner. The character and history of each piece acquired for the cafes has helped define each location with its own identity and charm.
The human component in defining Spyhouse is the staff. We are proud to have built a team of professionals that strive everyday to ensure that the operations of each cafe, the roasting department, and barista trainers/managers function to their best ability to bring you, the customer, an experience we can be proud of, and that you enjoy.

The design questionnaire you received is a way for our team to get information about your business and goals for your store design. The more information you are able to provide in the questionnaire, the better able our team is to understand the design direction and goals of your online store. If youre unsure of how to answer a question, check out the FAQs below, and if you do not see your question answered there, go ahead and skip it. Once youve filled out as much of the questionnaire as you can, please send it back to your Project Coordinator for review. They will then schedule a design consultation with you and the designer to go over your questionnaire responses, and dive into more design details for the store design.
If youre looking to simply update your current design, it is best that you list out the items you want to change from your current design in the questionnaire. Listing the specific items that need updating will help the designer prepare their suggestions for the updated design. If you happen to like certain elements from other websites that you would like to mimic in your updated design, it is beneficial to list those sites and the specific parts of the site you like to give the designer a visual of what you would like to see for the updates.
Google Analytics is a great way to get insights on the traffic that is coming to your site so you can continue to improve your business. You can set up an account here, and then send the coding to your Project Coordinator so it can be implemented into the coding for your new design.
The keywords will help your designer understand the types of words your visitors search for when landing on your website. Listing - keywords will be a good amount of keywords for the designer to get a grasp of the types of words visitors will be looking for when they reach your online store.
We ask for the category names to get a sense of how many main categories youre planning on having for your site. If youre not sure about the names, that is quite okay. A ballpark number of how many main categories youre considering having for the main navigation will suffice. This will help the designer plan out a proper amount of space for the categories in your navigation as well as determine what style of navigation will be best for your site. The designer will be able to show you what the category names will look like in the design, but it will be up to you to set up those categories in your admin area for the site. The categories that you set up in your admin area are what will actually display in the design when it is installed, and our Support Team is available / should you need any assistance with the steps to set up categories for your site.
Yes, the designer will have reviewed your questionnaire responses before the design consultations, and will talk through the design of the home page with you during the call. They will be able to offer up suggestions as to what to promote on your home page to make the design both functional and informative for your customers.
First off, congratulations! You have purchased your store, you're organizing its content, and now it's time to decide on a navigation menu style that's right for you and your new design. It can feel like a big endeavor if you're just getting started, and sometimes an even bigger endeavor if you're reorganizing existing content. This article will walk you through the pros and cons of each menu style, and offer some tips for choosing the menu that is right for your business.Before diving into the menu style options, there are a few questions you'll want to ask yourself about your store's organization:Have you made a list of your main categories and subcategories you would like to display in your store? This is a great way to get started and really helps you assess each of the navigation types, as each features its own benefits and disadvantages.Will you have multiple levels of subcategories in your navigation menu? For example: Electronics > Apple > iPod > iPod Mini. You want to consider how many levels of subcategories you will need as certain navigation styles only expand to one or two levels of subcategories. Remember, the simpler  the better!Do you like a top navigation, or left navigation? A top navigation has a fixed width, so typically an average of - category names fit nicely in the space. If you have more main categories than this, a left navigation will allow you to display all of the information the customer needs to see. Additionally, a combination of top and left navigations can be used for sites with a large amount of categories.
Now that you've made a list of the categories you need, let's talk about each option.
Your Volusion store comes with a large selection of templates that allow you to quickly and easily set up a distinctive and customizable storefront.

Hard to believe it's that time of year again! Though the weather hasn't given us a cold shoulder yet, the leaves are exploding with radiance, as is my family about the season's festivities. Commence with the texting! Though I'm not a big fan of holiday creep (Christmas in July, anyone?), past years of procrastination have left me scrambling. This year, I promised myself that I'll be different, starting with making sure I have the perfect coffee for Thanksgiving (Don't forget the Decaf either! Seriously, our Decaf Colombia is really good!). Thankfully, we're releasing our Holiday Blend  this week, so you and I can check great coffee off our lists nice and early (Did you know most of our coffees taste better with almost a week of rest off-roast?). There will be fresh roasts every week through Christmas, so stop back often to recharge, as we're pretty sure your company will love this full, sweet, satisfying coffee!
To build this two-bean blend, we started with the idea that a holiday coffee should be well-liked by everyone in your house. We also wanted it to pair well with traditional holiday food, drink, and dessert. To do this, we began with our Ethiopia Wazzala Natural - a coffee with a big personality that brings a barrelfull of dark red fruit to the cup. Imagine ripe cranberries followed by a sip of red wine. Of course, every leading character needs a foil to bring out the best in both, so we experimented with blending several different coffees before striking gold with the Honduras Jaguar Land III. Though it sounds more like the latest B-movie blockbuster than delicious coffee, trust us when we say this washed Central just works as a contrast to its fruitier Natural counterpart. Adding a deep, molasses-like sweetness and warming spice aromatics, the Jaguar Land's deeply steady Spock plays the perfect sidekick to the Wazzala's flamboyant Kirk, creating a fuller, more complex, more satisfying cup. 
We wish you and your family a wonderful holiday season!
If you pressed me, I'd probably tell you that I prefer Washed coffees over Natural coffees ninety-nine times out of a hundred. I'm not trying to be a Natural hater. It's just that I enjoy Washed coffees' cleaner flavor (as a result of fewer defects and little-to-no fermentation), sparkling acidity, and engaging mouthfeel more. Every once in a while though, a Natural coffee comes along that tastes clean, berrylicious, but not too fermenty, and just incredibly delightful. Our Ethiopia Wazzala Natural is such a coffee, tasting of strawberry, cherry, and raisins, which is why I'm super excited about this year's version of Asymmetries!
You all know the deal - Asymmetries is a progressive espresso series predicated around two coffees, one washed and one natural. This year, it's the Ethiopia Wazzala Natural as mentioned, and the Ethiopia Beriti Washed. We'll start with a blend of % Wazzala Natural and % Beriti Washed, then subsequently shift the blend % towards the Natural every few weeks.
Why should you try it? Because Ethiopian coffees are some of the best in the world! Also, most cafes serve static blends, which are comforting and consistent, but a progressive blend gives you insight into how blending ratios affect flavor, body, and more. Look for your favorite cafe to carry the entire series so you get to taste the experience! You can also order the series online. Don't have an espresso machine? That's okay! I highly recommend our Asymmetries blends in an immersion dripper, press pot, or other steeping methods.
What to know more about the coffees? Check them out here:
Beriti Washed      -  http://store.ceremonycoffee.com/coffees/beriti.html
                              Character - Crisp, juicy, medium body, silky, citrus
Wazzala Natural  -  http://store.ceremonycoffee.com/coffees/wazzala_natural.html
                              Character - Sweet, creamy, full body, berries & cherries
V, a % to % blend, leads heavy on the Bertiti Washed. Buy a bag here: http://store.ceremonycoffee.com/coffees/asymmetries_v.html 
To get your mouth watering, here's what you can expect to taste in V:
Fresh melon aromatics
Sweet chocolate and blackberry
in a crisp, juicy cup
You can see the Beriti asserting itself in V with the overall experience being on the crisp, juicy side. A hint of the Wazzala Natural sneaks in with the blackberry though! We think this version will make a beautiful espresso, Long Black, or Cortado. As the blend progresses toward the Natural, the body will get fuller, the taste fruitier, and the mouthfeel more mellow. This shift will take any milk drink and imbue it with the taste of berries and cream. I can't wait!
How did we extract V? I'm glad you asked! First thing, age that roast to at least one week off. I promise it'll taste so much more flavorful once the degassing begins to subside! If you are pulling shots in its second week off-roast, try a :. "Golden" brew ratio* in - seconds (no pre-infusion was used on our end) at a F set point. As the roast ages to week three, try tightening up your brew ratio to closer to :. and pulling for - seconds.

With the doors at our Baltimore cafe now open, it feels like a good time to take a breath and reflect on the process. Our team at Ceremony has spent thousands of hours over the past year planning the space, training new baristas, and testing culinary concepts, all to bring Charm City denizens the cafe they deserve!
A key cog in opening  Park has been one of Ceremony's newest hires, the manager of our Baltimore caf - Jared Cate. Let's get to know this fellow a little better.
MH Hi, Jared. It has been pretty cool to see the hard work you've put into the cafe. Were you just born this amazing? What's your story?
JC Being a military kid, I have lived in many places. If you go by where I was born: Stuttgart Germany. If you go by where my parents are from: Tampa, Florida. If you go by most recent home: Boulder, Colorado. If you go by longest time in a location: York, England. (Is that a long enough answer?)
MH Wow. You're quite the globe trekker. How did you get started with coffee?
JC In college, I started drinking espresso drinks at a local coffee shop, and quickly came to the realization that I couldnt afford them, so I got a job there for the employee discount.
MH That sounds strangely familiar! So you, like me, got in for the perks. What has kept you in the game?
JC There are two things that have kept me in coffee for this long: The opportunity to continue learning about amazing coffee by being around it all the time, and being able to be a part of a community - making a simple but significant difference in customers' days.
MH What a guy. We're on the same page again. Customer experience is number one. Going back to your first point though - what is your current favorite coffee and favorite coffee of all time?
JC I currently keep reaching for the Ethiopia Wazzala. The depth of flavor and complexity keeps it exciting every time. My favorite of all time is the first time I tried a naturally processed Ethiopian Harrar. While it may not be my current favorite, it's definitely one of the most memorable coffee experiences I have ever had.
MH I think many people, both in and out of coffee, would echo your sentiments about that naturally processed Ethiopian eureka moment. I experienced the same deal with a batch brew of Wondo in NYC! Ok, few more questions. What is your favorite coffee ritual? 
JC I dont know if I have a favorite ritual. One of the things I love about the coffee world is that it is so diverse. You can have coffee in different ways all the time and not ever get stuck in a rut.
MH Great point! It really takes effort to make coffee brewing boring with how the seeds and the ideal parameters are constantly changing. Thanks for taking the time answer these questions, so we can get to know you a little better. What is something people might not know about you from meeting you in the cafe?
JC I have  kids! So far, they all like coffee, and my oldest boy is starting to learn to pull shots on our home espresso machine!
MH So if we run into staffing problems, we don't have far to look for new applicants! As a family-man and resident of Baltimore, what do you plan on bringing to your community's newest caf?
JC I want to bring an eye opening coffee experience to the Mount Vernon neighborhood, and Baltimore in general; not only though the quality of the coffee, but through the quality of service as well. The coffee world can sometimes seem unapproachable to the uninitiated, so our goal is to portray specialty coffee in a way that isnt off-putting, and gets people at every level of coffee knowledge excited.
MH I couldn't agree more. Specialty coffee doesn't have to be scary or intimidating. Rather, as our bag says, "Coffee should be something special" and the right group of baristas can make that happen for the folks of Baltimore! We hope you, dear reader, can find a moment to check out our new spot at  Park, and please feel free to say hello to Jared! Until next time, happy brewing!
If you ever tasted our house-made cold brew, you know how refreshing and drinkable it is. So why mess with a good thing? Well, after much experimentation, we've feel like we've done one better with a little help from our friends. Over the last month, we've been working with Oliver Brewing Company, Baltimore's oldest running pub and brewery, to roll out the first couple batches of our kegged Nitro Cold Brew. The feedback has been exciting - if you take your meals in the Naval Academy Dining Hall, you know what I'm talking about!
So what is Nitro Cold Brew? We start with one of our freshly-ground single-origins, add filtered, room temp water, and allot about a day's worth of time. With these fundamental items, we increase the recipe from a -gallon Toddy to a several-hundred gallon lauter tun at Oliver. Surprisingly, it's not as hard as you might think to scale up a brew - if you account for dose, water, temperature, turbulence, grind size, off-grind time, roast consistency, roast age, and a few dozen other variables! Okay, so it is a little tricky, but we quickly figured it out under the steady hand of Oliver's owner, Justin Dvorkin. From the a lauter tun, aka big metal tub #, we filter the fresh brew, then nitrogenate and keg the freshly gassy coffee. Nitrogen has a very different effect on coffee compared to carbon dioxide. Instead of being effervescent, prickly, and slightly sour from carbonation, the nitrogen creates a creamy, velvety, slightly sweet effect. The gas you most likely know from Guinness and % of the Earth's atmosphere also serves to reduce oxidation, which in turn keeps the coffee tasting fresh and flavorful for longer. We've had kegs taste good over a month, which is considerably longer than regular cold brew left in a jar or pitcher. The best thing is, when you order a nitro cold brew, all our barista must do is fully pull on a stout tap to fill up your glass!
As you see, you'd be forgiven for thinking that this % coffee-based beverage is a beer, but watching the cascading bubbles is only part of the enjoyment. If you love sweet, but not-too-sweet, creamy, way-too-easy-to-drink coffee beverages, then our nitro cold brew is definitely for you. Come enjoy a glass today at Ceremony and at many of our wholesale partners coming soon!
Fictional cafetero Juan Valdez and his trusty donkey Conchita are the touchstones of Colombian coffee for most Americans. As they iconically ambled through my first caffeinated memories, I remember being struck by the humanity and effort signified by the characters. Millions now share in this association as the result of an incredibly effective marketing campaign launched by Colombia's National Federation of Coffee Growers in the late-'s. Meant to differentiate the country's primary agricultural export, the characters worked so well that Colombia now sells the second-most Coffea arabica in the world, behind only Brazil. Indeed, if you've ever tasted coffee, chances are good it was from Colombia.
Though initially introduced by an advertising icon, Colombia is a coffee-growing origin we at Ceremony have come to know and love. The small size of most Colombian farms allows for highly-detailed work, like ripe picking of berries and controlled washed processing and drying. This extra attention translates to increased sweetness and higher cup quality all around. Most Colombian smallholding-producers own less than five hectares of land, so they don't have to sacrifice quality by attempting to manufacture large quantities. With a manageable farm, each producer or co-op has great control over their trees, harvest, and processing, resulting in focused, articulate coffees. It doesn't hurt that most producers grow the Caturra cultivar - a sweet, sometimes bright cultivar of the Coffea arabica Bourbon line. In response to coffee leaf rust destroying crops, we're seeing many, if not most Colombian farms now growing a small section of the Colombia and/or Castillo cultivars. Gaitana, Cedro, and Vergel are no exception. These two arabica/canephora hybrids were developed by Colombia's CENICAFE to have a pleasing taste and to be disease resistant - important with rising temperatures and shifting climate patterns making coffeelands more susceptible to disease. We're still missing a critical piece though - without which specialty coffee wouldn't grow at all. Great land.
Colombia cradles some of the most coffee-arable land in the world. With plenty of sun and rain, nourishing soil, high altitudes, and moderate temperatures, Colombia has all the requisite climatic aspects to grow delicious specialty coffees. Since this South American country straddles the Equator, growing regions are tropical and allow for two harvests a year (as opposed to most coffeelands harvesting only once). The main harvest here is called "Principal", while a second, smaller harvest is called 'Mitaca'. Equatorial latitudes ensure that temperatures, even at higher elevations, stay comfortable, warm (~F), and supportive of maturing coffee berries. Bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, Colombia receives an average of ,mm of rainfall per year, which is critical for vegetative growth. The Andes Range bisects the country north-to-south with mountains and several active volcanoes. Over millennia, eruptions deposited mineral-rich ash about the topsoil, providing las cafeteras and their coffee plants a highly-organic, nourishing bed. Gaitana, Cedro, and Vergel all lie in the same lush area of south-central Colombia - and thus, each of these three farms/co-ops have the ideal general climatic conditions for producing specialty coffee.
The distinction between these coffees mostly comes down to microclimate, which can be defined as "a local atmospheric zone where the climate differs from the surrounding area". At its core, Specialty coffee is based, at least in part, on this concept of microclimate. The core idea being that "special geographic microclimates produce beans with unique flavor profiles". Erna Knutsen used these words to define and coin the term "specialty coffees" back in ! With that in mind, take a look at the details of each coffee, think about the flavors and body you're getting, then imagine how a given terroir might be affecting your shot. What is the aroma/flavor/density like? How does this change our approach to brewing? Does a higher altitude or lower latitude mean anything in particular in this case? Does the freshness of the harvest matter?

Yirgacheffe is known for its clean, floral and acidity driven washed coffees. The area where this coffee is grown, Gedeo, has, in our experience, some of the most complex and intense coffees in the Yirgacheffe region. 
Around  individual family-owned farmers deliver their cherries grown in Gedeo to the privately owned washing station Aricha in the local community of Aricha, located in the highlands close to Yirgacheffe town. On each of these farms local heirloom varieties are cultivated and in some cases even new varieties have been planted in order to diversify and rejuvenate biodiversity. Organic fertilizer is common used on the farms but pesticides are actively avoided, farmers instead focusing on good farming practices to help encourage large and healthy plants. Futher, on Aricha they are working to increase quality through a more systematic work at the processing station. The coffee from this producer is limited in amounts and only a selection of the highest qualities are now sold through Nordic Approach to us.
Varietal: Ethiopian Heirloom. Improved varietals and native coffee of forest origin transferred to family smallholder plots and gardens. In this case they refer to it as Yirgacheffe type.
Producers: About  smallholders in the surrounding areas as well as remote farmers. Varietals: Grade: Screen  and up.
Production: Pulped and wet fermented, graded in washing channels, soaked in water and sundried. Process: Cherries are hand sorted for unripes and overripes by the farmers before they go in to production. A  disc Aagaarde pulper removes the skin and pulp. The coffees are then fermented under water for - hours, dependent on the weather conditions. Its then graded in washing channels in to two grades based on density. It is then soaked under clean water in tanks for - hours. Drying: Sun dried    days days on African drying beds on hessian cloths. Coffees are covered in plastic during midday and at night. 
Notes: This is a very special coffee from a private mill in the local community of Aricha, not far from Yirgacheffe town. Among the familyfarms around Aricha we find both recently plated trees of improved varietals as well as old traditional varietals. This coffee is a part of avery small share of the total production, selected on quality.
Cupping notes: Juicy with notes of wild strawberries, sweetieand jasmin.

In the Nyeri region in Central Kenya  smallholders are delivering cof- fee from the surrounding areas of the Chorongi factory. The coffee is being graded into AA, AB and PB which refers to the bean size, where AA, as this coffee, is the larger beans. Having this in mind the coffees are grown at a fairly low altitude,  meters, which gi- ves a slightly more mature character. The beans are being pulped and wet fermented for - hours under closed shade, graded in washing chan- nels, soaked under clean water for  to  hours and dried on raised beds for up to  days.

In Rwanda % of coffee produced is fully washed and exported, the remaining % is processed directly on the farm and sold locally. In the Kigoma region in southern Rwanda, our Norwegian raw coffee sourcer Nordic Approach work with about  farmers towards the goal of producing the best coffee in the country. Together they are working for a more sustainable and profitable coffee production.

I r vidgar vi bilden av vad Kenyanskt kaffe kan vara. Tidigare har vi huvudsakligen tagit in kaffe frn Nyeriregionen i Kenya som r knda fr sin klara, syrliga karaktr. Nu har vi valt att fokusera mer p regionen Kirinyaga. p samma latitud som Nyeri, men de vstra sluttningarna vid Mount Kenya. Kaffet i den hr regionen har en mer mogen och st karaktr.
Hr handlar vi frn processtationen Mugaya Factory, knd fr sin hg kvalitet i processen, deras gynnsamma jord och deras utmrkta hjdlge. Lokala bnder, vissa med ranger innehllande  trd, andra med strre omrden, levererar kaffebnor till den processtationen, dr de graderas och processas.
P tvttstationen Mugaya pulpas kaffet och graderas utifrn sin densitet i tre olika grader; detta r den AA som innebr att det r den strsta storleken i selektionen av bnorna. Beroende p gradering torkar bnorna i solen mellan  och  timmar. Bnorna graderas sedan terigen utifrn densiteten i tvttkanalerna, fr att sedan bltlggas i rent vatten i - timmar. Kaffet fr sedan soltorka i - dagar, beroende p vderleken p de upphjda afrikanska torkbddarna innan de r klara fr leverans till oss fr rostning.
Kooperativet Mutira, som Mugaya tillhr, har investerat mycket resurser i att utbilda bnderna i omrdet i hllbar produktion, detta fr att hjlpa till att ka bde kvaliteten och avkastningen av kaffeplantorna.
Process: Fermenterat i  timmar innan det handsorteras fr att ta bort defekter och pulpas. Drefter bltlggs kaffet i omkring  timmar.
Smakbeskrivning: Saftig med intensiva svartvinbrstoner. Vldigt st och vlstrukturerad. Lng eftersmak av rosa grapefrukt. 
This year were opening up the picture of what a Kenyan coffee can be. For many years we were mainly buying coffee from the Nyeri region, infamous for its acidic driven profile. This year were focusing more on Kirinyaga in the central region and Eldoret in the Western part of Kenya. The wet mill, Mugaya Factory, lies in Kirinyaga, a neighbouring area to Nyeri on the western slopes of Mount Kenya. The factory is well known for its high quality processing as well as for having great soil and altitude. Local smallholders, with lots ranging from around  trees and upwards, deliver coffee cherries to the wet mill, where they are graded and processed.
Once at the Mugaya factory, the skin and pulp of the cherries are removed in a mechanical pulper. They are then graded by density into three grades by the pulper fermented separately depending on the grade for - hours under shade. After fermentation the coffees are washed and once again graded by density in the washing channels, after which the coffee is soaked in clean water for - hours. The coffee is then sun dried between  to  days depending on the weather condition on African drying beds.
The cooperative is deeply invested in educational programs with farmers to help train and promote sustainable farming practices in the area, in order to help increase both quality and yield of the coffee plants.
Farm:  smallholders in the areas surrounding the wet mill
Process: Fermented  hours after being hand sorted for defects and de-pulped mechanically, the coffee is then washed and soaked in clean water for - hours
Soil: Nitisol, a red volcanic soil rich in minerals.
Cupping notes: Juicy cup with intense notes of blackcurrant and gooseberries, very sweet and well-structured, with a juicy mouthfeel and long, lingering aftertaste

There are thousands of coffee roasteries around the world. There is probably one not far from you. But there are not many Drop Coffee. We have decided to work with coffee in certain ways - because we enjoy it like this. We think you will to. If you have any questions - please send us a mail or see if youll find the answer below.
Why so expensive shipping for international orders?- We wonder as well and only charge exactly what it costs us. But we are working on it. If you know a cheaper and smarter alternative to Posten - let us know! And gather some friends and order togeather - free shipping if you get - boxes. Or even better - push your local dealer to become a partner making sure you always have fresh beans in your favorite coffee shop.
Why do you not have Klarna as an option for payment?-Good question. We will send that through to Klarna and Shopify and maybe they will go from "very soon" to action in this matter. Until then we can only say that it will work very soon and that no customer so far have had any complaints on our service via Paypal.
Do you have any espresso blend?-We enjoy a good blend once in a while. But at Drop Coffee we buy extremely good green beans where the producers have pushed the limits of what a coffee can taste like from that farm, region and country. What a waste to blend it with other spectaculare coffees. We always try to roast coffee thats good in its own. In the same time we get even coffees that will extract evenly every time.
How should I brew Drop Coffee?-No matter what brew method you choose you need to make sure you get all the flavours out. Our coffee has reasonably high acidity - but also a very high sweetness. But its easier to extract acidity and bitterness than sweetness. If you use a decent grinder, good hot water and clean equipment you should be fine. Have a look at our recepies for Kalita here. For espresso we always start by  part grounded coffeeto  parts espresso (weighing with a gram scale) in - seconds.
Can I come and work with you? -We hope so. Send us a mail and tell us your story.
Can I come and roast with you? -Of course. Send a mail to Joanna and book a two day professional roasting program where we share all our secrets. Lesson one - there are no secrets.
What dates are you giving courses?-During fall and spring we give at least one course of every kind per month. The dates will be publishedunder each of the different courses as we go, depending on demand. When you see a date you want to attend - send a mail to boka@dropcoffee.se.
Can I get your price list for wholesale? -Yupp - info@dropcoffee.se is the way to proceed.

Our coffee bar at Wollmar Yxkullsgatan  (metro station Mariatorget, exit Mariatorget,  meters to the right of the exit) in Sdermalm is the heart of Drop Coffee. This is where we started up as a brick in the wall , and started rosting on our , kg roaster. Today we roast all our coffee using a turquoise Dierich  kg roaster, in Vstberga, and we do this to the highest level we know today. At the coffee bar the coffee is brewed to perfection by some of the most skilled baristas i Sweden, by hand as espresso or filter. All our focus is on serving an even better cup of coffee  every day. Today the coffee shop has tripled the number of seats compered to when we first opened, and we became coffee shop of the year  according to White Guide.
Beside our coffee you can get breakfast or lunch, we serve toasted sandwiches and soups after season, and home made fika. 
All our coffee is available for resale fresh from our rostery, as whole beans or freshlyground for the desired brewing method.We also sell the brewing equipment we recommend for home brewing, and have the national agency on Kalita.

In  we met up with our partner producers from Brazil at the Nordic Roasters Forum in Stockholm, Sweden.
Joao Hamilton, from Stio Cana and Felipe Croce from Fazenda Ambiental Fortaleza were invited to talk about how they approach working directly with roasters.

In January , we made a trip to Pittsfield, Massachusetts to visit the home of Chemex coffee makers.

Better late than never... We would like to share some video from our 
trip to Beneficio Don Mayo in Costa Rica. We sampled quite a few coffees
 last year from Costa Rica and Beneficio Don Mayo, particularly their 
Bella Vista farm cupped near the top.

For the past two years we've traveled to Kenya specifically to source this coffee from the Kamwangi Factory, whose coffees have consistently cupped up as the best we've tasted from Kenya. In  we are hoping to start a quality initiative directly with the New Ngariama Society, through which we hope to improve their drying tables.
This year a similar lot of Kamwangi placed rd in the World Brewers Championship, which is unusual, given that the winning coffees are generally naturally processed. A testament to the incredible cup quality of this coffee.

The AeroPress is a coffee making system ideal for travel, or brewing a small amount at the home or office. It makes a very clean, sediment-free cup in a short period of time, and it is easy to clean up. You just need ground coffee, hot water, and a mug (ideally you brew directly into a mug, not included in the kit).
Brewing with the AeroPress gives good control over the variables - you can easily adjust the water temperature or water-to-coffee ratio to change the results. In my tests, the cup results match both the full pot Technivorm brews and my cupping results (the process where we mix grinds directly with water and use a spoon to taste many coffees at once.)
Here is an instructional video with more info on brewing with this!
A lot of our coffees are prepared quite nicely with this method. It does add a bit more body to the coffee than a v does.

We are happy to be working with Scott Rao to sell his books officially in Europe! It holds it own as the most concise, andthoroughbook on barista training available.
FROM THE AUTHOR: When I began in the coffee business fourteen years ago, I read every book I could find about coffee. After reading all of those books, however, I felt as if I hadn't learned much about how to make great coffee. My coffee library was chock-full of colorful descriptions of brewing styles, growing regions, and recipes, with a few almost-unreadable scientific books mixed in. I would have traded in all of those books for one serious, practical book with relevant information about making great coffee in a caf. Fourteen years later, I still haven't found that book. I know many other professionals as well as some obsessive nonprofessionals would like to find that same book I've been looking for. This book is my attempt to give it to them.

Five Elephant is a specialty coffee micro roastery, bakery and cafe in Berlin, Germany. Passionate about quality, our goal is to source the best coffees in the world in a way that is both socially and environmentally responsible.
We strive to involve our customers in a conversation about coffee and are committed to sourcing the green beans that we roast in the most direct way possible.

We dont just visit our partners at origin, but work to understand their processes, from cultivation to preparation. We are committed to innovation and will never stop working to improve the coffee that we source and roast, including our relationship with the farmers who grow the coffee.

Put your aeropress and cup on a scale. Bring filtered water to a boil. Thoroughly rinse paper filter to get rid of paper flavor.
Weigh out  grams of whole bean coffee. Grind the coffee a bit finer than filter drip (or use a grind that suits best for flavor and extraction).
Pull water off of the boil, and wait  seconds to a minute, or until the water is - degrees Fahrenheit. Start your timer, and quickly pour the water into the aeropress until it reaches  grams of water (near the top). Stir coffee.
Place plunger in just enough to seal the top, and keep coffee from dripping through.
 At  seconds, remove the plunger, and stir for five seconds. Place the plunger back on the aeropress to keep coffee from dripping through.
At  minute  seconds, remove plunger and stir for  seconds. Place the plunger and slowly push down for  seconds, until you hear a hissing sound. There should be moderate resistance. If it's very difficult to push down, your grind is too fine, if it's very easy, your grind is too coarse.
Make sure your coffee maker is clean and free of residue build up. Weigh out your coffee. A good ratio to start would be  grams (. ounces) of coffee to  liter (. ounces) of water.

In the small cup medium in body but smooth in mouthfeel, crisply pungent yet caramelly sweet, with a tightly knit, understated complexity: brandy, caramel, cedar and flowers, hints of which persist in the roundly rich finish.

Our  point espresso returns along with it's sweet blast of caramel, brown sugar and molasses flavors. Followed by a creamy dark chocolate and orange finish, The Las Ranas will definitely get your day going! 

	Owned and operated by JASAL, the home of renowned producers Jose Antonio Salaverria, Cerro Las Ranas takes its name from a lagoon that is populated by thousands of frogs (Hill of the Frogs). 
	

	Cerro is the pride and joy of Don Jose Antonio and since the devastating Santa Ana Volcano eruption in October, , he has restored the farm to pristine shape. Ripe, red cherry is picked and delivered to Las Cruces Mill where it undergoes a process pioneered by JASAL that is now becoming more and more common throughout Central America. The cherry is processed normally but the coffee is then immediately sent to the clay drying patios still covered in the sticky mucilage where it is laid out and constantly raked and turned to ensure even drying. 
	

	This process (called Pulped Natural or Miel,honey-processed) imparts a subtle sweetness and fruit note, lending an atypical complexity to the cup.
	

 Points by Coffee Review

Blind Assessment:

	Complexly structured: quite sweet with a tart and bitterish balance. Honey, tangerine, dark chocolate, hints of flowers and apricot in aroma and small cup. Full, buttery mouthfeel.

Our new Helsar Cascara (coffee cherry) tea from Costa Rica offers a sweet fusion of raspberry, raisins, orange along with honey and subtle green tea undertones. 
	

	This Cascara is from Finca Santa Lucia located in the Naranjo region (West Valley), Costa Rica. Ricardo Perez is one of the owners of Helsar de Zarcero - which is also a coffee we sell online (click HERE to see). For the past three years, Ricardo has been working with the University of Costa Rica to develop a new way to do cascara, and we're excited to offer this product to all our Klatchaholics! 
	

	Typically, Cascara is produced by washing the pulp and drying on raised beds in the sun, similar to specialty coffees we offer. Ricardo has built an entire facility dedicated to producing cascara. The process is enclosed to create the most sanitary conditions. After the coffee is depulped, the cherry skins are washed with clean water and then go through a vaporizing chamber that heats them very fast and very hot to kill any potential bacteria. After this cleaning process, the skins are put into a large dehydrator to remove all the moisture.

	There are several local conditions that set this coffee apart from others. The farm is located at a very high elevation, one of the two highest coffee farms in Panama. It is grown in rich, volcanic soil with a cool climate and a significant amount of fog and mist during the dry season. The coffee trees are surrounded by virgin-native cloudy rain forest, and because of the cool temperatures at night, it takes  to  years longer than the average coffee tree before these trees begin to produce. The low temperatures also contribute to an extended ripening time by  month, creating a more developed coffee bean.

	A Hawaiian coffee bean from the Big Island that delivers. The sweetest Hawaiian coffee with notes of honey and chocolate on the nose with molasses, milk chocolate and hints of almond nuttiness on the tongue.  Rich and syrupy body with long aftertaste. Like a great Kona, only sweeter.


	Rusty and Lorie Obra started their Hawaiian coffee farm in , they stumbled upon an award-winning coffee region. Of course, they didn't know it at the time. The couple simply wanted to live in the Ka'u District, the southern side of the Big Island known for the Green Sand Beach near Ka Lae (South Point), the Punalu'u Black Sand Beach, and the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.


	Rusty, a retired chemist, arrived first. He took over  acres of an old sugarcane farm on the slope of the Mauna Loa volcano and started planting coffee trees. Lorie, a medical technologist, soon sold their New Jersey home and followed him to Hawaii.


	The couple quickly expanded their business to become farmers, processors and roasters of coffee. Because of their science background, the two ran their farm like a laboratory. They started testing different processing methods and roasts, looking for ones that would bring out the best flavors in their coffee. Rusty also organized the Ka'u Coffee Growers Cooperative, a group of about  Ka'u coffee farmers.


	Then Rusty passed away in , leaving Lorie at a crossroads. Could she handle the business with all of its manual labor on her own? Lorie thought about selling the farm, but she couldn't let go of Rusty's dream: to make Ka'u coffee one of the best in the world.


	In , Ka'u was vindicated at the Specialty Coffee Association of America's annual conference. Two of Lorie's fellow farmers in the Ka'u Coffee Growers Cooperative won th and th place in the Roaster's Guild Cupping Pavilion Competition. That same year, Rusty's Hawaiian was one of seven farms that ranked in the SCAA's top  Hawaii/Asia/Indonesia regional competition.


	The recognition and subsequent awards for Ka'u coffee -- strengthened Lorie's dedication. Lorie currently is president of the Ka'u Coffee Growers Cooperative. She was one of the organizers of the first Ka'u Coffee Festival, held in April . She also continues to refine the processing and roasting methods at Rusty's Hawaiian. She has been recognized by "Coffee Review: The World's Leading Coffee Buying Guide" for her "artisan meticulousness."

As an alternative, we are now offering the Kenya Gachatha Unicorn Peaberry



	We couldn't be more excited to introduce our newest coffee from the Gachatha cooperative.  We had Apricot, Blackberry, Raspberry, Currant, Cherry, Black Tea, Raw Sugar. It's so balanced and complex with a juicy body and an aftertaste that lingers forever and you keep wanting more.  Why do we call this coffee "Unicorn"? Read the story about this bean written by one of our importers from Red Fox Coffee Merchants, Aleco Chigounis.
	

Living in the Bay were fortunate to be around some of the American wine industrys finest participants, from importers, to bars and shops, to natural winemakers in Sonoma county and beyond. Its a beautiful place to be and we often find ourselves sharing anecdotes with our pals on that side of the fence. One of my favorite terms used by wine folk is unicorn wine. A unicorn wine is a wine that everyone talks about, a wine that everyone wants to drink, but a wine that is very rarely found on shelves or even tucked away in the deepest cellar in Berkeley.
	

	Its a dreamy concept that instantly makes me think of the tales of grandeur Ive been hearing for years from some of the elder coffee statesmen that I respect most; romantic rants about the lucid blackcurrant and blackberry flavor of the most exquisite Kenyan coffees; conversations that habitually end with the lament that Kenya just isnt quite what it used to be, that maybe, although forever and always a complex player, Kenya doesnt quite offer the power and the purity that it once did.
	

	I would classify todays Kenya offering as a unicorn coffee. To put it simply, this AA lot from Gachatha offers unadulterated flavor. Its pure. Its sweetness is perfect. The aromatics are fragrant, fresh peach blossoms. Cup character? Take those sweet floral aromatics and turn them into ripe peach and creme fraiche with a drizzle of wildflower honey on top. The acidity? Dramatic. Think fresh redcurrant, golden raspberry, and the whole dang basket of ripe stone fruits from cherry to apricot. This is the best Kenyan coffee I remember purchasing in years. Maybe ever. We scored the arrival . The AB is every bit as sweet and wild, just slightly more contained. A stunner of a coffee nonetheless -- we scored it  on arrival. If this Gachatha outturn doesnt rival those mythical lots from the s, s and s, then I say they truly no longer exist. Maybe they never did. - Aleco Chigounis (Red Fox Coffee Merchants)
	

The Gacatha Unicorn received  points from Coffee Review!

	Blind Assessment: Extraordinary authority and complexity. Honey, complexly-expressed flowers - lavender, lilac - candied grapefruit, underlying suggestions of sweet herb. Sweetly and richly bright acidity; buoyantly syrupy mouthfeel.  Finishes with immense sweetness and a crisp, drying edge.
 - Ken Davids (Coffee Review)

ROAST: Medium
NOTES: Washed process


The La Montaa which is also a neighboring farm from the well-know Pacamara, offers a beautiful fusion of bold chocolate and bright fruit nuances. It starts with a sweet champorado (chocolate rice porridge) mixed with subtle graham crackers and citrus notes in aroma.  The cup brings out flavors dark chocolate, subtle spices with a lingering orange creamsicle and berry finish. Overall, this coffee presents a sweet, full body with medium acidity, giving you a reason to come back for more!
	
	Las Mercedes is made up of three farms and several micro-lots. One of the farms we visited was La Montaa which is not too far from the mill where workers were picking and sorting the days harvest. This was the lot used by  World Barista Champion Alejandro Mendez to win the National Championship in El Salvador. Lucia and Don Roberto are very concerned with quality and at the farm level, it starts with careful picking and sorting of ripe cherries only. 
	
	What makes Las Mercedes special? To start, one cannot talk about Las Mercedes without sharing a bit about its history. Dating back to  when Mr. Adrian Ortiz, a Spanish Immigrant married Miss Mercedes Rivera and started to grow coffee at Finca Las Mercedes. The farm has been owned by five generations of the Ortiz family and survived many ups and downs including the civil war of the s and the earthquake of , which destroyed homes, buildings, clay patios and other farm infrastructure. It was then that Mr. Roberto Ortiz and his family decided to reinvest in the farm and community and produce world-class coffee. Obviously the efforts of the Ortiz family have paid off for both the farm and the community.
	
	The same care and consideration invested in the coffee is invested into the Las Mercedes community. The Ortiz Family has always been devoted to taking care of those who have helped in their success, by providing clothing, food and health care. In addition, Las Mercedes is constantly making efforts to preserve natural wild life by taking special care of the disposal of by-products from the mill in order to avoid contamination also, in compliance with our certifications, chemical and pesticides are carefully store and managed by trained personnel, avoiding intoxication and contamination. In the last years, a great effort has been made in planting native trees to preserve these species.

VARIETAL: Typica + Bourbon
FARM: Las Serranias
ALTITUDE:  M
FARMER: Various
ROAST: Medium
NOTES:  points by Coffee Review


	This is a "natural" processed decaffeinated coffee or otherwise known as the sugar cane method. Let us take you to Dorkville real quick to provide some insight one what this specific decaffeination process is and how it affects the overall flavor of the coffee. Basically there are four basic decaffeination process that we know of or have been introduced so far. They are the Direct Solvent, Indirect Solvent, Swiss Water and Co.  
	
	For this specific coffee, we're going to focus on the Solvent based process. Now don't freak out. Let us expand on what this process actually is. To simplify, this processes is when the caffeine is removed from the beans with the help of a chemical solvent, such as methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. Those solvent based processes in turn can be divided into methods using the direct method and the indirect method. 
	
	This specific coffee goes through the "indirect" process. What that mean is, instead of applying the solvent chemical directly onto the beans, the beans are soaked in near boiling water for several hours, which extracts the caffeine as well as other flavor elements and oils from the beans. The water is then separated and transferred to another tank where the beans are washed for about  hours with either methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. The molecules of the chemical solvent selectively bond with the molecules of caffeine and the resulting mixture is then heated to evaporate the solvent and caffeine.
	
	Lastly, the beans are reintroduced to the liquid to reabsorb most of the coffee oils and flavor elements.
However, because of the impracticality of gathering natural ethyl acetate and its cost, the chemical used for decaffeination appears to be synthetic. Ethyl acetate is produced commercially from ethyl alcohol and acetic acid, which in turn may be produced from natural ingredients or petroleum derivatives.
In the direct method caffeine is removed by soaking the materials directly in a solvent; the solvent is directly applied to the beans. 
	
	Las Serranias is graded "A" decaffeinated process that uses a derivative from sugar-cane known as Ethel Acetate (EA). The pleasing characteristic from the sugar cane adds to the sweet acidity and banana, apricot and cream notes. More importantly, It's not giving the dirty flavors most decaffeinated coffees are associated with. Overall, it's a well structured, smooth, and balanced coffee.
	
	Although Las Serranias is not a part of the Las Mingas Project directly, it was produce by the founders. Las Mingas Project promotes coffee relatinships, a partnership that brings producers, exporters, and roasters together to collaborate. Giving farmers bargaining power and receive honest pricing for trading practices. La Serrania came directly from Virmax, a premier exporter of Colombian Specialty Coffees that works under Direct Relationship model. 
	
	Without a doubt, decaf drinker or not, you will appreciate and adore Las Serranias. Kenneth Davids from Coffee Review scored Las Serranias  points and stated this decaf as "delicately rich and fruit-toned. In the aroma distinct cocoaish chocolate complicated by fresh-cut fir. In the cup soft, wine-like acidity, lightly syrupy mouthfeel, and continued fruit-inflected chocolate."

	The world's oldest and most well known blend. In the cup richly balanced; delicate fruit and floral top notes with deeper hints of earth and brandy-toned chocolate and aromatic wood.
	This version of the ancient Mocha-Java blend combines a genuine Java from the government estates of East Java with two different Ethiopia "natural" or dried-in-the-fruit coffees, both of which represent variations on the original Yemen Mocha component of the blend: one from the Harrar region of Ethiopia and a second from the Amaro region of southwestern Ethiopia.
	Ken Davids noted this coffee  - "Intense aroma: brandyish fermented fruit, sweet-toned flowers and aromatic wood. In the cup richly balanced; delicate fruit and floral top notes with deeper hints of earth, brandy-toned chocolate and aromatic wood. These deeper tones carry into a mildly but distinctly astringent finish."

This specific blend is a combination of the st place - Olmedo Rodriguez and rd place - Eugene Sarria. Each cup offered a dynamic flavor profile that became more evident in the cup after the blending process. The cup brings out a beautiful fusion of sweet milk chocolate, almonds and hints of kiwi and lime.

	This delicate and multifaceted bean offers distinct flavors of cinnamon, chocolate chip cookie and honey along with lime citrus and cherry undertones. 
	

	The well-known Buf Cafe washing station is located high up in the mountains near the village of Karaba, Ginkongoro (south-central Rwanda). Epiphanie Muhirwa is a superstar in global specialty, a living emblem of Rwandan economic recovery through top-grade specialty coffee. Buf Cafe started operation in the year , after funding aid from the Rwandan Development Bank and USAIDs PEARL project, directly paid for by United States taxpayers. Sam Muhirwa, Epiphanies son, now oversees daily operations at Buf Cafe.
	

	The coffee collected and processed by Buf is special, though the relationship it has to the surrounding community is somewhat opaque. Buf Cafe is a private washing station, owned wholly by the Muhirwa family, processing coffee cherry from two distinct cooperatives in the Ginkongoro prefecture: Cobabakagi ( members) and Terimbere Kawa Yacu (between - members). They also collect cherry from farmers in other regions, siphoning away outside cooperative output by placing collection sites within the operating zones of other established groups. 
	

	Buf Cafe operates two separate washing stations  Nyrusiza and Remera. The larger of the two, Remera sits at  meters, and on the drive there we reached hilltop elevations nearing  meters. You can feel Buf Cafes elevation simply hiking around the mill, not to mention the endless vantage points stretching out hundreds of miles to the north from Bufs verdant green box canyon setting. This is the highest elevation washing station well visit all week long in Rwanda, and it feels like it. Processing here follows the Rwandan standard, with a floating tank sort, - hour dry fermentation, second sort for weight using water shoots, then a  hour soak prior to hand washing and hand sorting, concluded by placement on a dramatic tableau of raised drying beds on the mountain valley floor. Similar practices are followed at Nyarusiza. Contributing farmers grow Bourbon, Jackson, and Mbezi coffee varieties, a tree triumvirate ubiquitous across the coffee lands of Rwanda.

Story of the bean: In the s, coffee consumption was beginning to soar and Brazilian coffee producers struggled to find a coffee tree that could withstand the strong winds and rain in the tropical savannas south of the Amazon. The solution was a hybrid plant called Catuai, a highly productive dwarf variety prized for its sweetness. With rich chocolate flavor and a full body, the Blue Diamond is a shining example of a Brazilian Catuai.

Why you'll love it: Not only does this coffee taste delicious and refreshing when brewed hot or cold, it also represents a commitment to support and nurture the Haitian coffee industry.
Story of the bean: Farmers from the highest mountains of Southeastern Haiti overlooking the Caribbean grow coffee the way it has been done for two-hundred years - on small, family-owned farms alongside a diverse mix of shade trees, banana plants, and ground crops. Women cheerfully process and sort the coffee and load up the best grades for export on the colorful Tap Tap trucks to be delivered to the shipyards of Port Au Prince.
The resulting elegant, velvety-smooth coffee is a perfect example of what we mean by a culinary coffee and stands as a testimony to the abiding smallholder Haitian farmers with whom we are excited to have this historic partnership.

Why youll love it:The effects of high altitudes give this coffee flowery notes of rose and honeysuckle that arerarely seen in a Mexican coffee.
 Story of the bean:Grown on the western slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur mountain range, this lot was provided by the members of the SICOBI cooperative. These heirloom typica plants take on intense floral aromas due to the high altitudes and cold evening temperatures they endure. Colder nights cause the plant to naturally send more sugar to it's cherries in order to protect the seeds, resulting in a more intensely sweet and floral cup of coffee.The cooperative where this coffee comes from has over  producing members, and was founded by a group of biologists called GAIA, an NGO working to preserve biodiversity in the Sierra Madre del Sur. Each year, cooperative members in the surrounding communities take more and more control over the business, increasing the quality of the coffee. We are looking forward to many more seasons of exceptional coffee from this cooperative and from this region of Mexico.

Why You'll Love it:This complex coffee from the Indonesian island of Sumatra was processed with a unique method that produces beautiful, aromatic notes of fruits and herbs.
Story of the bean:In the Northern regions of Sumatra, small land-holders use an unorthodox coffee processing method called "Giling Basah." Thisfruit-removalprocess is unique to Indonesia because although the altitude and soil of Sumatra can produce outstanding coffees, the humid air and constant rains make it difficult to dry the coffee slowly as is done in much of the rest of the world. Giling Basah or"wet hulling" is responsible for the complexly sweet flavors in this coffee. These beans were wet-hulled and dried in the sun, resulting in a lightly tart, syrupy brew with notes of pear and juniper.

How do I pick a coffee? Baffled about which coffee to pick? Take our Coffee Quiz! Or feel free to give us a call or email us (--- or help@lacolombe.net. Our Coffee Crew would love to help you find a coffee that suits your taste buds.  What are cupping notes? Does this mean your coffee is flavored? Our coffees do not contain added flavors. However, each of our single-origin coffees and blends has its own unique flavor. Those flavors and aromas come naturally from the coffee bean and can be affected by factors like country of origin, altitude, growing practices, processing techniques, and roasting styles. Coffees roasted more lightly have more of the characteristics unique to eachorigin, while those roasted on a darker level have more of the classic chocolatey and smoky tones found in our Classic and Reserve Blends.  The tasting notes that youll find on your bag of La Colombe coffee are what we taste when we brew and drink the coffee. By creating a simile between what were tasting in the coffee and familiar flavors weve had before (chocolate, apple pie, toasted marshmallow, etc.), its easier to communicate the often complex tastes that coffee can take on.  What grind should I choose? The choice of grind will depend on how you brew your coffee. Usually, we recommend ordering your coffee whole bean and grinding it fresh before you brew. But if you dont have a good-quality grinder, let us pre-grind it for you! We recommend the following grinds for specific brewing methods: Drip for regular automatic drip coffee machines Melitta/Chemex for pourovers Turkish a fine grind for Turkish coffee French Press a semi-coarse grind for immersion methods Home Espresso a fine grind for home espresso machines Commercial Espresso an even finer finer for commercial espresso machines Percolator a grind only to be used for a percolator coffee maker  Why does grind size matter? Read more here. What are your caf location and hours? Our national locations and hours can be found at our Cafs page here at this link.
What is the best way to store coffee? The best way to store coffee in an airtight container in a dark cupboard. Theres no need to freeze! Just keep your beans away from sunlight, air, and humidity.  How long is the shelf life? We recommend drinking your bagged coffee within  weeks of the roasting date. The coffee will not spoil after this date, but it will lose the amazing aromas and flavors we strive for in roasting.  Our cans of coffee remain fresh for about a year.  Our Pure Black cold-pressed bottled coffee has a shelf life of - weeks.  How do I brew coffee? There are infinite ways to brew coffee, and all coffee folks have their own strong opinions as to what makes the best cup. For our recommendations, check out our brewing tips video or our blog.  What is the difference between classics, reserves and single origins? What are seasonal single origins blends? At La Colombe, we have three different coffee lines. Classic Blends are our cornerstone blends that have been here since the very beginning. These are the coffees we drink on a daily basis, and if youre new to La Colombe, we recommend checking them out! Reserve Blends are modern and refined specialty blends take you on a journey of different flavors, all while remaining within the traditional coffee wheelhouse. Workshop Coffees are roasted in small batches and come from a single origin, usually a single farm or specific region of a country. Our seasonal Workshop blends are comprised of multiple unique, single-origin coffees.  How do I return a product I did not like? If you dont like a coffee weve sent you, no worries at all.

Here at La Colombe, we are keenly aware of where our coffee comes from, how it was grown, and, most importantly, the needs of the people involved in the coffees journey from seed to cup. We care deeply about the wellbeing of coffee-growing communities, and we strive to implement the best business practices to increase that wellbeing.
As one of the early pioneers of direct trade, we pride ourselves on proactive, longterm relationships with small-holder farms and socially responsible coffee-growing associations. For us, the quality of our coffee starts with the quality of these relationships. By working directly with farmers to create mutually beneficial partnerships, we can increase transparency in the supply chain, guide farming practices to yield better and better beans, and support the livelihoods of coffee-producing communities.
Founded in  by La Colombe and the Clinton Foundation, the Haiti Coffee Academy supports coffee farmers in the southeast region of Haiti through education, training, materials, and market access.
Haiti is a place that is close to our hearts, and a place where coffee production has suffered in recent decades. We are committed to supporting the Haitian coffee industry by buying a significant amount of Haitian coffee each year and bringing their beautiful beans to the U.S. craft coffee market. Learn more about the Haiti Coffee Academy here.
Around the world, millions of people and thousands of communities lack access to clean drinking water. We believe that access to water is an inherent human right, and we partner with organizations who share this philosophy. By providing free drinking water in our cafes, we seek to raise awareness about water initiatives in the hopes that one day, everyone will have equal access to this life-giving resource.
Fairness  All trading partners are to be treated fairly. No strike price is ever to be below that established by the Fair Trade Organization. Additionally, farm workers' wages must be verifiable fair, working conditions must be humane and basic health must be made available.
Longevity  Long-term commitments are to be established with all coffee sources, thereby providing a more certain future for our trading partners.
Opportunity  Priority is given to nations, regions and farmers with the greatest need and where our purchases can make the greatest impact.
Water  Access to clean drinking water must be provided by the farmer to the families associated with our supplier farms.
Strictly Earth Conscious Earth Conscious coffees are coffees grown on farms that hold at least two earth friendly certifications.
In addition to supporting our coffee-producing communities, we seek to support, nurture, and enhance the local neighborhoods that are home to our cafes. From providing free coffee to a nearby homeless shelter to helping with the community garden across the street, we work hard to engage with our environment and create meaningful connections with our neighbors.

Today, SFMOMA is hosting a Topping Out event in Jesse Square park, where everyone can witness the highest beam lifted into place on their expanded building.  It’s hard to believe that over a year has passed since the SFMOMA ground breaking ceremony, where we marked the occasion with a site-specific cookie wall.   While we won’t be participating in today’s events, we wanted to share these photos taken on a shoot in July, commemorating a building that today reaches new heights, always deserving of a celebration, and happens to look great as a dessert.
Originally, we created this layered dessert, inspired by Mario Botta’s iconic striated turret, for a press event introducing Snohetta’s plans for  SFMOMA’s expansion.  Alternating layers of black cocoa cake and whipped cream topped with a chocolate sable were diligently stacked in these perfect glass votives that Caitlin found on a whim.
We were adamant about getting the dessert turret documented with the architectural turret it was inspired by.  So we packed up the camera, a pint of whipping cream, and a whisk and headed downtown where we whipped the cream and assembled the dessert on site.  Which happened to be outside at the fountain area just across the street from the museum we remember and love.  And now whenever I pass it, I think of all the amazing art-inspired desserts we got to make within the building, and how much fun is yet to be had outside of it.  Like whipping cream in situ.
Two of our favorite and most frequent visitors to the rooftop coffee bar were curators of Architecture and Design, Jennifer Dunlop Fletcher and Joseph Becker.  They would come up for their morning espresso drinks, sometimes again for a meeting in the afternoon and if the timing was right, I would poke my head out from the kitchen to say a quick hello and inquire about any creative endeavors.  In their open and generous manner, they would update us on what they were working on next or who they were meeting while they waited (never too long) for their drinks. In exchange, I would usually give them a taste of what we were working on.  These brief exchanges would often turn into collaborations on a special event or a dessert.   On a tour with Jennifer through the Buckminster Fuller exhibition, as it was being installed, the creation of the Buckminster Fuller Hot Chocolate was finalized when we saw the magazine cover of the proposed floating village in a vitrine.  
It was always a treat to correspond with people who reply to emails with enthusiasm and in some case with thoughts they might have on art that would make a good dessert.  Like these from Joseph:
Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, ‘Dropped Cone’ ()
and Le Corbusier…too architectural? But what about a chocolate meringue Ronchamp? Yum!
This time two years ago,  Field Conditions opened.  This exhibition of “spatial experiments”, included nearly  works by artists and architects, and entirely in black, white and shades of grey.   For the opening event, the A+D department partnered with SFMOMA’s education team who had scheduled a program in conjunction with the San Francisco Electronic Music Festival to celebrate John Cage.

We were already fans of Tauba Auerbach’s work, from the  SECA exhibition which was up when we first opened the rooftop coffee bar, so it was no surprise that her “/ Floor” appealed to us.   The giant floor-tile installation, (coupled with a kinetic light installation by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer) is made of % black tiles and % white tiles, which are randomly distributed over the floor in a QR code–like pattern.  Could we do a Mondrian-style cake that when cut into could be photographed with a QR code reader and take you to a website? We dreamed in black and white. 
Tauba Auerbach, / Floor (detail) installed in Field Conditions, ;  photo: Rocor
As the installation of the / floor neared completion, we got word at the side kitchen door that there were a few square feet of the black and white tile left.  I asked Joseph if we could use it for the event to serve the series of black and white crackers we were working.  In minutes we had them in the kitchen and started working on some spreads for the crackers.  I acquired some squid ink from our friend Stuart at State Bird Provisions and waited for Tess, (a vegan whom I care for dearly and who, I was afraid would never come back to work if she had to witness squid ink in our sweet little production kitchen), to leave for the day before I attempted to color match our house-made ricotta to the black tile.
photo courtesy of Lanlian Szeto of SFMOMA, thankfully she took this, because it’s the only documentation we have of the whole process/event!
Here, Tess Wilson and I are setting up what we like to affectionately call Tauba’s “Auer-crack-ers”.  We set up black and white tiles that functioned as serving plates for the crackers buttermilk (white) and black charcoal (black).  Guests were invited to choose their own spread (which we couldn’t help ourselves refer to as grout) from a selection of housemade squid ink ricotta, white bean hummus, black sesame spread and whipped ricotta.  Everyone was entertained at the thought that they were essentially “eating off the floor” and delighted to get to take their tile home as a memento.
I just learned that today, August th , is National Dog Day! In lieu of bombarding you with videos of cute dogs eating cake, I thought this would be a perfect occasion to share some photos of the time we made dog biscuits for humans.   Last January, the Roxie Theater screened Mike Mills’  film Beginners as part of an event for SFMOMA’s Live Projects series.As frequent SFMOMA collaborators, we set up a table at the front of the theatre to serve ticket holders New Orlean’s Iced Coffee and bags of dog treats to eat at specific points throughout the film. 
The audience, fully caffeinated and captivated as they listen to director Mike Mills in conversation with SFMOMA’s Gina Basso about the film and his recent commission for Project Los Altos.
In Beginners, Oliver (played by Ewan McGregor) inherits a Jack Russell, Arthur (played by Cosmo), from his father after he dies. For those who haven’t seen the film, Arthur has subtitles. This could be taken for him “talking,” but Mills suggests that the dog’s subtitles throughout the movie are “a way to externalize a character who was sometimes non-verbal.”  
While we are huge Mike Mills fans, nothing gets our attention like a cute dog and the delight at what ensues when that cute dog “talks”:  the sound of  bags of cookies rustling at various points throughout a film.  
When Design*Sponge approached me about building a photo backdrop for their book release party, I instantly arranged a meeting (drinks at Locanda) with Leah Rosenberg, my dear friend, boss, and partner-in-cake-crime. Though Leah’s an incredible painter, and I like to dabble in embroidery and flower-arranging, when we work together there’s generally baking involved. Leah’s the head pastry chef for Blue Bottle Coffee in SFMOMA’s Rooftop Sculpture Garden, and I’m her assistant, and we’re happiest when we’re working up there in our little 'x’ kitchen. Our brainstorming session yielded quite a few excellent, edible ideas that we would need serious grant money to pull off, but our favorite reasonable one was the notion of a wall of cookies. The Glamorous Wall Of Cookies… Guests could have their picture taken, eat a cookie, and feel at peace with the world.
We went to work. I made a test batch of cookies just to play with sprinkles and such. I had the invaluable help of an enthusiastic -year-old, obviously a sprinkle & lustre-dust prodigy (she also took the photo).
Using the random marker colors we had on hand, Leah & I did a (very, very rough) sketch of the cookie wall, to entice the Design*Sponge team. They liked it! The Glamorous Wall of Cookies was a go.
I created a game plan in an Excel document to keep us on track. I don’t know if you can read my writing, but the only thing checked off is “Make a pointless Excel document”. 
Next, I grabbed a piece of wood and a few nails from home and brought them to the tiny kitchen. We experimented with making holes in the cookies and hanging them from the wood, creating what I like to call The Hobo Wall Of Terror.  Don’t be scared, it’s all part of the process.
Now that we felt confident that it was possible to hang cookies on a wall, we crunched the numbers and got started making  cookies. Remember: 'x’ kitchen. Our mixer can handle enough dough to make about  cookies, so we would be making  or  batches. As you can tell from her paintings and art cakes, Leah is incredibly skilled at creating and combining colors so she tinted her cookies confidently, but I still have so much to learn.
I tinted small amounts of dough at a time, scared I would ruin an entire batch.  This actually ended up working fine, as we were so inspired by Julia Rothman’s book tour illustrations. We wanted to capture all the subtle colors she used, as well as the d*s ribbons and the gorgeous book cover.
We punched holes in each one (we discovered that old-fashioned paper straws worked best).
And once all the cookies were baked, carefully layered them in Cambros, labeled with their quantity & (occasionally questionable) colors.
All the while, the task of building an actual wall (that could hold  cookies and wouldn’t fall on people) loomed. We admitted we’re really more cake-bakers than wall-builders, so we outsourced to our immensely talented friend Sam of Synth Island, who whipped up an elegant, sturdy design.  The three of us took a fieldtrip to Discount Builders, where every single person working helped us. They were all patient, efficient, friendly, and truly helpful.
We’d brought cookie “swatches” which we intended to share with all the employees….until I set them down in the wet color sample the nice paint boys whipped up for us. You see, it’s not enough to see what the cookies look like nearby the paint color- they really need to be all up in it. From the beginning, I’d been envisioning colorful cookies on a gold background- gold to reference the book cover and to add plenty of glamour. Leah gently reminded me that no paint would create the true-gold background I dreamed of- for that, we would need to gold-leaf the wall (we would still love to do this, so please contact us if you need a gold-leafed wall full of possibly edible-gold-leafed cookies. It would be gorgeous..). Instead of settling for a trying-to-be-gold-but-really-yellow effect, Leah had the great idea of using the pretty grey of the Design*Sponge website. When I put the cookies in the paint, the colors really popped, so we were satisfied.
We found everything we needed, and loaded it up in a Zipcar (one of  vehicle rentals involved in this project- none of us have a car, and I don’t even have a license).
The actual wall had to be built on the sidewalk in front of Sam’s apartment, as San Francisco apartments cannot accommodate very much lumber. Leah & I gridded out the holes for all of the nails (that took a few attempts), deciding to hang  cookies on each nail so the colors would change throughout the night of the party. I drilled, I broke the drillbit, she drilled, nailed, and painted, and I tried not to break anything else.  The day of the party arrived and Leah baked the hundreds of cookies in our little oven (referred to affectionately by guests as our Easy-Bake Oven). Our friend Kelly volunteered to be Leah’s lovely cookie wall assistant at the party, since I would be out of town. Excitement was running high! We love Design*Sponge, we love baking, and we love outlandish projects- I hope everyone at the event had as much fun as we did making the cookie wall!
Here are some photos taken at the event at Anthropologie.  You can see  Blair Sneddon’s photos of guests posing in front of the wall eating their cookies here!

Alejandro Cartagena, Fragmented Cities, Juarez #, from the series Suburbia Mexicana,   // Cartagena Ice Cream + Sorbet Trio // ©Modern Art Desserts
We featured our Cartagena Ice Cream and Sorbet Trio in Modern Art Desserts, but didn’t get to include the story (or picture) of when we fed Alejandro Cartagena (the artist, himself!) the trio of ice creams and sorbets. He and Pablo Lopez Luz, another artist featured in the Photography in Mexico exhibition, were in town for the opening celebration, and we were delighted to invite him up to try our finalized (just in time for the opening!) dessert.
 Alejandro Cartagena and Pablo Lopez Luz eat some ice cream!
We learned earlier on that it is best to get a sense of an upcoming show ahead of time, to talk to curators as they are planning the exhibition, to get inside scoops from the museum install crew, to make the most successful rendition of a dessert based on an artwork.  Often, extra time was needed to get the approval of the artist, or to work out serving details, or to order ribbon…from Canada. 
But none of this mattered when I discovered one Wednesday night in April that Mary Heilmann was giving a lecture downstairs at the Wattis Theatre the following night.  Mary Heilmann  is my favorite artist. I could go on about how her work got me through grad school, but best to cut to the part about cake.
I didn’t sleep that night – Mary Heilmann’s paintings playing like a slide show through my head – each one a possible dessert.  I thought about just going to the lecture, sitting on the edge of my seat and on her every word, but it would be a dream come true to meet her in person.  And if I met her in person, I would have to make her a dessert.  This is, afterall, why we were there doing what we did in the tiny kitchen at SFMOMA.  For moments like this. And this, and this, and even this.  
Mary Heilmann, Fire and Ice Remix/ sketch by Leah for Fire and Ice dessert
I had to carefully plan the following day, already packed with regular production, meetings and whatever else comes up in a day, in order to make something for Mary with the time and resources available.   Maybe all this sounds a bit crazy-making.  Or maybe, it sounds a bit like art-making.  Whatever it was, on April , , thanks to some fancy facilitating by SFMOMA Public Programs Associate, Gina Basso, I got to meet Mary and Mary got an impromptu dessert based on her painting Fire and Ice Remix.   This Red Hot Red Velvet Cake with crème fraiche-spiked cream cheese frosting and buttermilk ice milk was made once and never again, what one might call an Artist Proof in the printmaking world,  I suppose. 
In the time between a tech run-through and her lecture, Gina brought Mary Heilmann up to the rooftop for a cake and ice cream remix of her Fire and Ice Remix.  
While the dessert might not have been perfect, it was eaten and now is gone.  Which thankfully, is not the case with the painting that inspired it. One week after her lecture, I received this sweet note in my inbox from Mary (herself!).  Even her emails turned to art. 
“Leah   Thank you  again  for the beautiful  Fire and Ice Dessert…..  
I even saved some and brought it                                                                                                               home to new york and ate it when I got home.Hey here it is I ’ll never forget   Love Mary H”
For years, Tony Cragg's Guglie was the first artwork we would see as we emerged from the elevator and out into the SFMOMA rooftop pavilion.  For months, we had been thinking about building a striped frozen mousse using a cone shaped mold, but we had to be practical about time and freezer space.  With the Robert Frank show about to come down (and therefore our float), another ice cream based treat to replace it was on our minds.

Sometimes the artwork would tell us what it needed to be and this time it begged us to be an ice cream cone.  In this case, the perfect flavor and hue of ice cream already existed, so it didn’t take much to call up our friends at Humphry Slocombe to send over a couple of buckets of their Strawberry Sorbet (Salted Caramel replaced this in the winter) and Malted Milk Chocolate to match the sculpture. Our true work would lie then on creating a custom cone wrapper (and eventually, on the warm days, non stop ice cream scooping).
Here is Caitlin’s first test. Turns out some extra math was required, as we needed the stripes to match up just right.
Where we would often find ourselves toiling away in the kitchen testing recipes, trying to get flavors and textures just right, this time we brought out the paint box to engineer a custom sleeve so we could transform what was once was a brown sugar waffle cone into… a Cragg cone!
Before Modern Art Desserts (the book) came along, a photographer from the SFMOMA had been the primary chronicler of our desserts. Charlie Villyard, member of the installation crew and talented photographer, would come up every few months and document all of the goodies we had been making. And one of our very favorite shots he ever took was this one of our Tony Cragg ice cream cone.
Here he is, doing whatever needs to be done to get the shot right. But quickly, before the ice cream melts!
Since the Cragg piece was installed in the pavilion and not the main galleries, it was one of the rare occasions in which you could eat the dessert you ordered right in next to the artwork that inspired it.  An even rarer occasion was purposefully scooping ice cream directly onto the floor!
After a visit to SFMOMA from LA, a relative of mine gave me this.  He had saved his cone wrapper, collaged it onto a photograph he took of the Tony Cragg piece and put it in a frame.
Sometimes a sculpture inspires an ice cream cone.  Sometimes an ice cream cone inspires a collage.
You can see the Cragg Cone (in its upright state) and the recipe on page  of Modern Art Desserts. And in case you want to dress your cones this summer in stripes, we made a template that you can download here.
Today we celebrate National Ice Cream Day with a couple of art-inspired ice cream sandwiches! You can thank President Ronald Reagan, who in , designated the third Sunday in July as National Ice Cream Day.  Clearly exhibiting his good sense when it comes to sweets, he carried on to proclaim the entire month of  July as National Ice Cream Month.  In the proclamation, President Reagan (who also had an affinity for jelly beans!) called for all people of the United States to observe these events with “appropriate ceremonies and activities.”

Caitlin’s sketchbook detailing Joel Shapiro Ice Cream Sandwich recipe and flavors.
We designed this dessert- a layer of strawberry and then lavender ice cream sandwiched between two vanilla ice box cookies (one with a black stripe and the other with a yellow stripe) for the   SFMOMA Art Auction.  When SFMOMA asked us to do a special something for the upcoming art auction, we explored a few ideas before settling on this ice cream treat based on Joel Shapiro’s  Untitled pastel drawing.  Earlier on, we mocked up thoughts for  Liz Larner chocolate dipped potato chips in which house-made potato chips would be dipped in a black cocoa-tobacco chocolate shell.  We considered a mondrian-style cake that reveals a colorful Mark Grotjahn burst.
The Joel Shapiro ice cream sandwich was a rendition of our Agnes Martin version we created  in  while her paintings were on view for the exhibition, Calder to Warhol,  introducing the Fisher Collection and celebrating the museum’s th anniversary.  Subtle bands of cream, parchment and a glaze of creamy yellow inn Martin’s painting Wheat were translated into delicious, quiet layers of rose mastic ice milk, chamomile ice cream contained between two buckwheat biscuits. 
Over the years, we created a few more art-inspired ice cream-focused treats, which can all be found with inspirational stories and recipes in the Modern Art Desserts book.  Hopefully there are enough of them to get you through to the end of this ice cream focused month… consider it your patriotic duty to enjoy them!
Not long ago, I mentioned baseball in a post and assured you it would be the only time you would catch me referencing sports.  Since then,  I have attended two Giants games at AT&T park and a few days after that listened to the Mets playing the Giants in the kitchen, while I was playing with cookie dough. 
At the stadium, watching the game live,  I had a bit of a hard time following the innings and strike outs, as I found myself more taken by the bountiful bouquets of cotton candy bouncing up and down the stairways across the stadium.  Or the way a vendor would hand a churro to a customer as if they were passing the baton in an Olympic relay.  The best , though, was the fellow, armed with a holster of whipped cream around his waist, who floated up and down our row suited with a back pack of hot chocolate.
Surely by now you are wondering where this is going or get to the part about baseball already.  Perhaps by now you are imagining Modern Art Desserts taking their Pop Art Corn to the bleachers? Or the Mondrian Cake served up alongside garlic fries and beer?   As these thoughts fleeted around between innings, so did the image of the late San Francisco artist, Jay DeFeo flying a Giants banner from the fire escape of her Fillmore Street apartment while “The Rose” (–) is removed via forklift.   
The Jay DeFeo Trust posted this gem right as the Giants sweep the World Series in  and DeFeo’s masterpiece was about to go on view at SFMOMA for her revelatory retrospective. During the exhibition walk through, one SFMOMA curator noted were DeFeo, an avid Giants fan, still with us today, you can bet she would have skipped the exhibition opening for the Giants homecoming parade. 
Although we have yet to make desserts (marshmallows!) based on baseball bases, we did create a dessert, our version of an Ile Flottante, based on one of DeFeo’s works that we offered while it was on view at SFMOMA. 
The Illustrated History of the Universe is an oil painting featuring a deceptively simple white disc floating asymmetrically against an impasto grey ground. Its complexity lies in how the layered textures convey three-dimensionality.  I love that you can see the artist’s handprint on the bottom left. 
So, although I can’t give you a play-by-play of the nine innings of the Giants game I attended since my attention was drawn to other things, I can give you step-by-step instructions on how to knock this DeFeo dessert out of the park.  The photos that follow were all taken by Willa Koerner - at SFMOMA (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art).
Step : beat powdered sugar with egg whites. //  Step : pile the sugar + egg mixture into a piping bag- and also fold caramelized cocoa nibs into fluff before loading the mixture into the piping bag- details, details!
Step : Pipe the meringues (an Ateco  tip is what we used).  // Step : Bake meringues at  degrees for  hour and let them cool in the oven overnight.
Step : Dip the meringues in (all organic) chocolate magic shell.
Step : Allow the shell to harden in a cool spot and remove from sheet tray.  Store in freezer until ready to serve.
Step :  Spread the the creamy base (which is a black sesame creme anglaise) like you are applying an impasto layer of paint to a canvas.
Step :  Float the meringue on the creme anglaise and sprinkle with charcoal sea salt.
Step :  Eat, enjoy!  And then maybe take yourself to a ball game.
When one thinks about art and tomato soup, Warhol’s screen prints of soup cans probably come to mind.
Here is Caitlin pointing them out when we were visting MOMA during our visit to New York last spring.
Warhol’s screen prints might also come to mind when one thinks about themes of seriality and repetition in art.  So too might Minimalist artist Donald Judd's  stack pieces that focus on “real materials in real space” and their purity of form.

Last year when his painting Untitled  was on view as part of the Permanent Collection exhibition on the th floor of SFMOMA, we made a minimalist soup in reference to the minimalist work.   Donald Judd’s birthday was last week and I wanted to make this soup for the occasion and float a candle in it, but it has been outrageously warm here and it didn’t seem right to post about a hot soup.  That said, word on the field is that Dirty Girl Farms just got their second wave of tomatoes in the ground this weekend that will be ready for harvest in August.  If you can’t wait until then, or are eager to make this soup for someone’s birthday like we were, you could use the whole peeled tomatoes by Jovial.
The day we photographed this up on the SFMOMA rooftop last year, was a perfect day for soup. 
And while this soup does a lousy job at holding a birthday candle it really does look like Judd’s Untitled!  Have a look for yourself!
Epilogue:  It occurred to me that Donald Judd and Andy Warhol have more in common than repetition in art.  They also have tomatoes…or would have had tomatoes in common had we actually gone through with this Bloody Mary Jell-o we were testing in response to this savory palette self portrait. 
This sketch by Caitlin is far more delicious than the Jell-o itself.  Trust us, eating paper would be more delicious than eating this particular Jell-o.  And although this is a place where we will share other failed attempts at creating edible artworks, this is the only time we will ever speak of this particular (and epically disgusting) Jell-o.

Coffee is a delicious, sweet, complex fruit. Plucked off its tree, it has a range of flavors that reflect its upbringing--cultivar, soil, pruning, and care. We work with producers who care for their trees as they would their children, giving them both the love and attention that they need to live up to their full potential. We walk with these producers through their small farms. We sleep on the farm, we breathe the farm, trying as hard as we can to understand how our producers make magic happen in our cups.
Our continual mission is to present these coffees to our customers in the same sublime condition that we tasted them, both by serving them seasonally, to preserve their freshness, and by roasting them with the intention of accentuating the intrinsic qualities within.

More than a decade ago, we crafted our own version of chicory-infused coffee for our farmers market stand. This fully organic, cold-brewed drink includes cane sugar and Clover whole milk. With the help of Fort Point Brewing, we've created our NOLA cartons with a single direction printed on them: Open.  We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

In the late s, the Turkish army swept across much of Eastern and Central Europe, arriving at Vienna in . Besieged and desperate, the Viennese needed an emissary who could pass through Turkish lines to get a message to the nearby Polish troops. Franz George Kolshitsky, who spoke Turkish and Arabic, took on the assignment disguised in a Turkish uniform. After many perilous close calls, Kolshitsky completed his valiant deed, returning to give the Viennese the news of the Poles imminent rescue of their city. On September , the Turks were repelled from Vienna, leaving everything they brought: camels, tents, honey, and strange bags of beans, which were thought to be camel feed. Kolshitsky, having lived in the Arab world for several years, knew these were bags of coffee. Using the money bestowed on him by the mayor of Vienna for his heroic deed, Kolshitsky bought the Turks coffee, opened Central Europes first coffee house (The Blue Bottle), and brought coffee to a grateful Vienna.

 years later, in Oakland, Calif., a slightly disaffected freelance musician and coffee lunatic, weary of the grande eggnog latte and the double skim pumpkin-pie macchiato, decided to open a roaster for people who were clamoring for the actual taste of freshly roasted coffee. Using a miniscule six-pound batch roaster, he made a historic vow: I will only sell coffee less than  hours out of the roaster to my customers, so they may enjoy coffee at its peak of flavor. I will only use the finest, most delicious and responsibly sourced beans. In honor of Kolshitskys heroics, he named his business Blue Bottle Coffee, and began another chapter in the history of superlative coffee.

Now, more than  years later and thanks to the enthusiastic support of many loyal customers, Blue Bottle Coffee has grown to a small network of cafes, wholesale partners, an espresso cart, and some vintage German coffee roasters. We are still united by the simple purpose of getting great coffee to everyone who asks for it. Improbably and delightfully, there are hundreds of us now. We roast coffee on vintage gear, put it in compostable bags, and still get it to our customers within  hours. We roast great coffee on two coasts, make great drinks, clean up after ourselves, bake cookies, type up invoices, get change at the bank, and say please and thank you. We offer the elderly and pregnant our seats on the bus and brush and floss daily. We look forward to seeing you soon.

The match made in heaven, from fog-heavy Alta Verapaz
The most coveted coffees on the planet, in a single package
Same as it was in , equal parts brilliance and utility 
Because it was conceived just . miles from our Oakland roastery by Aerobie (those wonderful folks who created an improbably long-flying disc), we'd like to humbly assert that the AeroPress is our first locally-produced piece of merchandise. Its a peculiar and lovely device  easily the most durable and portable option for brewing quality coffee. It produces a cup thats thick and focused, but still quite nuanced.
Comes with a set of  filters (and filter-holder), coffee grounds funnel, coffee scoop and stirring paddle.

Whether you are looking for an espresso grinder or a grinder to help you explore that extensive range of brew methods, the Encore is a great all around home grinder.
Over the years, the Maestro  has come to be lauded by coffee experts as THE go-to grinder for those who love both drip-coffee and manual brews. Building on that platform, Barazta has developed the Encore, with upgraded burrs to give a great grind for drip/manual brew and also fine enough for espresso. The Encore also has a completely new gearbox.

Featuring  individual grind settings, from fine to coarse, the Encore can please any palate with its gamut of accurate and repeatable grind settings. The Encore has an accurate medium to coarse grind for the increasingly popular manual brew methods such as pour-over, Aeropress, Siphon and Chemex. The specially designed burrs give a precise grind with minimal fines for a flavorful, balanced extraction when making espresso.

And, of course, the Encore is built with the quality Baratza parts youve come to trust. The efficient DC motor keeps your beans cool, even during extended grind times, while a combination of electric and gear speed reducers slow the burr to  RPM, ensuring a smooth bean feed and reducing noise, heat and static buildup.

Beyond a great coffee-drinking experience, the Encore makes for a great coffee-making experience. A convenient, front-mounted pulse button makes it easy to grind on demand into your brew basket. Whether you are looking for an espresso grinder or a grinder to help you explore that extensive range of brew methods, the Encore is a great all around home grinder.

Whether you are looking for an exceptional espresso grinder or a grinder to help you explore that extensive range of brew methods, the Preciso is the perfect grinder for you.
The Preciso is a beautifully designed conical burr coffee grinder that works as hard as you do to create the perfect espresso experience. It doesnt stop there of course; the Preciso has also received high marks from coffee experts as an exceptional grinder for the increasingly popular manual brew methods. The specially designed burrs give a precise grind with minimal fines for a flavorful, balanced extraction.

The Preciso is true to its name  a precision grinder with a micro-adjust system that can be dialed in like a commercial grinder. This, coupled with a coffee throughput that is  gram/second faster than other mm conical burr grinders, makes the Preciso exceptional for espresso. In addition to featuring Baratzas popular -grind adjustment options, the Preciso adds a second micro-adjustment level that further divides each of the  steps into  distinct settings. This means you have significantly more control over your espresso grind.

The Preciso features the quality internal parts and external elements youve come to expect from Baratza. It also comes equipped with our innovative PortaHolder, allowing you to grind your espresso hands-free, directly into the portafilter for quick setup and cleanup.

Great coffees balance sweetness, acidity and body to create the perfect cup of coffee. The Baratza Vario is a perfect example of a great grinder combining ease-of-use and a sleek appearance with a penchant for bringing out fantastic flavors in your beans.

This professional-grade grinder fits anywhere, from your kitchen to your office to your caf. While sporting a small footprint, the Vario features an impressive range of capabilities, boasting  distinct and repeatable grind settings from fine grind for espresso to course grind for press pot.

The design is beautiful as well as functional. Varios intuitive macro/micro adjustments make it easy to get the grind for a perfect espresso finish. Need something a little different? With a simple slide of the lever, you can switch from espresso to other coffee styles. And it couldnt be easier to get the perfect amount  digital timers and three user-programmable buttons make accurate one-touch dosing and repeatable grind times a snap.

The Varios unique mm ceramic flat burrs provide accurate, fast-grinding performance and remain sharp for twice as long as the best steel burrs. The high-torque DC motor and belt drive transmission mean your beans are in for a smooth, cool ride.

As always, its not just whats inside that matters; the Varios smooth operation carries over from internal to external, with front-mounted, easy-access control units, an  oz. grounds coffee collection bin, and Baratzas exclusive PortaHolder for hands-free grinding into an espresso machine portafilter.
Burrs: The Varios  mm professional ceramic flat burrs produce accurate grinding, high throughput and remain sharp for twice as long as the highest quality steel burrs. The Vario grinds . grams/second at Espresso and . grams/second at Press. The broad range of grind ( microns to  microns) and the narrow particle distribution (lack of fines) are the hallmarks of the superiority of the Vario burrs.
Digital Control Panel: The front mounted control panel with LED display is easy and intuitive. Three programmable buttons allow for grind time setting within . second (about . gram). Simply press the START button and the Vario automatically delivers precise dosing.
Grind Adjustment: The Vario offers macro and micro adjust for fine tuning with ease. The macro adjust moves from espresso to press pot in  distinct and repeatable settings. A secondary micro adjust arm further divides each of the  macro steps into  distinct settings. These steps enable you to dial in the exact grind for the perfect shot.
Grinds Left in Grinder: To maximize freshness, the Vario minimizes the ground coffee left in the grinder.
Brewing Methods: The Vario is exceptional for espresso and manual pour brewing methods.
Motor: A powerful, high torque DC motor effortlessly drives the burrs. This motor turns slowly resulting in cool, quiet operation and permits long grinding duty-cycles. The circuitry is equipped with an automatically resetting, thermal cutoff switch.
Calibration: The Vario is calibrated at the factory to ensure an accurate range of grind. If necessary, the Vario burrs can be easily calibrated using the special calibration tool that comes with the grinder.
Portaholder: The Vario comes with the Portaholder which permits hands-free grinding into an espresso portafilter and makes clean up a snap. The regular  oz. grounds bin is also included.
Cleaning: Burrs are easily removable with no tools, making cleaning very easy.
Hopper extender: An extension that can add  oz. of capacity to the existing  oz. bean hopper. Several extenders can be added to get to the capacity you need.

The Virtuoso lives up to its name by providing technical skill, classic style and a consistent, quality grind.
Grinding for espresso? Let the Virtuosos professional-grade mm conical burrs perform their magic for a consistent, fine grind. How about a French Press? The Virtuoso can handle that too, with a particle size uniformity that gives you consistency from cup to cup. In fact, the Virtuoso is so consistent at both the coarse and fine ends of the grind range that we consider it to be in a class all by itself  and so do many of the micro- and specialty-roasters who swear by it.

The secret to the Virtuosos consistent, smooth grind is two-fold: an efficient DC motor keeps your beans cool, even during extended grind times, while a combination of electric and gear speed reducers slow the burr to  RPM, ensuring a smooth bean feed and reducing noise, heat and static buildup.

The Virtuosos exterior is just as finely tuned as its interior  a convenient front-mounted pulse button allows for grinding directly into an espresso filter basket, while a -second timer means that its easy to replicate the ideal grind time. With the Virtuoso, the look goes beyond merely functional. A sculptured metal top and base give this grinder an expensive, elegant image that adds a sense of class and quality to kitchen counters and coffee shop workspaces alike.

When you want it all, the Virtuoso is the grinder that will get you there with function, elegance, and style.

The Bella is the wool sweater of our blends -- warm, comforting, familiar. Wild and citrusy organic African paired with earthy organic Indonesian makes for a vivid and fairly complex Moka/Java blend. It seems to weather the rigors of the automatic drip machine as well. This is, perhaps, why it's our most popular blend. It is also on the darker side: nice and thick without being inelegant. Bella stands up to milk or cream well, and is easily enjoyed black.

Our blends are carefully chosen from two or three coffees for their harmonious relationship in the cup.

From the foggy climes of the Alta Verapaz comes a pairing of dual magnetism. Taking its influences from the rich volcanic loam of the jungle floor, the chocolate smolders with gunpowder and oolong.

If you drink it strong, store it carefully and use it up quickly (buy a smaller amount and try to use it up in a week), you will be rewarded with very big flavors.The decaf Noir is surprisingly (some say freakishly) versatile: about the only preparation we dont see consistently enjoyable results in is the siphon.

In Ethiopia, birthplace to coffee and home to more indigenous varietals than any other region, the production of exceptional coffee is an issue of national concern. Not only does the government-affiliated commodity exchange oversee grading and selling coffee, but most of the countrys coffee is grown by smallholder farmers. Lucky for us, weve found a peerless, naturally processed coffee from the townships of Gelena and Abaya, considered a part of the famed Yirgacheffe region. Nowadays, when many of the best Yirgacheffes are washed coffees, were pleased to find this naturalan expertly processed, bright cup. Its unapologetic in its strawberryness and will remind you that coffee indeed comes from a fruit.

THE RAREST OF THE RARE

When the elusive Gesha reemerged on the coffee scene in , it caused a furor of high-stakes drama and suspense. A farmer had entered a handful of scrappy-looking beans into the prestigious Best of Panama competition. The flavor of the coffee itself was polarizingwhat was this floral, heavily fruited brew? When traced back to its source, the coffee plants themselves were just as shocking. Like Charlie Brown x-mas trees, they stood stark and twiggy amidst the verdant and prodigious crops of Panama. Out of this dizzying cloud of confusion, the farmer, Price Peterson, of Hacienda La Esmeralda, walked away with the grand prize. 

The highly coveted Gesha was recognized for what it truly was: a delicate improbability; the rarest of the rare. From that moment forward, this celebrated cultivar has shattered expectations, leaving a string of coffee love affairs in its wake. 

Originally from Ethiopia, Geshas are extremely difficult to grow and require a lot of love to achieve even a micro-lot of exquisite cherry. And theyre worth it. Impossible to refuse, and demanding unparalleled attention, they fill us with nervous, lovelorn excitement.

A blend of organic coffee that is quite dark and chocolaty. Maybe a bit more one-dimensional than the Bella Donovan, but it is a good dimension. Giant Steps is delightfully fudgy and thick in a French press or drip pot, and stands up to cream quite well. If it were any heavier-bodied, you could pour it on pancakes.

On a small but earnest plot of land in Huehuetenango, Guatemala, the Herrera family grows coffees of superb delicacy and harmony. Now run by father and son duo Octavio and Otto, who focus their efforts on only the best-producing fields, La Esperanza delivers beautiful coffee cherry. This year, the Herraras reserved a special selection of coffee beans that they considered to be a cut above the rest. And they were right.Our cup had the sweet, floral, and crisp qualities that we have come to associate with Huehuetenango Esperanza, but with a special nod to rose, melon, and fresh herbs. We just met our favorite antihero.

We developed this espresso over five years ago for the launch of our Kiosk on Linden Street. This is probably our darkest espresso: lower-toned, minimal brightness, plenty of chocolate  with an engaging complexity as a straight shot. The shots are gorgeous: achingly heavy with voluptuous red-brown crema, and the silky, somewhat dangerous-looking viscosity of a power-steering stop-leak product once used on our (now departed) heroically battered  Peugeot. In milk, it tastes like chocolate ovaltine, and holds its own from the daintiest oz Macchiato to our towering oz caffe latte. This is the most Brahmsian espresso we have. Brooding and autumnal, it is a coffee to mourn the passing of time.

In the Honduran village of Santa Elena, the Catracha Coffee Company helps farmers with sustainable cultivation and ensures a fair price for each harvest. Producers with limited land prioritize quality over quantity, and it shows in each cup. We are now the exclusive buyer of eight unique farmers in the community and pay an average of fifteen percent higher than ever before, all because of their superb craftsmanship. This particular coffee, Alfonso Vasquezs, is the perfect companion to the lingering wisps of summer and the arrival of fall, with its bright lime settling into the spice of ginger and clove.

The Gatubu factory, part of the Iyego Cooperative, was built in  to serve the farmers in Muranga county on the slopes of the Aberdare Range, Kenya. The French Mission coffee varieties, SL and K, are common in the area, and perform well in the red volcanic soils. After the ripe cherries are picked, the coffee is pulped, fermented, washed by water from the Mathioya river, and graded by hand while it sun dries. The result in the cup is bright and tangy, with grapefruit and plum acidity, and a creamy body.

Whats in a name? Well, weve always been fans of the opascope, a beautiful tool for projecting handwriting and finely rendered artwork onto a larger surface. We could blab for hours about its quaint design, its bulky contours, its place in our childhood classrooms. But for expediencys sake, lets put it this way: The opascope is a tool for taking careful craftsmanship and opening it up for everyone to access and enjoy. Sound familiar? Available only in the Bay Area and online, the three-component Opascope Espresso is a refreshing addition to a lineup once dominated by dense, chocolatey selections. It yields an effervescent shot, packed with stripes of tropicalia.

In , Eric Smeets and his family bought the Elton farm in Mbozi, Tanzania. A large farm, located next to the even-larger Mbozi meteorite, Elton is in the process of transitioning to certified organic cultivation. Young macadamia have been planted amidst coffee plants to provide shade. Organic compost (made from the farms own coffee pulp, parchment, and manure) enriches the soil. This fully washed coffee is dried in the sun for  days. When consumed beneath the midnight sky, particularly after the new moon, the Elton displays its cosmic originswe swear it makes meteors shine.

This coffee is generally a blend of Congolese and two different Ethiopians coffees. Together, these components produce a big, chocolaty aroma and excel in just about every prep method, save espresso and siphon. Unlike some of our fancy-shmancy single origins, this blend has a very easy-to-like personality, good body, unthreatening complexity, and a reasonably clean aftertaste. The coffeestwo Ethiopians, one dry-processed and one wet processed; and a wet-processed Congoleseleave subtle imprints of dried blueberries and cardamom. A fairly dark roast, this inclusive blend will take milk or cream well. Some say damn well.

The Bella is the wool sweater of our blends -- warm, comforting, familiar. Wild and citrusy organic African paired with earthy organic Indonesian makes for a vivid and fairly complex Moka/Java blend. It seems to weather the rigors of the automatic drip machine as well. This is, perhaps, why it's our most popular blend. It is also on the darker side: nice and thick without being inelegant. Bella stands up to milk or cream well, and is easily enjoyed black.

Kochere, Ethiopia Birhanu's farm in the Kabele (Village) of Hama is a far cry from the &frac;-hectare farms normally thought of when people think of farms in Yirgacheffe. It is good to note that, in general, the area of Kochere is a little newer to coffee than the district of Yirgacheffe, and the farms here are a little bit larger. The area of Hama is a little higher than that of the single farmers in Biloya we work with. And areas around his farm are among some the highest in all of Yirgacheffe. The growers in this area—and Birhanu himself—have a good diversity of shade trees, and are all farming organically.





















Nyamagabe, Rwanda
In , Nyamagabe became the district that encompassed much of what used to be called the Gikongogo province. The Remera washing station in this district is one of the highest in the country, sitting right at , meters. Producers in this area mainly grow tea and coffee as a cash crop and are very very tinyowning generally just a few hundred coffee trees.
 
Rwanda as a whole, and the Rwandan coffee scene, is truly something to behold, and there is a reason more times than not coffee professionals turn to Rwanda as the success story of all success stories. As many people reading this know, Rwanda went through one of the worst human atrocities in the genocide that occurred in . Not just after the genocide, but really after decades of civil war and violence, Rwanda started rebuilding in the late s looking towards many industries as the way towards a better future. The tech industry has been a huge area in which Rwanda has invested, but they also turned to agricultural industriesand coffee, in particular. 

The government of Rwanda originally built a few coffee washing stations around the country in mid s, and a handful of other before the s, but, again, because of ongoing conflict and internal challenges, the coffee market didn't take off like other countries in East Africa.

In , though, the PEARL project recognized that there was huge potential in growing coffee in Rwanda, and, within a decade, there are now coffee washing stations all over country. These washing stations were able to take a product that was receiving at or below commodity prices, to a coffee that is often sought after by professionals around the world. In total, prices being paid to some producers has more than doubled.






Nariño, Colombia Nariño is an area of Colombia well known for its quality coffee, but one that has been quite difficult for sourcing coffee. Until recently, the area has been in a great deal of political conflict, and producers had very little access to successful avenues for selling their coffee. The coffee farmers are nestled deep in the mountains that border Ecuador.

	In the past five years, we’ve travelled North, South, East, and West across Colombia, covering as much ground as possible.  At each twist and turn we were met by beautiful mountains and fresh diversity— new soils, new climates, new communities of people, and, as a result, new coffee flavors. From this journey we’ve culled eight truly outstanding coffees to share. Each hails from a different part of Colombia, and is comprised of a handful of varieties, or even a single variety, cultivated on small plots of land by individual producers who harvest, process, and dry the coffee themselves. This is a journey of flavor, a unique representation of terroir shaped by single producing families. Thank you for joining us.

	In the past five years, we’ve travelled North, South, East, and West across Colombia, covering as much ground as possible.  At each twist and turn we were met by beautiful mountains and fresh diversity— new soils, new climates, new communities of people, and, as a result, new coffee flavors. From this journey we’ve culled eight truly outstanding coffees to share. Each hails from a different part of Colombia, and is comprised of a handful of varieties, or even a single variety, cultivated on small plots of land by individual producers who harvest, process, and dry the coffee themselves. This is a journey of flavor, a unique representation of terroir shaped by single producing families. Thank you for joining us.

	The Colombia Tasting Series includes  -  gram tins of coffees from  individual farmers in different micro-regions. Each set includes an interactive booklet, with in-depth farm information, maps and photos.

	Danilo Caro grows coffee in Quindío, a department near the center of Colombia criss-crossed by the Andes, and known for its coffee. Danilo’s farm, El Vergel, is home to a mix of Caturra, Typica, and Colombia coffee varieties, averaging an age of  years — a very mature age for coffee in Colombia. We believe that older trees lend complexity and spice notes in the cup. Danilo’s cultivation of Typica trees is unusual;  years ago the Typica variety comprised over % of Colombia’s coffee. Today, it is nearly lost as producers are encouraged to plant more disease resistant varieties which can display different cup characteristics.

	Danilo is an Olympic skeet shooter, and he brings that level of focus and practice to his farm, where he has improved cup quality through attentive cherry selection, and refinements in his fermentation and drying techniques. That extra work is certainly evident in this year’s crop, which displays vibrant notes of fresh cranberry, lemon, and honey.

	Enrique Lopez is a top-quality coffee producer in league with a top-quality wine producer. He hand-selected the site for his Finca, Chelin, in Oaxaca, Mexico for it’s high elevation --  meters above sea level -- and for the cool temperatures and steady winds off the Pacific Ocean that encourage slow ripening off his coffee fruit. We met Enrique in  while judging at Mexico’s Cup of Excellence and visited his farm in May  where we were thoroughly impressed and intrigued by variations in his processing.

	Finca Chelin was also chosen because Enrique wanted a sustainable, organic, pesticide-free farm. Currently, Fina Chelin holds  Organic certifications, as well as Shade Grown, Bird Friendly and Rainforest Alliance certifications -- providing ample evidence of Enrique’s conscientious farming practices.

	A standout as our first ever Mexican coffee, for Enrique’s dedication to quality, for its unique processing, and for it’s jammy, juicy, and clean cup profile, Finca Chelin is a coffee worth savoring.

	Coffees from Kenya, particularly the Nyeri region where the Gaturiri is from, are truly unlike any other coffees in the world. These coffees are known for their intensity of flavor packed with wild acidity, rich body, juicy sweetness and unrivaled complexity. The flavor starts with the unique SL  and SL  varieties, mutations of the Bourbon variety that are native to Kenya. Both of these varieties were created in the &#

	The city of Antigua, Guatemala is shadowed by several volcanos. The largest named Hunapu by the Mayans. Luis Pedro Zelaya uses the name Hunapu — meaning “mountain of flowers” — to refer to the coffee from producers who cultivate Bourbon, Caturra, and Catuai coffee varieties in the mixed shade and nutrient-rich soil of the volcanoes surrounding Antigua at - meters above sea level.

	Luis is a fourth generation coffee farmer and owner of a Beneficio Bella Vista where nearly  farmers deliver ripe, sorted coffee to undergoes a long, cool, fermentation and a thorough washing and drying. During this process, lots are kept separate and we have the opportunity to cup through and select our favorite small lots to piece together a custom Hunapu coffee for Madcap. 

	Buyers from around the world work with Luis to select coffees delivered to Beneficio Bella Vista. It says a lot that so many roasters around the world seek these coffees, and that the  or so farmers involved with the Hunapu project produce quality consistently high enough to satisfy buyers. A reminder that Hunapu is a quintessential representation of the quality potential in Antigua when great varieties are paired with a nearly ideal climate and precise process, giving the coffee great structure and acidity with a syrupy, juicy sweetness.

	Over the last decades, quality coffee production in Rwanda has advanced substantially. Since being decimated by civil war and strife, coffee has become a major export in Rwanda, where more than three-quarters of its citizens subsist through agriculture. Investment in infrastructure to process coffee and close work with growers has increased production of specialty coffee, work aided by non-profit and government funded programs, some of which was advised by professionals in specialty coffee. Kanzu the Cooperative  has had the support of Technoserve, an organization that was also involved in Mutovu and Yukro. It certainly helps that Rwanda’s terrain is very mountainous, with the high elevations, healthy ecosystems and nutrient rich soil beneficial to quality production.

	The Kanzu name refers both to the cooperative and the washing station. Kanzu rests in a valley betwixt mountain peaks near the shores of Lake Kivu. Founded in  with the aid of Technoserve, Kanzu brings together the coffee from hundreds of farmers who harvest fruit from trees cultivated on the mountains above and deliver ripe cherry for processing. Old-growth bourbon trees and terroir of the Nyamasheke region provide the backbone for this coffee with powerful character and acidity, while a  hour fermentation process adds complexity. After harvest and drying in March-July, this coffee then faces an epically long journey from land-locked Rwanda here to the USA.

	Lush, deeply fruited, and juicy, Kanzu is vivid, clear and clean. This marks our third consecutive season purchasing coffee from the Nyamasheke region. This dynamic coffee represents the potential for high-quality in Rwanda, and elsewhere in Africa where excellent terroir can be at odds with challenges in infrastructure and government which make uncovering coffees like Kanzu difficult. We’re very excited to offer this coffee for Winter and Spring.

	A taste of a Kenyan coffee can be as complex and vibrant as the systems and work that go into creating it.

	Kenyan coffee is grown by individual producers who typically cultivate a small amount of coffee, and who belong to larger groups who are organized around factories where fresh coffee fruit is delivered for processing. The producers who contribute coffee to this factory, Kathakwa,  from the villages of Kibugu and Nguviu, cultivate an average of  trees on about an acre-and-a-half of land. Staff from Kathakwa advise on crop husbandry, the amount and timing of fertilizer application for maximum production, and when to spray for pest and disease prevention. Some farms produce passion fruit, maize, beans and tea for consumption; although producers are not encouraged to intercrop. Credit facilities, in terms of picking advances, farm inputs, school fees, and emergencies, are provided by Kathawka when funds are available.

	Rainfall in Kenya is clustered in two seasons — the main rainy season, March-October, watered this coffee, from October through December. Production at Kathawaka is focused on the lauded SL- & SL- varieties, which are associated with the Bourbon lineage, and also on Riuru- which is a variety developed for disease resistance and hybridized with SL/ varieties to improve cup characteristics. The terroir consists of the deep, rich, red soils of Mt. Kenya, at an elevation exceeding  meters, which ensures consistently cool temperatures ranging from the low ’s to near  degrees F.

	The coffee fruit is hand-picked for ripeness and delivered same-day to the Kathakwa factory for processing where it is pulped, fermented overnight, washed, soaked, and spread on raised beds to dry. Next, the coffee is held in wooden conditioning bins for the moisture content to stabilize before it is physically graded. Water used for coffee processing is very high in N; the waste water at Kathakwa is filtered through soak pits with nappier grass and trees planted nearby.

	After visiting Kenya, we are pleased to offer this big, bright coffee, from a sophisticated collection of people who manage their own aspect in the pursuit of quality coffee. Kathawaka displays notes of fig and plum on the low end, and bight tangerine on the high end.  Cardamom and jam-like flavors create complexity in the cup. This enticing and elegant cup is loaded with qualities to enjoy.

	The Las Serranias is decaffeinated using the Natural Ethyl Acetate Method at the Descafecol plant in Manizales. Ethyl acetate is used as an extractor of the caffeine component of the coffee. Generally, this decaffeination process is performed using added chemicals. The ethyl acetate used in the Las Serranias, however, is obtained using fermented sugar cane (which naturally contains ethyl acetate), complementing the sweetness of the coffee. Rarely will one ever find a decaf coffee as sweet, complex, and enjoyable as the Las Serranias. Las Serranias is the exclusive decaf that is offered at Madcap as we are yet to find an option that comes close to comparing.

	Since , Luis Reinoso’s coffee has been a star in our lineup. That year we began to purchase coffee from Luis and his brother Didier. Luis’ Colombian farm, Finca Vista Hermosa, or, “farm with a beautiful view”, rests at roughly  meters above sea level, looking out on a mix of cultivated coffee and natural forest.

	This high elevation provides the coffee trees with cool temperatures and a lower oxygen environment associated to coffees with fine, bright acidity. Indeed, we find lush fruit flavors of plums, cherries and citrus defining Luis’ coffee as a filter or espresso brew. In cultivation are Caturra and Bourbon varieties, at a roughly - ratio, both of which are associated with lower-yield but high-quality cup characteristics. Having only two varieties is a risky choice &#

	The  Good Food Award Winning Reko is back for its second season!

	Ethiopia is known for luscious coffee — and nowhere more than Yirgacheffe. Kochere, a micro-climate within Yirgacheffe, benefits coffee with an iron-rich red-brown soil, abundant rainfall, elevation from - masl — over a mile above sea level —and shade from trees such as Acacia. Complex flavor, crisp acidity and fruity-sweetness is the result. It’s hard to top heirloom varieties grown in their natural habitat. 

	During harvest, from October through mid-January, farmers deliver red cherries to Reko. Coffee at the Reko washing station is cleaned in a close-by river, pulped on an heritage Agard pulping machine, and fermented for - hours before being dried on raised beds for - days. One might call this processing completely transparent: it imparts nothing to cup, safeguarding the acidity and complexity of these Kochere coffees.

	Having bought from Kochere in years past, we were on lookout for a beautiful Spring coffee to share when this lot from Reko turned our heads. May is early season for Ethiopian coffee, yet, if Reko’s fresh crop is portent, then this Summer stands to be superb for these bright, clean, dynamic, crisp and delicious coffees.

	In honor of our hometown area code here in Grand Rapids, we dubbed this blend Six One Six. Six One Six is enjoyable, trustworthy, and balanced: designed to be a delicious coffee that everyone can savor and trust everyday, much like the city itself. Embracing our commitment to seasonal changes in coffee harvests, the coffees in Six One Six change throughout the year, lending subtle flavor differences that keep this blend interesting. 

	Embracing our dedication to excellent coffees, the Third Coast Espresso blend uses several of our best coffees in the course of the year to produce a luscious espresso: sweet, flavorful, and complex in its pure form, yet robust enough to support milk drinks. Careful observation throughout the year will yield the joy of tasting subtle, seasonal flavor changes. The Third Coast Espresso produces a rich texture, mixed berries, vibrant acidity and a balanced creamy body.

	The well-structured coffees of Planadas are known for syrupy body and intense sweetness. Vicenta’s coffee exemplifies this character, displaying remarkable complexity and sweetness. While we’ve bought from Tolima since , this is our first purchase from Planadas and from Vincenta. The wet, cool climate of this eastern region yields longer cherry maturation, fermentation, and drying.

	This % Caturra coffee was harvested in June , fermented for  hours, and dried over a very long -day period in covered beds which protect the coffee from rain. This processing highlights the thick, juicy, and slightly savory elements of Vincenta’s coffee which displays notes of blackberry, jasmine, mango, and cheesecake.

                                    Ripe cherries are hand picked by local pickers. The pickers are paid extra to sort ripe cherries from the unripe while they are picking. Sorting is done by simply putting the cherries in separate bags.
After de-pulping the mucilage is removed with the use of a penagos aqua pulper. Then the parchment is fermented for  hours before it is washed using african washing techniques which helps sorting floaters and undeveloped beans from the denser and more developed coffee. After washing, the beans are soaked for about  hours in running clean water. Then the coffee gets dried slowly on raised beds covered with shade nets.                                
We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our light roasted coffees are suited for all brew methods except espresso. The roast level gives a cup with clarity, brightness and sweetness with little  bitterness and ashy flavors from the roast process.

If brewed as espresso on an espresso machine, the lighter roast style will result in a cup with a very high level of acidity due to the highly concentrated brew. We therefore recommend using our slightly darker roasted coffees for making espresso.
All our coffees are packed in vacuum sealed, recyclable plastic bags that are flushed with nitrogen before seal- ing. The bags has a one way valve to let the coffee de-gas while quality is kept in the sealed bag.

When the coffee is roasted it develops a lot of CO gas inside the beans. This gas will make the coffee taste smokey and ashy immediately after roasting. It is abso- lutely crucial to let the coffee degas and rest for a while before use to ensure maximum flavour.

We recommend storing / degassing our ligher roasted coffees for minimum  to  days after the date of roast , sealed in the original bag at room temperature, before you use it.

Make sure you store it in a dark place at around C - C, away from any heat, moisture or light. The coffee has lost most of its sweetness and aroma - weeks after the day of roast, so make sure you use it before it is too late.

You can find the roast date and batch number on all our coffees in the bottom right corner of the front label on the bags. 
We strongly recommend to use correct measurments and brewing techniques when you brew our coffees. Use a digital scale both to measure water and coffee in order to get consistent results.

We recommend to use between  to  grams of coffee per litre (g) of water, depending on the brewing method, water quality and coffee used.

                                    Ripe cherries are hand picked by local pickers. The pickers are paid extra to sort ripe cherries from the unripe while they are picking. Sorting is done by simply putting the cherries in separate bags.
After de-pulping the mucilage is removed with the use of a penagos aqua pulper. Then the parchment is fermented for  hours before it is washed using african washing techniques which helps sorting floaters and undeveloped beans from the denser and more developed coffee. After washing, the beans are soaked for about  hours in running clean water. Then the coffee gets dried slowly on raised beds covered with shade nets.

Our espresso roasts are similar to our light roasts but are developed slightly more in order to reduce the intensity of acidity when brewed as espresso. This roast will give you slightly more bitter notes when brewed as a filter coffee. 
We strongly recommend to use the VST filterbaskets for making espresso. The VST filters make it a lot easier to extract the espresso properly which gives a lot more sweetness in the cup. They are also more or less identical to each other which makes it easy to be more consistent when brewing on several groups at the same time.

Here is our typical brewing recipe when we use the VST  gram filterbasket:
	C  C brew water temperature
	 -  bars of pressure
	   grams of freshly ground coffee (use scales to measure)
	   grams of  liquid espresso in the cup (use scales to measure
	   seconds brewing time (use scales to measure)

                                    Cherries are hand picked by the smallholder farmers that are members of the cooperative. After harvest the coffee cherries are hand sorted to get rid of underripe and overripe cherries before the cherries are delivered for processing. A Penagos Eco Pulper is used to remove the skin, pulp and mucilage from the parchment coffee. Afterwards the parchment is soaked in clean water for about  hours. The parchment coffee gets skin dried and sorted under shade for about  hours after soaking before it is dried in the sun for about  days on African drying beds.                                
Nano Chala is a relatively new cooperative, established in . They are located in an Agaro, an area that is starting to get known for intense and clean coffees with unique flavours. Most of the coffees are grown above  meters above sea leve at smallholder farms averaging at about , hectares in size. The farmers grow a lot of different traditional cultivars in addition to  an improved native cultivar called "." Most of the coffees in Ethiopia and in this area are produced organically by tradition, but the farmers and cooperative is not certified for organic production and sales.  
The Nano Challa cooperative was formed with assistance from Technoserve. A non profit organization founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. Technoserve has been assisting with training of the management, organizing the cooperative and also finding markets for it's coffees. Technoserve’s coffee initiative is a project measuring their success in the value and quality of the coffees produced and the farmers income increase. All cooperative members are qualified for a second payment, which means they get paid a small fee when they deliver their coffee cherries to the cooperative and get the differential paid once the coffee is sold and the sales price is fixed. This has so far contributed to a significant increase in payment for the local coffee farmers.

 We have been part of developing the Oslo cup series from Figgjo together with designer Kristin Hærnes Ihlen from Physical Design and Figgjo. Therte are three different cups in the series. All made to enhance the drinking experience:
"Tulipan" (Tulip) is designed for coffees with lower acidity like typical Bourbons from El Salvador, Brazil or Indian coffees. The cone shaped cup enhances more earthy aromas and gives you an impression that the coffee is very sweet as the liquid enters the mouth in a narrow stream and hits the middle of the tongue.
"Splitt" is designed for coffees with intense fruity and floral aromas and bright acidity. Typically we use these cups for our Kenyan and Ethiopian coffees. The unique design enhances the aromatics when you smell the coffee in the cup and the wide shape makes the liquid enter your mouth with a wider spread so that you percieve acidity more clearly.
 "Åpen" (open) is more of an allround cup. The classic U-shape is a forgiving shape when it comes to taste balance yet it has the ability to intensify aromas when you smell the coffees. We typically use these cups for coffees that has fruity characters and medium intense acidity. 
The fun part is that you can play around with the different shapes with different coffees and change your guests perception of how the coffees taste like.

                                    The coffee is selectively hand picked by hired pickers under
supervision of Elias. Cherries are hand sorted before they are
processed to make sure only ripe cherries are processed together.
After depulping the parchment coffee is rinsed in clean water.
Then the water is drained and the parchment is fermented for
 to  hours. After fermentation the coffee is washed in clean
water that is changed  times. All oaters are removed during
the washing. The Parchment is soaked for  hours in clean
water before it is dried in parabolic dryers under shade from  -  days.                                
We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our light roasted coffees are suited for all brew methods except espresso. The roast level gives a cup with clarity, brightness and sweetness with little  bitterness and ashy flavors from the roast process.

If brewed as espresso on an espresso machine, the lighter roast style will result in a cup with a very high level of acidity due to the highly concentrated brew. We therefore recommend using our slightly darker roasted coffees for making espresso.
All our coffees are packed in vacuum sealed, recyclable plastic bags that are flushed with nitrogen before sealing. The bags has a one way valve to let the coffee de-gas while quality is kept in the sealed bag.

When the coffee is roasted it develops a lot of CO gas inside the beans. This gas will make the coffee taste smokey and ashy immediately after roasting. It is absolutely crucial to let the coffee degas and rest for a while before use to ensure maximum flavour.

We recommend storing / degassing our ligher roasted coffees for minimum  to  days after the date of roast , sealed in the original bag at room temperature, before you use it.

Make sure you store it in a dark place at around C - C, away from any heat, moisture or light. The coffee has lost most of its sweetness and aroma - weeks after the day of roast, so make sure you use it before it is too late.

You can find the roast date and batch number on all our coffees in the bottom right corner of the front label on the bags. 
We strongly recommend to use correct measurments and brewing techniques when you brew our coffees. Use a digital scale both to measure water and coffee in order to get consistent results.

We recommend to use between  to  grams of coffee per litre (g) of water, depending on the brewing method, water quality and coffee used.

                                    Cherries are hand picked by the smallholder farmers that are members of the cooperative. After harvest the coffee cherries are hand sorted to get rid of underripe and overripe cherries before the cherries are delivered for processing. A Penagos Eco Pulper is used to remove the skin, pulp and mucilage from the parchment coffee. Afterwards the parchment is soaked in clean water for about  hours. The parchment coffee gets skin dried and sorted under shade for about  hours after soaking before it is dried in the sun for about  days on African drying beds.                                
Nano Chala is a relatively new cooperative, established in . They are located in an Agaro, an area that is starting to get known for intense and clean coffees with unique flavours. Most of the coffees are grown above  meters above sea leve at smallholder farms averaging at about , hectares in size. The farmers grow a lot of different traditional cultivars in addition to  an improved native cultivar called "." Most of the coffees in Ethiopia and in this area are produced organically by tradition, but the farmers and cooperative is not certified for organic production and sales.  
The Nano Challa cooperative was formed with assistance from Technoserve. A non profit organization founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. Technoserve has been assisting with training of the management, organizing the cooperative and also finding markets for it's coffees. Technoserve’s coffee initiative is a project measuring their success in the value and quality of the coffees produced and the farmers income increase. All cooperative members are qualified for a second payment, which means they get paid a small fee when they deliver their coffee cherries to the cooperative and get the differential paid once the coffee is sold and the sales price is fixed. This has so far contributed to a significant increase in payment for the local coffee farmers.

We believe so strongly in the power of super-fresh coffee that we only deliver to you weekly what you will drink in  to  days. If we sent you enough coffee for two weeks--or even worse an entire month--it would begin to lose it's vibrancy before you could finish half of it.

Invented by engineer Alan Adler, of Aerobie Frisbee fame, the AeroPress has, fittingly, inspired crazy ingenuity in variety of brew methods. The portable and lightweight AeroPress brews a sweet, full-bodied cup wherever you are: at home, camping or on a road trip. This particular method is best when youre out in the field or if you dont have a scale.
Measure and grind g of coffee  one rounded AeroPress spoonful or about   Tablespoons. Grind the coffee about as fine as table salt.

Get the AeroPress ready to brew by placing the filter in the basket. Next, preheat the brewer and rinse the filter with hot water. This gets rid of any paper flavor and warms everything up. Heat up your mug with hot water while youre at it.

Discard the rinse water from your mug. Affix the basket to the bottom of the brew chamber and place it on top of the mug. If its handy, use the funnel (or coffee loader) that comes with the AeroPress to add g of coffee. Then, remove the funnel. 

Start your timer when you pour hot water (just off the boil or about F) into your brewer. Saturate all the grounds within  seconds. Pour to the No.  or g of water if youre using a scale. Spin the chamber, making sure all the coffee is saturated. 

Once you hit the No. , stir the slurry (coffee and water mixture) and place the plunger on the brew chamber and pull up slightly to create a pressure seal. Dont plunge yet! 

At :, remove the pressure seal and give the slurry another stir with a spoon or paddle. 
Put the plunger back on and gently press down with steady pressure, stopping as soon as you hear a hissing sound. This entire brew process should take just under two minutes and yield seven to eight ounces of coffee. 

The AeroPress is easy to clean. Simply take off the basket and pop out the coffee grounds and filter. Clean the rubber plunger with hot kettle water and youre ready for your next brew.

A sleek and simple daily pour over, the Bee House is a favorite around here for its ease of use, and clean, sweet cup character. Its a Japanese update on a classic paper cone brewer. Melitta Bentz invented the first version of this brewer in , using her sons blotting paper and a punctured brass pot. Today, you can find Melitta filters just about everywhere.
Measure g or (about  Tablespoons) of coffee beans. Grind them to medium fine or about as fine as table salt. 

Fold a Melitta # filter down the scalloped edges. Insert it into the Bee House Brewer and place it on top of your mug or pitcher. Pre-rinse the filter with hot water to rinse out the paper flavor and preheat your brewer and mug. Make sure to chuck this rinse water before you begin brewing. Add the ground coffee to the filter and zero out the scale.

Start the timer once you add hot water. Saturate the grounds, then give them a stir to break up the clumps. Coffee degasses or  blooms when its fresh  the coffee bed should rise up  and bubble up a bit. 

Pour the water evenly in a spiral over the coffee bed and slowly fill the brewer to the top. Pour over the dark spots and avoid the light ones as you bring the weight up to about g by :.

Once you hit :, your mug should be almost full (or you should have about  oz of brewed coffee). If there is still water in left in the brewer at this time, dont sweat it. Remove the dripper from atop the mug and place it in the sink. 

An iconic brewer with a timeless design invented in , the Chemex is easy to use and easy on the eyes. The Chemex is housed in the MOMA permanent design collection it also lives on most of our kitchen counters, too. It  brews a clean cup and maintains body and balanced floral notes.
Place the Chemex Filter in the brewer with single fold away from the spout and multiple folds lined up against the spout. Rinse the filter with hot water to get a nice even seal all the way around. This preheats the brewer and gets rid of any paper flavor from the filter. Dump the rinse water and fold the filter toward the spout to reinforce this area.
Add g or about  Tablespoons of coffee ground kind of like Kosher salt. Center the coffee in your brewer and zero out the scale.
Start the timer when you add the hot water. Pour until all the grounds are saturated or until you reach about g. Stir with a chopstick or spoon to make sure there are no dry clumps.
At :, start the second pour, making sure to reintegrate the coffee and water. Pour with a wiggling motion, then a gentle spiral until the volume reaches about a fingertip down from the top of the rim or g of water. Pour over the dark spots and avoid the light ones.
At :, fill the brewer flush to the top or about g of water.
At :, you should be pretty close to volume. Look at the glass bubble or belly button, which indicates  ounces. Lift the filter. Its okay to hover for a couple of seconds to make sure you have enough volume. Then pull the filter out completely and let it drain into the sink.
Swirl the Chemex around a little and youre ready to serve two cups of brewed coffee. 
Theres nothing better than cold brewed coffee on a hot summer day  or if youre like us, any day, really. Cold Brew coffee is naturally smooth and sweet and less acidic than coffee brewed with hot water. The Filtron Cold Water Brewer is a simple way to make several cups  of cold brew concentrate. Cold brewing takes between    hours (we recommend ) but the payoff is huge. This batch should keep you buzzing for days. We recommend a ratio of : coffee concentrate to water over ice, adjusting to taste.
Take the rubber stopper and plug the hole at the bottom of the coffee bowl.
Take the Filtron pad and fit it snugly in the bottom of the coffee bowl. It should be domed up in the center when its in place correctly.  If you are using it for the first time, give it a good rinse. When not using the pad, be sure to store it in cold water in the fridge.
Measure  ounces or  lb of coffee. Your coffee should be ground coarsely to  about the consistency of breadcrumbs. Pour it directly into the coffee bowl and  give it a shake to even out the coffee bed.
Place the coffee guard right on top of the coffee grounds. This will help the water distribute evenly and keep the coffee bed flat during brewing.
Add  ounces of cold water for  ounces ( lb) of coffee. Fill to the the  lb line inside the Filtron water bowl. If youre filling it over the sink, cover the hole at the bottom with your finger so the water doesnt drain out. Or, just add water directly to the water bowl.
After you pour the water in, let it brew for  to  hours. We recommend . Store it in your refrigerator.
After  hours, the concentrate should be ready. Use the handle of the coffee bowl and lift it above the empty  / liter decanter. Pull out the stopper slowly over the decanter and set it on top to drain. This should take about  to  minutes and will make several cups of concentrate.
Pour over ice. We suggest a ratio thats one part concentrate to two parts water. Adjust to your taste. The concentrate will keep in your refrigerator for about  days. Beware! Cold Brew coffee goes down smooth and easy, but packs a potent punch. Sip slowly, or add lots of ice, water, or milk to keep you from flying too close to the sun.
With its stainless steel and wavy contours, the Kalita Wave wins over coffee and design enthusiasts alike. Its a favorite pour over brew method for home use and its great on the go, too. The flat-bottom filter helps with even extraction while brewing.  The key to mastering this brewer is the slow spiral pour. 
Place and rinse the Kalita Wave filter in the dripper. This removes the paper flavor from the filter and warms everything up. Heat up your mug while youre at it.  

Discard the rinse water from the carafe or mug and grind g (about  Tablespoons) of coffee as fine as table salt. Add it to the filter, making sure the bed is completely flat. Place the Kalita Wave on top of a carafe or mug. Tare your scale to zero.

Saturate the dry grounds completely with g of hot water right off the boil (about F) in the first  seconds and allow it to bloom. Coffee degasses or blooms when its freshthe coffee bed should rise up and bubble a bit. Give the coffee a stir with a spoon. 

At :, pour water up to g in a spiral motion by :. The spiral motion helps give you an even extraction and keeps everything integrated.

Pour small amounts (-g of water) periodically to hit g by :. Submerging dark spots and avoiding light spots, slowly bring the water level to the top for an even extraction. 

Your brew volume should reach approximately ml or about to the top of a oz mug  at : to :. Remove the Wave from the carafe or mug and set it in the sink for the rest of the water to drain through. 

We start with the highest quality coffee, cold brew it without heat for over  hours, then use a double filtration process to procure the end result: a complex, smooth and full-bodied brew with low-acid and a chocolate finish. Feelings of invincibility and euphoria are likely to follow.
Say hello to the seasons best greeting. Weve spiced up our sweet and creamy Cold Brew Coffee with Milk adding warm notes of cinnamon, allspice and cloves. Its like a swim in a snow globe. Good tidings to you wherever you are.

We work hard. We make lots of jokes. We cheers beers, ride bikes together, go to shows and trade dogsitting favors. We have tremendous amounts of respect for each other and for what we do. Stumptown is a family on an elemental level. Many of us are artists, musicians, creative types, and passionate types. It helps our coffee taste better and it makes our work lives richer.
And we drink the best office coffee on the planet.  
Some of us came because we were regulars. The baristas knew our drinks and were having a whole helluva lot more fun than the jobs we had. Some came because of the coffee. Some of us were home roasters, or worked for other coffee companies across the country. Came for a chance to work with the best green coffee in the world.
Some came because our best friends worked here. Most became best friends with our coworkers, because they also happened to be some of the best, most interesting people around.
We all came because we wanted to be here. A grip of us have been here for over a decade. Weve outgrown our first employee holiday dinners, squeezed in the backroom of a cozy Italian family restaurant in Southeast Portland. Weve leapt across the country. Went Dutch for a summer. But our holiday parties still rage.
We are passionate group of folks, some might even say obsessive. No matter which team were on, were sourcing, roasting, tasting, testing, practicing and pushing ourselves to do it better.

          We know we are the last link of a long chain, stretching across the earth, made up of hundreds of people and years of toil, soil and sweat to get this coffee into our hands. We take that responsibility very seriously. And we also have a lot of fun.

        Coffee is about pleasure. It’s that moment when your hand is warmed by the mug, you bring it up to your nose, inhale deeply and then take a sip.
      

        That sip is the culmination of years of work, three-thousand mile journeys, and passion. Here is how we make that sip perfect.
      

        While you are holding that cup of coffee, close your eyes. Open your mouth slightly. Breathe in deeply through your nose.
      

        You are smelling the most complex thing humans consume. When people talk about the flavors of coffee — notes of orange, or hints of clove — it’s because those organic molecules are contained in the coffee bean. If a coffee reminds you of apple pie, it's because coffee shares some of the same components as food, like lactic and malic acid.
      

        Inside that small bean are the same natural components that make flowers smell so lovely, the same ethers that let you know when a piece of fruit is ripe. Coffee has twice as much going on, molecularly speaking, as red wine.
      

        When tasting coffee, try waiting for it to cool down a little — you’ll be able to taste (and smell) the most when it’s the same temperature as your body.
      

        Flavor only matters in the context of you. What do you like? What does this scent remind you of? Are you looking for a full-bodied cowboy co
        ffee, or a delicate, tea-like finish? Chocolate aromas, or hints of jasmine?

        Dont worry if you cant describe it precisely, or have a different perception than someone else. Even when you cant put it into words, youll know what you like.
      

        You experience the full flavors of the coffee bean if and only if nothing has gone wrong during
      

        Someone stands by that roaster, all day, a person who knows exactly how to bring the best out of every bean — that ideal ratio of sweetness to acidity, that balance — because he or she has been doing this for years.
      

        Again and again, they repeat the same motion: pull a tiny sample of the beans. Stare at them, looking for the tiny signs of perfection. Smell them deeply. Put them back. Pull out some more beans. Stare. Smell. Five seconds later, repeat the process in a meditation that last hours. Do that hundreds of times a day. Do that every day for years.
      

        Know every bean on a personal level. Adjust times and temperatures throughout the day, knowing that  seconds could make the difference between letting this bean shine and overwhelming it. Know that in the morning, the roaster is cold. Know that in the evening its hot, and you should probably shave  seconds off that roast.
      

        Roast just enough to bring out the best and full potential of what’s inherent in each particular coffee already. Roast to draw out things like acidity, floral notes, chocolate, molasses, and earth. All of the coffee’s flavor potentials are presented at the first crack – an audible signal that happens at a particular point when roasting coffee. After that, roast just enough to add the right amount of body and sweetness, without degradation.
      

        Roasting different coffees as though theyre the same? Not going to work. Roasting for color, not taste? Never this.
      

        Please dont burn those beans. Theyve been through so much. Theyve come all the way across the world.
      

        The best coffee grows in the most remote places. There is a thin band that goes around the world near the equator. Within that band, you need mountains, thick old-growth forest and just the right microclimate. Set aside up to four days to get there.
      

        On your way there, you’ll pass through Houston’s H.W. Bush Intercontinental Airport, or you’ll stand in the endless security line at New York’s JFK en route to distant parts of Ethiopia, Colombia, Indonesia and  other countries around the world.
      

        You’ll also experience  vaccines (the malaria pills—which can cause hallucinations and nightmares—are the worst), a passport that fills up with handwritten visas, bumpy eight-hour van rides, granola bars and in at least one case, eating the heart of a bull that has been slaughtered in your honor.
      

        The Green Team members, named for the color of coffee beans before they are roasted, don’t do it the easy way, which would be buying bulk, mid-quality beans at a trading floor in a capital city. Instead, they go right to the source of the best coffee — that farm or washing station high atop a distant Ethiopian hill. It ends when they arrive at that distant farm, washing station, factory or mill. They sit down in a home or around a campfire to talk about this year’s crop with a producer they have met many times. They get to work.
      

          In Colombia, if you go to four farms you will get four bowls of sanchocho, which is this soup with chicken, yucca, plantains, potatoes, corn, avocado. Basically, its as many calories as you can cram in a bowl.
        

        The Green Team visits every producer as often as possible, sometimes up to three times per year. They constantly roast and taste the coffee, and they form long-term, lasting partnerships with the producers. They’ll help them implement a new farming technique that could lead to even better coffee. Or they’ll teach a seminar on a new way to process coffee cherry, which is the fruit of the coffee tree surrounding the seed or bean.
      

        They routinely pay producers up to four times what they could get for their crop on the commodity market, but in return, they ask for a lot more work—hand picking each cherry at ideal ripeness, or implementing a new piece of equipment.
      

        The Green Team also identifies potential future producers—maybe this side of the mountain has just the right climate, but the quality level isn’t there yet. Stumptown will invest in that farm, or mill, or factory if that producer is willing put forth effort to get the beans to the level the Green Team looks for. It’s a partnership, and there is prestige and pride involved. For a producer, selling to Stumptown means something.
      

        Above all, they want to help farms become sustainable and to set up strong businesses that build up their communities and produce the highest-quality coffee possible year after year.
      

          Our partners are much more than farmers, they are coffee production experts, constantly innovating practices in planting, harvesting and processing the best coffees around.
        

        We don’t buy in bulk on a trading floor. We buy directly from the people who are making the coffee. It’s not a transaction; it’s a partnership. If someone is growing the quality of coffee we’re interested in, then we will help them in any way we can. That means regular visits (even though that trip can take up to four days), implementing new techniques and equipment, and forming long-term partnerships.
      

        We shoot for sustainability, and not just in the environmental sense. A sustainable coffee producer is someone who is paid fairly for their incredible work and who can in turn encourage others to follow in their footsteps. A sustainable producer innovates, develops and improves cultivation and in turn can fetch even higher prices from Stumptown. The more each side of the partnership puts in, the better the coffee gets.
      

        We dont call them farmers, we call them producers, which gives credit to the fact that they are production experts. They are the ones who make this coffee great. They are the ones who are like-minded, who will go the extra mile for quality, whatever that means.

          Producers are the heart of what makes great coffee.
        

          Their skills, expertise and craftsmanship is the difference between mediocre coffee and coffee that is like nothing you’ve ever tasted before. The coffee will never get any better in quality once it lands in our hands, after all. We rely on the producers for that pristine bean. A good roaster works tirelessly to preserve that coffee’s inherent greatness.
        

          The producers grow the coffee trees. They pick the cherry when it is perfectly ripe. They remove the outer fruit, leaving just the bean covered in a thin parchment. They rest the beans, let the beans develop into their full selves.
        

          (This is a ridiculous oversimplification of a meticulous, finicky process. For more on how coffee processing — the transition from tree to bean — works)
        

          Everyone on this page does something slightly different — he may tend a small patch of coffee trees on the farm he inherited from his grandmother; she may oversee the cherry soaking in a big tank of water, fermenting at just the right rate.
        

          They live on four continents. They speak at least  different languages. Some use traditional methods that are centuries old; some have taken out four-year loans to get that new top-of-the-line piece of equipment that will lead to a greater, cleaner cup.
        

          It’s not the easy way. It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way, and it creates the best coffee possible.
        

        Coffee is a tree, and you probably prefer one branch to another, even if you don't know it yet.
      

        There isnt one kind of coffee, theres a coffee family tree. For hundreds of years, humans have been cultivating, hybridizing and perfecting it, and today there are hundreds of types, or varieties.
      

        The variety of coffee tree matters—or at least, it usually does. Just as different types of grapes yield different wines, the variety of th
        e bean can have a profound impact on the finished cup. &#

This father and son team grows, processes and educates at the best coffee-
growing operation in Guatemala and one of the top five in the world.
The Aguirres have opened their own roastery and coffee bar in Guatemala City to 
 showcase their coffee and train baristas.
The Aguirres set the bar in the world of coffee.
We could talk for hours about what theyve done for their community  building 
schools, clinics, safe worker housing, a tortilla factory to make sure everyone is fed, a 
microhydropower plant that powers not only the farm but the nearby village.
Year after year, we come to them for their impeccably balanced, complex coffee that 
hits on every level.
El Injerto is a seven-hour drive from Guatemala City, a bumpy, curvy van ride up over the mountains and down into a lush canyon. From the farm, you can see the Sierra Madre de Chiapas mountain range in Mexico.
From the seasonal pickers all the way up to Arturo Sr., everyone at El Injerto is focused on obsessively making the best coffee possible. 
Every day, they cup with their entire processing team, many of whom used to be pickers and have worked their way up through the organization. Theyll have mini-competitions with blind taste tests so see whos making the best coffee.
They also educate nearby farmers and the coffee world as a whole on sustainability, community engagement and the sense of what great coffee can be. Year after year, El Injerto wins Guatemalas Cup of Excellence award.
The relationship between Stumptown and Finca El Injerto is one of our strongest and longest. Arturo Aguirre, a rd generation coffee farmer, owns and operates the farm with his son, Arturo Jr. They run the farm with dedication to sustaining a coffee farming community and a meticulous approach to processing the highest quality coffee in Guatemala. The efforts of the Aguirre family, combined with our own, have improved the coffee year after year.
Mr. Jesus Aguirre Panama acquired the land in  and planted corn, beans, tobacco, and sugarcane. Around , he planted coffee and named the farm El Injerto after a native fruit that is similar to Zapote fruit and found only in this region. Three generations and over  years later, El Injerto has  hectares planted with coffee: % Bourbon, with the remaining mixed between Catuai, Maragogype, Pacamara, Tekisic, Mocca and Gesha varieties.
Arturo Jr. is working on some new projects which will greatly improve fermentation including building an additional fermentation tank, finishing tiling the entire washing area and tiling all of the tanks. Arturo Jr. conveys a huge sense of pride about their social programs. The family built new housing for their year round workers with the funds from their auction. Eight of the ten families received new homes. They built a new clinic, maintenance room and four newly installed showers and bathrooms for workers. The clinic has been a mainstay at El Injerto for years with a physician who visits every  days from the nearby town of La Democracia. They built a playground and nursery for the pickers kids, which will enable the pickers to have their children supervised and provide activities during harvest. Injerto also pays twice the hourly wage as their neighbors. An expectation of higher scrutiny in all things concerned with harvesting and processing comes with the higher wage. Some workers have found it too demanding, but this is what sets Injerto apart.
Since , Finca El Injerto has produced exceptional coffee with a commitment to respecting and preserving the natural resources of the Huehuetenango region. More than half of Finca El Injerto is a thousand year old virgin forest that surrounds and protects the coffee plantation, preserving the delicate micro-climate required to grow exquisite Arabica coffee.
The Aguirres protect the quality of the land through sustainable agricultural methods. They use coffee parchment for fuel in the mechanical dryers. Water used in wet milling is filtered in ponds before returning to the rivers to avoid pollution downstream. Native species are replanted in reforestation efforts. They focus on the coffee plants tissue management system without the use of fungicides, herbicides or insecticides. They manage weeds strictly by machete. In order to assess the appropriate nutritional supplements for the plants, soil and leaf analysis takes place annually.  Worm culture technology breaks down the coffee cherry skin to produce lombricompost which becomes a fertilizer at the nursery and the final plantings. Shade trees are planted throughout the farm to promote air circulation and control the amount of sunlight received by the plants. El Injerto also has many social projects which promote the well-being and health of the workers and their families.
Arturo Sr. and Jr. ensure perfect cherry selection and utilize cherry flotation to sort by density. Disc depulpers remove the cherry prior to extended fermentation which can last up to  hours due to the cold typical of this altitude.  In , they installed a pre-pulp separator to further minimize pulp contamination during fermentation. The coffee is then double washed and soaked. Patio pre-drying prepares the beans for a final low temperature drum drying. In order to better understand the coffee and all the nuances within their production, they have a cupping lab at the farm with four trained cuppers.
The Aguirres named the section of their farm where they cultivate Pacamara Pandoras Block. This block nourishes a sweet, balanced and floral variety. Pacamara, a hybrid of Pacas and Maragogype, creates a perfect marriage of Bourbon and Typica. Arturo Aguirre Sr. purchased their first Pacamara seeds from El Salvador where the variety originated. Pandoras Block consists of a mixture of old and new plants, averaging  years old. They renovate annually to maintain plant age diversity.
Three years ago, a hail storm swept through Huehuetenango and devastated half of the Aguirres Pacamara plants. The plants can take years to recover. Happily, this year, their production finally reached full volume.
After meticulously picking ripe cherry, they depulp it, dry ferment for - hours, and soak it for  hours in clean water. They dry this lot strictly on tiered raised beds.
Stumptown founder Duane Sorenson brought Gesha seeds to Arturo Aguirre Jr. years ago. Later in the same year, Arturo Sr. traveled to Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama and brought some more seeds directly from the Petersons. 
The Gesha seeds were planted in  in a region of the farm with a high shade canopy called La Calaca. La Calaca translates as the skull. According to the people of the village, this area in the northwest part of the farm used to be where witches of the towns held rituals. They have even found animal skulls to offer as proof of their story. Seven different varieties are cultivated on the  hectare area of La Calaca. Workers on the farm believe they have transformed the rituals of those long ago witches into a good spell. They believe the coffee cultivated here will bewitch any who dares to drink it.
The staff at El Injerto is learning about the nuances of Gesha by constantly checking the crop throughout the growing season to see how it behaves and reacts within the microclimate in order to make important decisions about the tissue management. Each variety reacts differently from climate to climate, so it takes education, observation, and detailed management in order to perfect a particular variety.
The tiny lot of Gesha was treated with utmost care and detail. The Aguirres sent their finest pickers to select these cherry at the height of the harvest season. After depulping, this lot was dry fermented for - hours in perfectly clean conditions, moving the beans after each stage for uniform fermentation. The lot was then washed and soaked for  hours then dried on tiered, raised drying beds. They sorted this lot by hand twice, once during the parchment stage and then again just prior to export at the green bean stage. 
In , the Aguirres built a micro hydroelectric power plant which provides electricity for the farm, mill and all of the housing (which includes workers housing). They purchased and distributed over  safer and more efficient gas cooking stoves to replace the less healthy wood stoves in their workers homes. They also continue to provide free food for all of their workers from their onsite tortilla factory. The Aguirre family plans to plant more Gesha. This year the Gesha dried on raised beds for the first time, rather than on patios.
The co-op supports its  members through education and sustainability initiatives in a very remote area near the Andes Mountain in Northern Peru. 
Recently the cooperative made a big investment in a large compost plant called a Pachakushi, which is used to create organic compost that is distributed among co-op members.
La Prosperidad de Chirinos Cooperative supports its  members through education and sustainability initiatives, maintains model and learning gardens, a coffee nursery, and a guinea pig farm (a food staple here) as part of a food security program. Were really excited about the growth weve seen so far and looking very forward to a bright future for a long term partnership. 
Chirinos is located in a very remote and beautiful area in the Cajamarca Region in Northern Peru with breathtaking landscapes. When we travel here to meet our producer partners, travel is slow and bumpy. The coffee culture here is relatively young and the region is only just beginning to gain access to basic infrastructure, such as electricity and paved roads. Our last trip traveling through this region, we spent over  hours in the car. 
When come for a visit, our producers always offer upon arrival a shot of homemade aguardiente, anise-flavored firewater booze that the locals (and many producers we know) make and store in plastic Coca-Cola liters. For dinner, were served freshwater fish, wild hen, or cuy (guinea pig) and rice and yucca, served with Aji sauce.   
A cultural heritage and ethos of environmental awareness is embedded in the culture here, creating a mecca for organic coffee. Addressing the difficult issue of organic fertilization, Chirinos recently invested in a large compost plant and can now produce nutrient-rich organic compost that is distributed among members. Each producer primarily cultivates coffee on their small farms and brings it to Chirinos for processing. They depulp their coffee into wood or concrete tanks for fermentation and dry it on patios. 
Among those who love Antiguan coffees, the Zelaya family is legendary. Luis represents the fourth generation of this tremendous legacy, and while he honors tradition, he also pushes Antiguan coffee toward the future. He constantly innovates and elevates quality levels, and is instrumental in making Antiguan Coffee a Protected Designation of Origin product, which places them alongside Champagne from the th parallel or prosciutto from southern Italy. Whenever he visits us in Portland, he always wants to stop by the Horse Brass Pub for a local microbrew.
Founded in , Antigua is a regal place, having once been the capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala. It sits in the shadow of three volcanoes  including the very active Fuego Volcano. The last time we visited, Fuego was spewing plumes of ash and the lava was flowing  its that same volcanic ash that contributes to the incredible minerality of the soil, and in turn, the beautiful fruitiness of the coffee.
Luis is unique among our larger producers  he has taken coffee separation and made it a wonderfully meticulous art. He divides his coffee by farm, microclimate, location, date harvested and more  and keeps all of it separate through depulping, processing and drying. The result is an incredible variety of nuanced, distinct coffees with bright, sweet flavor.
Antigua, Guatemala is one of the most renowned coffee producing regions in the world due to its climate, altitude, fertile volcanic soils and farming practices. Antigua sits in a valley scattered with coffee farms surrounded by three volcanoes: Agua, Fuego and Acatenango.
Bella Vista is a farm, wet mill, and dry mill owned by the Zelaya family. With over  years of experience, the Zelaya family is committed to maintaining excellent quality coffee through ecologically stable and environmentally friendly methods.
Our Bella Vista consists of coffee from a combination of % Bourbon lots processed at Bella Vista, some grown by Zelaya himself and some grown by the Hunapu group.
Zelaya also instigated variety separation at Bella Vista farm, which fostered the ability for a lot consisting only of Villa Sarchi, a variety renown for sweetness and brightness. They improved their raised bed infrastructure by converting to three-tiered parabolic drying beds.
Hunapu, the local indigenous Cackchiquel word for the Volcano de Agua, is the name of a group of smallholder producers in the San Miguel Dueas and Ciudad Vieja microregions around Antigua who process their coffee at Bella Vista. Since , Luis Pedro has worked with these farmers to develop meticulous lot separation with the ability to track lots from the farms, to the mill, to the warehouse and to their final destination. He brings his familys commitment to each family he works with for all the coffees milled at Bella Vista.
The Hunapu farmers deliver their red ripe coffee cherry to the Zelaya familys Bella Vista Mill to be processed and handled through export. Originally built in , the mill had to be rebuilt after it was destroyed during the  earthquake. This coffee is traditionally fermented in tanks, washed, and then carefully dried on patios or raised beds. At Bella Vista, careful attention is paid to each detail of processing and dry milling which enables better transparency for each micro lot. They use Grain Pro packaging to protect the coffee from less than ideal environments encountered during travel and storage.
Finca Semillero sits on . hectares of land where, for eleven years, they have cultivated their Tekisic variety, a close relative of classic Bourbon developed in El Salvador. The Zelaya family cultivates Caturra and Tekisic on about three hectares of the farm. Prior to the Zelayas purchase of this land, it was used to farm corn and beans.
The Zelaya familys commitment to maintaining coffee quality starts with the selection of the varieties planted and a focus on ecological stability. After being picked, the coffee from Finca Semillero is washed mechanically at the Zelaya familys Bella Vista Mill on the outskirts of Antigua. Special supervision during the wet and dry milling stages guarantees that only the best is selected for export.  Finally, they ship the green coffee in Grain Pro technology, which protects it from the less than ideal elements encountered during travel and storage.
In , La Roya, also known as coffee leaf rust disease, severely affected Semillero. The Zelayas began a strict pruning and cultivation program to counteract the effects. They are renovating the coffee plants with extensive pruning in order to improve cherry productivity. Leguminose (beans) are being planted among the coffee plants as a natural fertilizer and other organic compost is being added to improve soil conditions on the farm.
Byron Ismael Marroquin now manages Semillero. He and the Zelayas are renovating their coffee plants with aggressive pruning and a stumping project while continuing to replace Catimor with Caturra and Tekisic varieties. They employed advanced soil analysis technologies to achieve the correct balance in the soil for their coffee to thrive. Theyre now able to detect the balance in the soil in real time, rather than waiting for the results of the harvest to know whether inputs worked.
The Zelaya family has recently planted more Tekisic on newly acquired land from their recent purchase of a neighbors farm. The cherries ripened evenly this year, which enabled them to pick the bulk of the harvest at once rather than making multiple sweeps through the farm. They dried the coffee at the Bella Vista mill on new raised beds.
Farm, process and mill coffee from the fabled Antigua region
Ricardo is making his operation even greener with a new technique to recycle the washing water.
Part of the famed Zelaya coffee family (and cousin to Luis Pedro Zelaya Jr), Ricardo is one of our favorite people in the world to visit. Along with his wife, Cynthia, Ricardo has an infectious laugh and brings a sense of joy to everything he does. No trip to his mill is complete without hopping on ATVs to tear up and down the hills.
In Antigua, beautiful th-century Mission architecture is framed by the three large, active volcanoes. Those same volcanoes give this region a rich soil, full of minerals and perfect for growing coffee. Ricardos mill is only about  minutes away from his cousin Luis; from either spot, you can often see the very active Volcan de Fuego (Volcano of Fire) which gives off ash and smoke nearly every day.
Ricardo is constantly investing and inventing  every time we visit, hes come up with a new, improved way to grow coffee. Whether its saving water, ensuring healthier coffee trees, coaching his neighbors on quality and variety, or devising a new system that pays pickers fast and fairly, his mill is always a bustle of activity.
Santa Clara, located in the southern slopes of the Antigua Valley between - meters above sea level, is privileged to have some of the finest volcanic soils for the cultivation of specialty coffee. Santa Clara won many awards for quality such as the Guatemala Cup of Excellence in ,  and .
Ricardo cultivates the coffee at the plantation under strictly controlled shade trees which allow the coffee plants to receive the ideal amount of sunshine required to produce fine and aromatic coffee. Bourbon, Caturra and Catuai varieties have been cultivated at Santa Clara for many years. For the last few years, Ricardo has conducted trials of Bourboncito (Bourbon ). He has been gradually replacing most of the Catuai with either Bourbon or Bourboncito.
The hand-picked fruit is processed traditionally at Ricardos Santa Clara wet mill with crystal clear water. The beans are then patiently dried on tiered, raised beds with a greenhouse style enclosed canopy. The coffee is finally dry milled at either Bella Vista or Pulcal Mill. Every step in the mill is monitored constantly to maintain the quality. Each lot is cupped by two expert cuppers to assure it is up to quality standards.
Recently, Ricardo has been busy upgrading his processing techniques and infrastructure, including implementing a control system that ensures only high quality ripe cherry gets selected. He also installed new tiled tanks and channels to process his coffee using a unique technique to recycle the water, and built a raised bed structure which incorporates tiered beds within a greenhouse style canopy.
This family owned- and operated-farm grows the rare Villalobos variety
This is the third-generation of coffee production for the Torres family
The nine Torres siblings grow the rare Villalobos variety, which only exists in this area of Costa Rica and was first discovered by their grandfather. The family has been growing coffee for three generations; if youre lucky, family patriarch Olivier will be around to play traditional music on the hand-crafted guitars he makes in retirement.
The West Valley region of Costa Rica, besides being the only place on earth where you can find the sweet, floral Villalobos variety, is perfectly lush terrain for growing coffee. We always stop and load up on European-style hard cheeses at a fromagerie between the Torres farm and the Helsar de Zarcero micromill.
After six decades, the Torres siblings continue to innovate while never straying too far from the rigorous standards passed down through the years. Although they continue to be one of the worlds foremost producer of Villalobos, we are delighted that they are now experimenting with other exotic varieties, including the delicate and extraordinary Gesha variety.
The Torres family and Stumptown have developed a longstanding relationship, due to the impeccable quality and consistency of their Villalobos cultivar. As coffee producers, their attention to detail shines in the cultivation of their seedling nursery, the maintenance and nutrition of their coffee plants and in diligent cherry selection.
In the early s, Juan Gonzalez and Salvador Torres pioneered coffee production in the small rural community of Barranca de Naranjo in the West Valley Region of Costa Rica. They began by planting Bourbon and Typica varieties on their small piece of land. Over the years, they discovered a new cultivar appearing on their land, Villalobos, a natural mutation of Typica first discovered in Costa Ricas West Valley town of Sarchi. 
Gonzalez and Torres observed how well the new cultivar was suited to the Barranca terroir and decided to reproduce it. They obtained lots of seedlings and built a nursery to increase production.
Salvadors son, Olivier Torres, inherited the farm and expanded the land to twelve hectares over many years of diligent work. The majority of farmers in the region replaced their Villalobos trees with higher yielding, more disease resistant varieties; but the Torres family decided to continue cultivating the original Villalobos variety due to its wonderful and unique cup profile. 
Truly a family operation, Oliviers three sons Jorge, Henry and Alvaro run the farm. Olivier now cultivates another passion: he makes handcrafted guitars in his workshop just above the terraced hillside where his father began a coffee producing tradition.
Today, the Torres family cultivates Villalobos on eight hectares of their farm, or % of their coffee crop; the rest consists of % Caturra and % Villa Sarchi. 
In order to continue renovating their crop land, , coffee trees were planted in . A mixture of guava, inga and erythrina trees shade the farm, along with citrus trees and other fruit and vegetable crops. 
In , the Torres family conducted an aggressive fertilization program that includes boron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, and other minerals determined by frequent leaf and soil analysis.
The Torres family brings their cherry to Helsar de Zarcero micro mill, located just up the hill in Llano Bonito de Naranjo, for processing. Ricardo Perez, Marvin Rodriguez and Phillip Rodriguez started Helsar in  with the goal of providing traceability to the high quality coffee grown on their farms. 
Today, they process coffee from ten families in the small surrounding area. The mill is well known for sustainable practices such as making organic fertilizer onsite from coffee cherry pulp combined with molasses, mined zinc, boron and other minerals. Microorganisms are cultured from soil collected on nearby mountains and added to the fertilizer in order to provide disease protection to coffee plants. 
Helsar is deeply rooted in the local community and takes action to compensate for its carbon footprint by planting trees in a local biological reserve and using low impact Penagos machinery to process the coffee cherry.
Our Torres Villalobos was meticulously processed with % of the honey still intact after demucilaging. The parchment begins drying under a covered patio similar to a greenhouse then, if the weather permits, they move it to raised beds, or dry it in mechanical dryers.
Recently, the Torres family has utilized selective pruning to combat Roya which is present near their farm. The Helsar micromill also implemented a slower and more controlled drying process in order to increase the stability of the bean. They built additional raised beds and adjusted the time in the mechanical dryers by adding - hours of resting between twelve hour drying cycles to replicate evening cooling which naturally occurs outdoors.

We love the Filtron because its easy to use, consistent and makes a big batch of cold brew concentrate. The initial brew takes - hours, but youll be energetically thanking yourself for it later.


              Theres nothing better than cold brewed coffee on a hot summer day  or if youre like us, any day, really. Cold Brew coffee is naturally smooth and sweet and less acidic than coffee brewed with hot water. The Filtron Cold Water Brewer is a simple way to make several cups  of cold brew concentrate. Cold brewing takes between    hours (we recommend ) but the payoff is huge. This batch should keep you buzzing for days. We recommend a ratio of : coffee concentrate to water over ice, adjusting to taste.

This complex and sweet cup starts with a round, full cherry splash and finishes with warm chocolate and toffee flavors.

A very remote area in Northern Peru with breathtaking landscapes that is a mecca for growing organic coffee.

For us, its worth the rugged trek  we find this region produces incredibly expressive organic coffees.

Decaf shouldnt taste this good. But it does. In fact, it tastes great.
The sweetness of raisins pairs beautifully with caramel in this creamy, buttery cup.

We begin with meticulously sourced beans, choosing only those whose flavors and profiles can stand up to decaffeination. We make that process as gentle as possible with the Swiss Water Decaf process. Pioneered in the s, this is the only certifiably organic way to remove caffeine. This process instead relies on hot water, osmosis, and an activated charcoal filter.
The result is a decaffeinated bean that still carries its own flavors and aromas; our blend brings a lightly sweet but full-bodied experience, and makes an outstanding espresso or cup of drip.

Among those who love Antiguan coffees, the Zelaya family is legendary. Luis represents the fourth generation of this tremendous legacy, and while he honors tradition, he also pushes Antiguan coffee toward the future. He constantly innovates and elevates quality levels, and is instrumental in making Antiguan Coffee a Protected Designation of Origin product, which places them alongside Champagne from the th parallel or prosciutto from southern Italy. Whenever he visits us in Portland, he always wants to stop by the Horse Brass Pub for a local microbrew.
Founded in , Antigua is a regal place, having once been the capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala. It sits in the shadow of three volcanoes  including the very active Fuego Volcano. The last time we visited, Fuego was spewing plumes of ash and the lava was flowing  its that same volcanic ash that contributes to the incredible minerality of the soil, and in turn, the beautiful fruitiness of the coffee.
Luis is unique among our larger producers  he has taken coffee separation and made it a wonderfully meticulous art. He divides his coffee by farm, microclimate, location, date harvested and more  and keeps all of it separate through depulping, processing and drying. The result is an incredible variety of nuanced, distinct coffees with bright, sweet flavor.
Antigua, Guatemala is one of the most renowned coffee producing regions in the world due to its climate, altitude, fertile volcanic soils and farming practices. Antigua sits in a valley scattered with coffee farms surrounded by three volcanoes: Agua, Fuego and Acatenango.
Bella Vista is a farm, wet mill, and dry mill owned by the Zelaya family. With over  years of experience, the Zelaya family is committed to maintaining excellent quality coffee through ecologically stable and environmentally friendly methods.
Our Bella Vista consists of coffee from a combination of % Bourbon lots processed at Bella Vista, some grown by Zelaya himself and some grown by the Hunapu group.
Zelaya also instigated variety separation at Bella Vista farm, which fostered the ability for a lot consisting only of Villa Sarchi, a variety renown for sweetness and brightness. They improved their raised bed infrastructure by converting to three-tiered parabolic drying beds.
Hunapu, the local indigenous Cackchiquel word for the Volcano de Agua, is the name of a group of smallholder producers in the San Miguel Dueas and Ciudad Vieja microregions around Antigua who process their coffee at Bella Vista. Since , Luis Pedro has worked with these farmers to develop meticulous lot separation with the ability to track lots from the farms, to the mill, to the warehouse and to their final destination. He brings his familys commitment to each family he works with for all the coffees milled at Bella Vista.
The Hunapu farmers deliver their red ripe coffee cherry to the Zelaya familys Bella Vista Mill to be processed and handled through export. Originally built in , the mill had to be rebuilt after it was destroyed during the  earthquake. This coffee is traditionally fermented in tanks, washed, and then carefully dried on patios or raised beds. At Bella Vista, careful attention is paid to each detail of processing and dry milling which enables better transparency for each micro lot. They use Grain Pro packaging to protect the coffee from less than ideal environments encountered during travel and storage.
Finca Semillero sits on . hectares of land where, for eleven years, they have cultivated their Tekisic variety, a close relative of classic Bourbon developed in El Salvador. The Zelaya family cultivates Caturra and Tekisic on about three hectares of the farm. Prior to the Zelayas purchase of this land, it was used to farm corn and beans.
The Zelaya familys commitment to maintaining coffee quality starts with the selection of the varieties planted and a focus on ecological stability. After being picked, the coffee from Finca Semillero is washed mechanically at the Zelaya familys Bella Vista Mill on the outskirts of Antigua. Special supervision during the wet and dry milling stages guarantees that only the best is selected for export.  Finally, they ship the green coffee in Grain Pro technology, which protects it from the less than ideal elements encountered during travel and storage.
In , La Roya, also known as coffee leaf rust disease, severely affected Semillero. The Zelayas began a strict pruning and cultivation program to counteract the effects. They are renovating the coffee plants with extensive pruning in order to improve cherry productivity. Leguminose (beans) are being planted among the coffee plants as a natural fertilizer and other organic compost is being added to improve soil conditions on the farm.
Byron Ismael Marroquin now manages Semillero. He and the Zelayas are renovating their coffee plants with aggressive pruning and a stumping project while continuing to replace Catimor with Caturra and Tekisic varieties. They employed advanced soil analysis technologies to achieve the correct balance in the soil for their coffee to thrive. Theyre now able to detect the balance in the soil in real time, rather than waiting for the results of the harvest to know whether inputs worked.
The Zelaya family has recently planted more Tekisic on newly acquired land from their recent purchase of a neighbors farm. The cherries ripened evenly this year, which enabled them to pick the bulk of the harvest at once rather than making multiple sweeps through the farm. They dried the coffee at the Bella Vista mill on new raised beds.

Roasters Notes: This one continues to delight us all.  For the uninitiated, monsooning is a kind of curing or aging that produces huge, bold, punchy coffees with very low acidity.  Unfortunately, monsooning is a tricky process and can easily produce coffee with unpleasant musty or hessian-y taints, or, if the acidity is completely eliminated, can produce a coffee that just seems dead and flat in the cup.Our Aspinwall is the only IMM weve found that is consistently clean and as close to delicate as a monsooned coffee can get, with maple syrup and spice notes and that light-but-not-imperceptible acidity to lift it up. And then, of course, down below is that gigantic, velvety body that punches through milk and doesnt even mind a bit of sugar. Incongruous and mesmerising, like watching a hippo dance ballet.

Ethyl acetate is an ester that is found naturally in several fruits and vegetables and Manizales is known for its many sugar cane plantations, making great use of a local product. Ethyl acetate's low boiling point enables a gentle caffeine extraction from the coffee bean, while pressure or excessive heat treatment are avoided and the natural structure of the green coffee bean cells are retained.

Swiss Water Process involves first soaking the coffee in pure water. The green coffee extract that results is then passed through a carbon filter, specifically engineered to filter out the caffeine molecule. The green coffee extract is then introduced to the coffee but without the caffeine. This process is simple in theory, but impressive to execute, since the coffee has to be dried and preserved in an exacting way to ensure the inherent flavour of the coffee remains relatively unscathed.
Great as both a filter, and an espresso, the cup profile is sweet, and subtle with flavours of cocoa, and caramel.

This Coava exclusive is named for the beautiful blossoms found on coffee trees before harvest.
Black tea, honey comb, and sweet rose blossom mark the Meaza among the most delicious Ethiopian coffees we have ever tasted.

When Coava Coffee Roasters began packaging coffee by the kilogram in  our intention was twofold: First: Our roaster has been designed to operate most efficiently by the kilogram. By sticking to the metric system and maintaining strict roast cycles, weve been able to reduce our waste to less than one pound of coffee per week. This careful planning is another way we show respect for the work of the coffee producers we represent. Second: Roasting by the kilogram allows us to package our coffees in  gram increments. Known as the Coava , our retail bags promote freshness, dissuade waste, and divide evenly with most brew methods. It is the perfect quantity for the average coffee drinker.
To show respect for the full chain of quality coffee (sourcing, roasting, preparing) we do not offer any blends. Our coffees carry the names of the co-ops and individual farmers who harvest, process, and prepare them for us. We commit to show honor where honor is due.
We only partner with producers who are mindful of their people, their environment, and their crop. The farms we work with take great care of their coffee from seedling to harvest, through processing and storing, and finally in packaging. It is through these sustainable partnerships that we ensure the longevity of the coffee beans and the final quality in the cup.
We only work with the best importers and exporters. Their transparency, care for the farmers, and quality of transportation and storage of our coffees is absolutely essential. These partners are rarely heralded, but hold our industry together. Once the coffees arrive in Portland we move them directly into our green room. This temperature controlled room combines several proprietary practices and ensures that all of the work done before us is kept intact.
b: an occupation or trade requiring manual dexterity or artistic skill
Coava travels the world in pursuit of coffees with the highest quality, complexity, and balance. We take an exhaustive hands-on approach to coffee as an agricultural process. Dedicating ourselves to learning about soil conditions, sustainable farming practices, varietal mutations, and plant diseases are only a few of the areas of specialty that have helped us source outstanding coffees.
Each year, we spend months at origin courting the most conscientious coffee producers. We use our resources to build better processing facilities, introduce the best preservation practices, and spotlight individual farmers. We also collaborate with coffee mills to buy a farmers full harvest. This stands in opposition to the common practice of only purchasing parts of the harvest and leaving the farmer with the harder-to-sell remnants. Our rare approach ensures the purchase of an entire farms production at a higher price. We still get the top-tier separations, but weve also found a home for the rest of the coffees with the local coffee mill.
We make these efforts to establish mutually beneficial partnerships with the men and women producing the coffees we adore.
We are committed to the inherent qualities within each unroasted coffee. We strive to compose beautiful roast profiles that highlight the tremendous work that has been performed by the coffee producers each harvest. We never blend coffees and whenever possible we name them after the farmers who grow them. We are constantly tasting, documenting, and reevaluating our profiles to ensure that we enable individual coffees to shine.
After everything has been said and done Coava is rooted in preparing exceptional beverages. Our passion for balanced & sweet espresso, perfect milk drinks, and delicious brewed coffee brings our baristas together as craftsmen. We push for consistent excellence by refining our skills through palate calibration, systematic preparation, and self-critique. This dedication has earned our team many first place honors in the Barista Competitions.
a: given to general and cordial reception of guests
At Coavas core is the desire to share the delicious coffees that we are excited about. We never dreamed that the pursuit of such a simple goal would surround us with all of the incredible people that make up the Coava family. From our shops dedicated regulars to coffee lovers around the globe, we enjoy coffee together. Weve danced and celebrated, barbequed and tinkered, but also dug in deep and supported one another.
In similar fashion we would not be who we are without great partnerships. We problem solve harvest and processing issues alongside farmers. We help coffee shops all over the United States open, build up, and expand their businesses. We raise money and resources alongside non-profits to benefit our community. With these amazing partners Coava has been honored to grow, learn, and succeed.
b: northwest coffee roaster notoriously fueled by good folks and Led Zeppelin
Coava began in Matt Higgins garage in . The veteran barista and roaster bootstrapped the company by repairing motorcycles. His ambitions were to one day roast and prepare coffees that would be exciting for baristas and inviting to everyday drinkers. To do this, Matt knew that sourcing excellent "coava" would have to be the anchor of everything he did.
So he studied agriculture, farm practices, and sustainable business. He learned from everyone that he could and at the first chance he began traveling to the major coffee growing regions. He sought farmers whose careful work was producing quality crops with the type of complexity and balance that many single origin coffees didn't have at the time. His willingness to do what others would not eventually earned him a reputation among coffee producers as a respectful, diligent, and honest man. Those early years were adventurous and difficult, but laid the foundation for the many long-standing partnerships Coava has with farmers today.
With great coffees in hand, Coava began sharing them through a handful of Pacific Northwest coffeehouses. These early believers led the way for Coava to open our brew bar and roastery in southeast Portland in . We are indebted to and thankful for their support on this journey.
#coavainsight: The word Coava was introduced by William Biddulph to the western world in  in The Travels of a Certayne Englishmen in Africa, Asia, etc... Begunne in  and By Some of Them Finished-this Yeere .

Big Trouble offers nutty, caramel flavors people know and love, which may seem easyâ€”and our goal is to make it easy to enjoy in any brewerâ€”but it's actually one of the most challenging for us, because clean, sweet, low-acidity coffees from small-scale farms can be elusive.
Hologram is our update of the classic Mocha Java flavor profile. Fruit-forward and chocolatey coffees combine to create something distinctly complex.
We pay extra attention to decaf because we know people love it solely for its flavor. For Slow Motion, we start with great coffeeâ€”from the same farmers we work with for all of our coffeesâ€”and decaffeinate it in small batches using chemical-free water processing.

On New Years Day we woke up at Ryan the roasters house. Some people were getting antsy to wade through the rain to a caf or bar or something, but Ryan the roaster wasnt having it. Its nice and warm here, he said.Lets all just take our shirts off, and relax.
Thats how we got the idea for this subscription. We want everyone to stay home, take their shirts off, and relax. We also ship to offices, where you can enjoy all the benefits of our subscription program except for the part about staying home, removing your shirt, and relaxing.
No matter where you are, the single origin subscription gets you a different coffee from a single origin (like a certain farm in Guatemala or co-op in Ethiopia) each delivery. If you are getting more than one bag, each coffee will be different. We choose; you enjoy. The espresso subscription gets you Friendo Blendo unless you get more than one bag, in which case we throw in a single origin espresso with each delivery. We roast; you relax.
Fellow club member, there's just one more step. Meet us over in the CART for the initiation ceremony.

We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as bakers chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.

Our Colombian El Diviso microlot, comes from producer Maximino Diaz small farm that sits in the Central Andes at a , foot elevation. The Tolima region, that is home to Maximino, is experiencing a transformationfrom poverty and violence, due to the Colombian conflict, to a rebounding market for their high quality beans, offering a vehicle of change for its people.
In addition to producing fine coffee beans, Maximino is dedicated to nurturing his land and its wildlife. He not only grows sustenance crops such as maize and beans, he has also created a small nature reserve that provides a nesting site for the Colombian chachalaca. This turkey-like, native bird is not endangered but has seen a continual declining population. It is Maximinos commitment to give back to the land that has been so generous to him.
El Diviso is a complex coffee withcinnamon and milk chocolate aromas, mandarin and meyer lemon acidity andsmooth cashew butter undertones.

To drink a cup of Ethiopia Nigusse Lemma is to connect with the origins of coffee. Beans from Ethiopias Limu woreda (district) deliver unique flavors that can only be discovered in heirloom varietals. Located in the southwestern part of country, Limu is not as well known as Yirgacheffe or Harrar, but deserves the attention that it is receiving.
Our Ethiopia Niguisse Lemma is sourced from the family farm of Lemma Edeto and is located in the highest elevations of the Limu region. Shade from old growth trees, water from spring fed stream, and native varietal of coffee that flourish organically are in no better hands than the Edeto Family. Lemma, with over  years in the coffee industry, has passed down the knowledge to his sons Nigusse and Haile, who operate the farm which their father recovered after it was confiscated by the Derg regime in the s. The familys commitment to quality includes a fully natural dry processing that insures no unripend cherries taint the taste of the finished product. Fully control from farming to milling has resulted in award-winning coffee. Nigusse and family were recently honored for the African Taste of the Harvest competition awarded by the African Fine Coffee Association.

The most common source of fuel used to supply a coffee roaster with heat is gas. We are, however, the first and only roaster in the United States to roast coffee beans exclusively over a fire fueled by Oak Wood. The differences are not what one might initially expect. Unlike cooking with a wood oven or grill, where the smoke from the wood imparts a flavor to the final product, the main difference between wood and conventional roasting lies in the quality of the heat delivered to the beans. Heat derived from wood has higher moisture content and is better suited for slow roasting.
The more oil preserved within the bean, the more exquisite the final flavor will be. The natural humidity within the wood seems to envelop the beans during the roasting process, hence preserving more of the lipids within. Meanwhile, the slow roasting aspect ensures the coffee is lower in acidity and higher in body. The result is most apparent in our espresso, yielding more crema, fuller flavor, and a smoother finish. For drip coffee for which we actually wish to retain the acidity of the coffees, we subject the beans to a faster roasting time.
The unique advantages of wood roasting do not come without challenges, as the use of such an inconsistent fuel (i.e. wood) creates difficulties in maintaining consistency between roasts. A nightmare for an inexperienced operator, years of experience of roasting with wood are required to develop the intuition and instinct necessary to master the process. Luckily for us, with  years of wood roasting under our belt, we are able to claim this as an advantage; since through the unpredictable nature of roasting with wood, we are required to be attentive and obsessive with each and every roast: nothing can replace the skilled guidance of our experienced roasters. However, never the ones to be overconfident, we still go through extra steps to ensure consistency and quality.
We begin by selecting well seasoned wood from responsible suppliers. We then utilize thermocouple data collected at key locations on the roaster along with VFD motor control, which allows to make fan and drum speed adjustments during the roasting process. The wood smoke emissions are then abated by high powered afterburners which are in full compliance with local air quality standards. Combining these tools with our years of experience, we are able to maintain control of the roasting process with a very high level of consistency. As you can see, wood roasting is an artisan craft where human experience using old world methods, combined with the latest technological advances in roasting, delicately blend art and science. We hope you will enjoy a distinctive coffee experience which is impossible to duplicate.

			A great single origin is a truly exceptional coffee that highlights the intrinsic qualities of that region while being able to stand on its own as a unique and enjoyable cup of coffee.

To drink a cup of Ethiopia Nigusse Lemma is to connect with the origins of coffee. Beans from Ethiopias Limu woreda (district) deliver unique flavors that can only be discovered in heirloom varietals. Located in the southwestern part of country, Limu is not as well known as Yirgacheffe or Harrar, but deserves the attention that it is receiving.
Our Ethiopia Niguisse Lemma is sourced from the family farm of Lemma Edeto and is located in the highest elevations of the Limu region. Shade from old growth trees, water from spring fed stream, and native varietal of coffee that flourish organically are in no better hands than the Edeto Family. Lemma, with over  years in the coffee industry, has passed down the knowledge to his sons Nigusse and Haile, who operate the farm which their father recovered after it was confiscated by the Derg regime in the s. The familys commitment to quality includes a fully natural dry processing that insures no unripend cherries taint the taste of the finished product. Fully control from farming to milling has resulted in award-winning coffee. Nigusse and family were recently honored for the African Taste of the Harvest competition awarded by the African Fine Coffee Association.

Arnulfo Leguizamo is who every cafetero in Colombia should aspire to be. He is a member of Asociacion Los Naranjos, a project we have developed over the years were we pay a premium for coffees that meet certain cup-quality specifications.
In , he won the first price at the Cup of Excellence with coffee from this farm. An unprecedented price of $/lb was paid for the Cup of Excellence coffee. He promised his family he would take them to see the ocean and he already did. (He showed us the pictures to prove it).
Arnulfo is very proud to be a farmer. What this new generation of cafeteros wants is recognition for their hard work and the means to sell their coffee as a traceable microlot and not a blend.
We met Diego, his son, at the Los Naranjos cupping lab. He is training to be a cupper at the moment and plans to stay in the business. Farmers are now starting to understand the importance of being able to taste their own coffee.
We are really excited for Arnulfo and Los Naranjos' future! It looks promising and should bring us more top-notch coffee throughout the years.

This is added to water, and applied to the green coffee to dissolve the caffeine completely out of the beans. The caffeine is separated from the greens and is steamed and washed with more water.

Region: San Agustin, HuilaFarm: Finca PrimaveraVarietal: CaturraProducer:Arnulfo LeguizamoAltitude:  MASLProcessing Method:Fully Washed and Sundried
Arnulfo Leguizamo is who every cafetero in Colombia should aspire to be. He is a member of Asociacion Los Naranjos, a project we have developed over the years were we pay a premium for coffees that meet certain cup-quality specifications.
In , he won the first price at the Cup of Excellence with coffee from this farm. An unprecedented price of $/lb was paid for the Cup of Excellence coffee. He promised his family he would take them to see the ocean and he already did. (He showed us the pictures to prove it).
Arnulfo is very proud to be a farmer. What this new generation of cafeteros wants is recognition for their hard work and the means to sell their coffee as a traceable microlot and not a blend.
We met Diego, his son, at the Los Naranjos cupping lab. He is training to be a cupper at the moment and plans to stay in the business. Farmers are now starting to understand the importance of being able to taste their own coffee.
We are really excited for Arnulfo and Los Naranjos' future! It looks promising and should bring us more top-notch coffee throughout the years.

This process is known as E.A. Sugarcane. It starts by fermenting molasses to create ethanol and combining it with acetic acidfound in vinegarto make ethyl acetate. This is added to water, and applied to the green coffee to dissolve the caffeine completely out of the beans. The caffeine is separated from the greens and is steamed and washed with more water.
This is truly an exceptional cup of coffee with flavors of citrus, caramel, and honey.

Weve had the pleasure of working with the Desarrollo producer group in the town of Gigante, Colombia, for a number of years now, so were happy to announce the launch of Los Gigantes Decaf. 
In an effort to create a decaf that matches the caliber of our regular offerings, we pre-selected coffees with a bright and sweet profile before they are sent to be decaffeinated. At the Descafecol plant in Manizales, the caffeine is removed, as though by magic, using naturally occurring Ethyl Acetate derived from sugar cane. You'll find Ethyl Acetate in green coffee as well as various fruits, and it is the most common ester in wine. 
The resulting coffee is intensely sweet and fruited both in aroma and flavor, with notes ofbanana bread, preserved cherries, and chocolate pudding!
Need a quick and thoughtful gift for a host (or just want to treat yourself)? This sweet duo is just the thing:
The Classic Ritual Mug or a Pillarbox Red Falcon Enamelware Mug (let us know in the comments :)
A  oz-bag of the coffee that our head roaster deems worthy of your generous heart!
Our newest coffee from Rwanda comes from the community of Kanyege, located in the southwestern mountains of the country, near Lake Kivu. Bourbon variety coffee cherries are grown on small, privately owned farms before being delivered to the Kanyege washing station. This coffee is an interesting mix of round, comforting flavors underlying a racy fruit acidity. Look for flavors of peach nectar and lemon brisk tea, sitting atop a warm background of hazelnuts and cocoa nibs.
Nyeri County, situated right between the slopes of Mount Kenya and the lush Aberdare National Park, is one of the world's most renowned coffee growing regions. With high altitude, rich volcanic soil, and ample access to fresh clean water, the terroir is perfect for growing great tasting coffees. As is typical in this region, this lot is the product of many small-holder farmers, who work collectively at the Kiamania factory. At the factory, the coffee is carefully fermented, washed and dried on raised beds, with special attention paid to sorting out the absolute best at every stage of the process. The result is a very floral cup of coffee, with clean flavors of raspberry, cherry and lime.
Nelson is an exceptional and unusual coffee producer for the El Cielito region. Hes a trainedagronomist and botanist, and manages his expansive farm in a very professional manner, denselyplanting his Catuai variety trees in manicured rows to maximize production. While we typicallyassociate big production yields with diminished quality, Nelson very carefully monitors his plants,driving up from the village daily in an old Dodge truck to insure they are all healthy and vigorous.
Nicknaming the farm Chely, after his mother, shows a softer side of Nelson that isnt all business,and his sense of humor is as honed and effective as his growing practices. The fruits of all this laborare tremendously sweet, with a light nuanced acidity that has become a hallmark of great coffees fromthis region. Nelson has done much to challenge notions of traditional coffee cultivation, but its hard todisagree with his delicious results.
In the Haight-Ashbury scene of the s, side door became a kind of stand-in term for the transgression of norms in a tumultuous period. It also signified a different way of looking at things, an alternative that, like many, would become suspiciously mainstream. It is in that revolutionary Aquarian spirit we offer you our Spring seasonal espresso blend, Side Door.
In the world of coffee, Brasil has always conjured up the image of body. The coffees that hail from this country are heavy, sweet, and bring the creamy viscosity that are reminiscent of some of the best memories of espresso. The two Brasils featured in this blend are no different.
The first, Ip Rosa, has a sweetness and silkiness like heavy cream with candied chestnuts and Caramelo. And, the second, well this Brasil really changes the game when it comes to the concept of a traditional Brasil coffee. Bulldog, as it is affectionately known, starts off with the mild German chocolate cake notes, and then hits you with the funk of grapefruit peel and hops.
The other half of Side Door is a duo of African coffees, representing the more experimental, bright side of the blend.The Rwandan Cotecaga is always a favorite around here with its foundation of the sweetness of graham cracker and higher notes of grilled watermelon and lime.
Our fourth component, Konyu heads into the mix. Konyu hails from Kenya, and provides a bright fruited melody to the Door, with notes of peach, blood orange, and a silky body. 
This quartet of coffees comes together in the following manner: a fruit-flower accord of watermelon, lime and jasmine on top; a rich and smooth texture like ganache in the middle; and an overwhelmingly cookie-like sweetness. That is to say, its balanced in a way that some other blends can only hope to be. It can be sweet, easygoing, and traditional; yet forward-looking, experimental and far-out - all while staying quintessentially Ritual.

The Souza family has long been part of what we do here at Ritual. For years Joo Souza, affectionately called Ziho amongst his friends and family, had been doing things a bit differently in Brasil. After the devastating 'Black' frost of  and the subsequentskyrocketing of coffee prices all over Brasil, farmers started turning their focus to producing coffee for volume. Ever a man of tradition, Ziho kept producing coffee the way his father taught him, and in turn, passed on his talent and wisdom to his children and grandchildren. Today, his son Bruno works the land in the same way as his father, picking coffee only when at its peak, processing cherries carefully in small batches, and ultimately striving for the best coffee he can produce - not just the most coffee he can produce. This Sweet Tooth offering is a blend of Rubi and Catua cherries dried carefully over - days in the natural method and then milled directly on the farm. The care in producing this spectacular offering comes through with amazing clean and complex flavors - look for notes of ripe peach and apricot brightened with a light orange acidity over a backdrop of syrupy sweet milk chocolate.
As a roaster that is committed to promoting our producers and bringing them out of anonymity, single origin espresso has always been important to us. The best shots of espresso we've ever had have been single origin--dynamic, sweet, and complex. They are balanced, and good in milk to boot.
Throughout the year we will be showcasing eight to twelve single producers in homage to our original Sweet Tooth blend. An anti-blend that explicitly showcased the producers whose coffees comprised it. Sweet Tooth will be a rotating single origin on which we've put our stamp of approval as a great shot of espresso.

Creamery is our mainstay blend of seasonal coffees that emphasizes depth and balance in the cup. Great for vibrant, silky espresso and chocolatey, sweet drip.
Current blend is Colombia Robinson Figueroa, Colombia Ignacio Quintero, Ethiopia Birbirsa.
We enjoy our espresso extractions on the longer side to really pull out a lot of the complexity. Try  g in /  g out around  sec and adjust to taste. As filter/drip we typically brew at - g coffee and  ml water using Kalita, Hario or similar pourover style. In this method of prep expect a greater presence of dried fruit notes and a range of chocolate flavors.

We enjoy our espresso extractions on the longer side to really pull out a lot of the complexity. Try  g in /  g out around  sec and adjust to taste. As filter/drip we typically brew at - g coffee and  ml water using Kalita, Hario or similar pourover style. In this method of prep expect a greater presence of dried fruit notes and a range of chocolate flavors.
We roast and ship on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. Orders placed Thurs through Sunday will roast and ship Monday.

SimmonsBibleCollege.com offers free tips, tricks, guidelines and manuals for students worldwide.
Youve come to a very important turning point in your life. Its time to leave the safety of public education and head out into the unknown territories of higher learning! Youve written your essays, sent in your applications and now  now its just a matter of picking the right college. This isnt a decision you want to rush in to. Picking your college is a very important decision, and should be treated with care. There are several things you need to consider before selecting your appropriate college.
The first thing youll need to ask yourself is this: what do I want to study? All colleges have different programs and different areas of strengths. Some colleges specialize in pre-law, while others tend to focus in education or communication. What is it that you want to study? If you already have a clear idea of your future career path, then choose schools that will help you on your way there. Pre-med students, for example, shouldnt attend liberal arts colleges with no medical programs. Students that know what careers the want should pick specific schools that specialize in their field. If youre unsure about what you want to do, or where you want your future career to go, your best bet is to select a larger, more general studies college. You can take a variety of classes and explore several different fields in your first semester. From there, you should be able to narrow down your education choices.
There are several other aspects to choosing a great college. Realistically, youll need to consider price. What is the average cost of your prospective colleges, and can you afford them? Unfortunately, you may have to rule out some choices due to financial constraints  although you can always work hard for scholarships! Other issues may involve distance. Is the college on the other side of the country, when you want to stay close to home? Or do you want to get far away and try to make it on your own? Consider that youll be at your college for the better part of at least four years, so make sure its in a location you approve of.
Lastly, consider other activities, facilities and extracurricular events the college offers. If you love to swim and be on a swim team, it might be hard to attend a college without a swimming pool. Theres more to going to college than your academic path; the college also provides the majority of the activities and social events youll experience for the next few years. Consider what kinds of facilities, clubs, sports and other groups exist at different colleges before you select your final choice.

That consistently earns higher returns on smaller investments. At the end of the day, this is a benefit to everyone. But especially to day traders in particular. Binary is a computer-related terminology that means composed of two parts. When applied to trading, it signifies a trading contract where there are only two outcomes possible and they are one or zero. In other words, it is all or nothing at all.
Simply put, trading binary options involves a contract where, based upon a specific price movement or condition, a disbursement will be made to the trader in a fixed amount. This is dependent upon the traders contract ending in the money. If it does, he or she will receive a disbursement. If, on the other hand, it ends out of the money, then there is no disbursement at expiration time.
One of the other major reasons why the attraction for many traders, especially beginners, is growing so quickly is the fact that binary options investors are taking part in a contract that has a specific payment and contract length. This feature is not available in Forex investing. This is where investors have no possible way of really knowing when to cash in or what specific return amount will be received. On the other hand, binary options trading gives investors the pertinent information regarding the exact expiration date and time of the contract and how much their return will be if they end up in the money at that time. That contract period of time could be anywhere from just a few minutes up to a week. Payout at expiration could be as high as  percent.
They are called binary options basically because there are only two potential results. One result is a fixed percentage payoff and the other is just plain nothing. In some cases they may also be called all-or-nothing options, digital options, or fixed return options. The binary option terminology has mostly been used in Europe. In the U.S., they are often called one-touch options, knock-in binary options, or two-asset binary options. The two basic types of binary options are:

Watch out for trading scams

How to Spot a Scam Robot?

Poor Website Design.This is my number one signal. Scammers do not bother to spend time or money to make decent web pages.Usually, they see an opportunity to make fast money and immediately take full advantage of it. In particular, I recommend paying attention to potential image manipulations. Some unnamed scammers are using photo-shopped celebrity images on their webpages. While some websites are so amateurishly made that everyone can easily see that they are not trustworthy. On the other hand, if the website is as stylish as websites of large companies, it is very likely that it was made with honest goals in mind.
No Information about Robots Features.If you cannot find any information about the robots features anywhere, it is very likely that the features are very bad, or the robot is extremely simple. In the worst case, the only feature is that the robot ensures that you will lose your investments. Everyhonest binary options software has a very wide range of possibilities to customize its functions according to the desired parameters.
No Previous Trading History.If you cannot find any information about past trades, this is a huge red flag. If the robot were actually able to make a profit, why would the developers hide its results? This just does not make sense. Many robots promise high profits for their users, but when they try to locate where these profits exactly came from, this is almost impossible to determine.

Along with gaining experience, a prospective business coach also needs to learn the skills needed to become an effective coach and mentor. Business coaching courses can help you do just that.
Providing business coaching to employees can result in significant performance gains, in terms of them becoming more effective at achieving the targets and objectives of their employer.
Because of the individual and one-to-one nature of a coaching session, the rapport between the person and the coach is extremely important, and is why the coach needs to be highly skilled.
Overcoming barriers will not only make the individual feel better, but there are numerous benefits for the company, which is why the cost of business coaching can prove to be such a worthwhile investment.
Welcome to the Business Coaching Hub. This website not only provides information on the subject of business coaching and related topics such as mentoring and training courses, but also provides links to some of the leading providers of these services. This means that if you cannot find the answers to your business coaching questions here, you should be able to find them by visiting one of these other websites.
The actual definition of business coaching is rather ambiguous and difficult to define precisely, but can be described as the process of maximising the effectiveness of a person in the workplace. This is typically achieved through the identification, tackling and overcoming of metaphorical obstacles and challenges which are preventing the individual from reaching their full potential. Business coaching can be utilised to address problems which have been avoided for years or have not been able to be solved through other methods such as traditional training courses or personal research.
One of the key strengths of business coaching is that it is suitable for anybody working for the company. From the chief executive down to shop floor workers, everybody is highly likely to have at least one problem or issues which is preventing them from working to their full potential. Rather than a training course which needs to be pitched at the right level in order to be relevant for the tasks and responsibilities of those particular course attendees - and as such could have large sections which are totally irrelevant and therefore not useful - business coaching sessions will be tailored to the needs of the individual and consequently % relevant.
The individual benefits of business coaching can be varied, but all will have the ultimate objective of increasing the effectiveness of a person to do a particular job and their contribution to the achievement of the company's goals.
One of the downsides to business coaching is that it is often more expensive as a means of employee and manager development than attending a training course, or even arranging an in-house course, will be. This is because business coaching is typically provided on a one-to-one basis and spread over a number of sessions, sometimes indefinitely (particularly where executive coaching is concerned).
Business coaching and executive coaching however, because of its personalised nature, often delivers superior results, especially when the individual being coached does not need to learn any additional information as they would on a course, but simply needs to put their existing knowledge to work in a different way, or overcome objectives to enable them to do this. As a result, whilst the cost of coaching is almost certainly a consideration, many mangers recognise that it is often worth paying more to achieve such high results, as the long term benefits to the company typically outweigh the initial expenditure required.
For those who already have extensive knowledge of a subject, particularly those who have had this knowledge refreshed recently on a training course, then business coaching will normally be the better option. Individuals will already have the knowledge required to perform their job role to a high standard, but may need to overcome issues and barriers which are holding them back and preventing them from fulfilling their maximum potential. The business coaching and mentoring sessions can help to fully-identify these problems, and assist in devising action plans to tackle and overcome them.
Anybody who does not already have the necessary level of knowledge would benefit more from a training course, as they will need to be taught this information before they can put it to good use in the workplace for the benefit of the company. One of the primary reasons for a person not producing output to a suitable standard is due to a lack of knowledge and understanding about how to perform the task in the most efficient manner. If they have never been taught how to do it, there should be little surprise in them failing to implement it. Similarly, business coaching to overcome barriers and help them maximise their effectiveness will have little impact if they do not already have the necessary education for how to do the task(s) to a high standard.
This concept applies to all forms of training as far as employees in businesses are concerned. Whether it is management training, interpersonal skills, team working or health and safety training, the same requirement for learning the information and then being able to successfully apply it to the workplace will need to be taken into account. Coaching and training courses are therfore vitally important, but the two are not mutually exclusive, and the best improvement will come to those who actually receive both simultaneously. The training courses will provide the information, whilst the coaching and mentoring sessions will enable the individual to use this knowledge to its maximum effectiveness for the benefit of the business. Yes it will be expensive, but the returns on this investment will often prove to be highly worthwhile in the long term because of the significantly increased productivity, efficiency and overall contribution of the individual towards the achievement of the company's aims and objectives. Plus, as far as health and safety is concerned, providing training in this area may ultimately save lives too!

If you go to your temporary url (http://ip/~username/) and get this error, there maybe a problem with the rule set stored in an .htaccess file. You can try renaming that file to .htaccess-backup and refreshing the site to see if that resolves the issue.
It is also possible that you have inadvertently deleted your document root or the your account may need to be recreated. Either way, please contact HostGator immediately via phone or live chat so we can diagnose the problem.
Are you using WordPress? See the Section on  errors after clicking a link in WordPress.

In this example the file must be in public_html/example/Example/
Notice that the CaSe is important in this example. On platforms that enforce case-sensitivity example and Example are not the same locations.
For addon domains, the file must be in public_html/addondomain.com/example/Example/ and the names are case-sensitive.
When you have a missing image on your site you may see a box on your page with with a red X where the image is missing. Right click on the X and choose Properties. The properties will tell you the path and file name that cannot be found.

When working with WordPress,  Page Not Found errors can often occur when a new theme has been activated or when the rewrite rules in the .htaccess file have been altered.
When you encounter a  error in WordPress, you have two options for correcting it.
This will reset the permalinks and fix the issue in many cases. If this doesn't work, you may need to edit your .htaccess file directly.
Add the following snippet of code to the top of your .htaccess file:

										# BEGIN WordPress
										<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
										RewriteEngine On
										RewriteBase /
										RewriteRule ^index.php$ - [L]
										RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
										RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
										RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
										</IfModule>
										# End WordPress
									
If your blog is showing the wrong domain name in links, redirecting to another site, or is missing images and style, these are all usually related to the same problem: you have the wrong domain name configured in your WordPress blog.
The .htaccess file contains directives (instructions) that tell the server how to behave in certain scenarios and directly affect how your website functions.
Redirects and rewriting URLs are two very common directives found in a .htaccess file, and many scripts such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla and Magento add directives to the .htaccess so those scripts can function.
It is possible that you may need to edit the .htaccess file at some point, for various reasons.This section covers how to edit the file in cPanel, but not what may need to be changed.(You may need to consult other articles and resources for that information.)
The easiest way to edit a .htaccess file for most people is through the File Manager in cPanel.
Before you do anything, it is suggested that you backup your website so that you can revert back to a previous version if something goes wrong.

Tucked off of West St. in Annapolis, Ceremony's coffeehouse sits just in front of our roastery and offers a leading edge coffee and espresso program.
The possibilities are practically endless when opening a coffee space in our nation's capital. Do you embrace the traditional cafe route, focus on amazing food, or cross-over with another unique business? There are so many potentials in Washington DC, but we decided the best way to serve our community right now is through a space that educates and makes accessible your coffee ritual. Our DC Workshop doesn't have cafe service or food (except at parties!). Rather, it focuses on wholesale + public classes, free weekly coffee breaks, and bringing people together in our vibrant District coffee community!
You can find us at  st St. NW #B in Hamilton Court, which is a small collection of buildings in Georgetown that features a fascinating, coffee-filled past: http://georgetownmetropolitan.com////georgetowns-lost-beatnik-past/
Link up for maps of all our locations: http://ceremonycoffee.com/coffeehouse
Whether you want to attend one of our free Weekly Coffee Breaks, take a wholesale partner class, or a home barista class, we've got you covered! Check out http://ceremonycoffee.com/events for the happenings at each of our locations.
Say hello to Annuals, Ceremony's twist on a seasonal blend series! By offering new, unique blends based on in-season coffees, seasonally appropriate flavors, and fun themes, we intend to engage your palate, mind, and aesthetic eye! 
In the Spring, Summer, and Fall, you can expect us to highlight coffees from the Northern Hemisphere (Meso America, northerly Africa, northerly South Asia and Pacific Islands). In the Fall, Winter, and Spring, the Southern Hemisphere will reign (South America, southerly Africa, southerly South Asia and Pacific Islands). Why blend with freshly harvested coffee? Because it tastes better than that roasted from old green coffee. Once a coffee berry is picked from the tree, the clock is ticking!
Annuals are also about blending to create distinctive seasonal flavor experiences:
Winter - Full-bodied + Balanced - It's not just heartier food we crave in chilly, Hibernal months. Stay warm with this rich, deep, and comforting blend.
Spring - Bright + Sweet - With the world reawakening around us, this lively, elegant blend will rejuvenate your taste buds with light, fresh flavors.
Summer - Sweet + Iced-focused - How do you like your iced coffee? This blend will make a perfectly sweet, full cold cup for those hot, sticky days.
Fall - Progressive Series - Back to school! Learn what a difference blending makes by experiencing all four, unique versions of this experimental project.
Holiday - Berry-forward + Rich - Gather round with family and friends to enjoy this fruity, sweet, and full-bodied blend that will satisfy everyone in your household.
One other quite interesting thing about Annuals. We are roasting these blends in-between our light peak and espresso profiles. You may have noticed that traditionally, all of our single origins and house blends are light roast profiles, while our espressos are medium roast profiles. These roast levels are a big part of what makes us Ceremony. So why change our roasting for Annuals? There are a couple of reasons. The biggest is that we want these blends to be easily brewable as filter and espresso. Through roast profiling and tasting by our QA team, we find the sweet spot in between our two typical roast levels that makes these blends accessible to your pour over dripper or espresso machine. Read on below to see our recommended brewing parameters for this profile. The other big reason for splitting the difference is that we want Annuals to be a blend everyone can get excited about! By developing the coffees just that little bit more, we feel that the added depth and body will offer a wonderful complement to our lighter, cleaner, and more elegant roasts. We hope you agree! 
Since Annuals roasts are slightly more developed, the rule of thumb will be that compared to our light peak roasts, you'll want to brew stronger ratio-wise and grind more coarsely. Compared to our espresso roasts, you'd want to brew Annuals weaker ratio-wise and grind finer. Annuals are basically the middle bowl of porridge, not too hot, not too cold, just right!

Hard to believe it's that time of year again! Though the weather hasn't given us a cold shoulder yet, the leaves are exploding with radiance, as is my family about the season's festivities. Commence with the texting! Though I'm not a big fan of holiday creep (Christmas in July, anyone?), past years of procrastination have left me scrambling. This year, I promised myself that I'll be different, starting with making sure I have the perfect coffee for Thanksgiving (Don't forget the Decaf either! Seriously, our Decaf Colombia is really good!). Thankfully, we're releasing our Holiday Blend  this week, so you and I can check great coffee off our lists nice and early (Did you know most of our coffees taste better with almost a week of rest off-roast?). There will be fresh roasts every week through Christmas, so stop back often to recharge, as we're pretty sure your company will love this full, sweet, satisfying coffee!
To build this two-bean blend, we started with the idea that a holiday coffee should be well-liked by everyone in your house. We also wanted it to pair well with traditional holiday food, drink, and dessert. To do this, we began with our Ethiopia Wazzala Natural - a coffee with a big personality that brings a barrelfull of dark red fruit to the cup. Imagine ripe cranberries followed by a sip of red wine. Of course, every leading character needs a foil to bring out the best in both, so we experimented with blending several different coffees before striking gold with the Honduras Jaguar Land III. Though it sounds more like the latest B-movie blockbuster than delicious coffee, trust us when we say this washed Central just works as a contrast to its fruitier Natural counterpart. Adding a deep, molasses-like sweetness and warming spice aromatics, the Jaguar Land's deeply steady Spock plays the perfect sidekick to the Wazzala's flamboyant Kirk, creating a fuller, more complex, more satisfying cup. 
We wish you and your family a wonderful holiday season!
If you pressed me, I'd probably tell you that I prefer Washed coffees over Natural coffees ninety-nine times out of a hundred. I'm not trying to be a Natural hater. It's just that I enjoy Washed coffees' cleaner flavor (as a result of fewer defects and little-to-no fermentation), sparkling acidity, and engaging mouthfeel more. Every once in a while though, a Natural coffee comes along that tastes clean, berrylicious, but not too fermenty, and just incredibly delightful. Our Ethiopia Wazzala Natural is such a coffee, tasting of strawberry, cherry, and raisins, which is why I'm super excited about this year's version of Asymmetries!
You all know the deal - Asymmetries is a progressive espresso series predicated around two coffees, one washed and one natural. This year, it's the Ethiopia Wazzala Natural as mentioned, and the Ethiopia Beriti Washed. We'll start with a blend of % Wazzala Natural and % Beriti Washed, then subsequently shift the blend % towards the Natural every few weeks.
Why should you try it? Because Ethiopian coffees are some of the best in the world! Also, most cafes serve static blends, which are comforting and consistent, but a progressive blend gives you insight into how blending ratios affect flavor, body, and more. Look for your favorite cafe to carry the entire series so you get to taste the experience! You can also order the series online. Don't have an espresso machine? That's okay! I highly recommend our Asymmetries blends in an immersion dripper, press pot, or other steeping methods.
What to know more about the coffees? Check them out here:
Beriti Washed      -  http://store.ceremonycoffee.com/coffees/beriti.html
                              Character - Crisp, juicy, medium body, silky, citrus
Wazzala Natural  -  http://store.ceremonycoffee.com/coffees/wazzala_natural.html
                              Character - Sweet, creamy, full body, berries & cherries
V, a % to % blend, leads heavy on the Bertiti Washed. Buy a bag here: http://store.ceremonycoffee.com/coffees/asymmetries_v.html 
To get your mouth watering, here's what you can expect to taste in V:
Fresh melon aromatics
Sweet chocolate and blackberry
in a crisp, juicy cup
You can see the Beriti asserting itself in V with the overall experience being on the crisp, juicy side. A hint of the Wazzala Natural sneaks in with the blackberry though! We think this version will make a beautiful espresso, Long Black, or Cortado. As the blend progresses toward the Natural, the body will get fuller, the taste fruitier, and the mouthfeel more mellow. This shift will take any milk drink and imbue it with the taste of berries and cream. I can't wait!
How did we extract V? I'm glad you asked! First thing, age that roast to at least one week off. I promise it'll taste so much more flavorful once the degassing begins to subside! If you are pulling shots in its second week off-roast, try a :. "Golden" brew ratio* in - seconds (no pre-infusion was used on our end) at a F set point. As the roast ages to week three, try tightening up your brew ratio to closer to :. and pulling for - seconds.

With the doors at our Baltimore cafe now open, it feels like a good time to take a breath and reflect on the process. Our team at Ceremony has spent thousands of hours over the past year planning the space, training new baristas, and testing culinary concepts, all to bring Charm City denizens the cafe they deserve!
A key cog in opening  Park has been one of Ceremony's newest hires, the manager of our Baltimore caf - Jared Cate. Let's get to know this fellow a little better.
MH Hi, Jared. It has been pretty cool to see the hard work you've put into the cafe. Were you just born this amazing? What's your story?
JC Being a military kid, I have lived in many places. If you go by where I was born: Stuttgart Germany. If you go by where my parents are from: Tampa, Florida. If you go by most recent home: Boulder, Colorado. If you go by longest time in a location: York, England. (Is that a long enough answer?)
MH Wow. You're quite the globe trekker. How did you get started with coffee?
JC In college, I started drinking espresso drinks at a local coffee shop, and quickly came to the realization that I couldnt afford them, so I got a job there for the employee discount.
MH That sounds strangely familiar! So you, like me, got in for the perks. What has kept you in the game?
JC There are two things that have kept me in coffee for this long: The opportunity to continue learning about amazing coffee by being around it all the time, and being able to be a part of a community - making a simple but significant difference in customers' days.
MH What a guy. We're on the same page again. Customer experience is number one. Going back to your first point though - what is your current favorite coffee and favorite coffee of all time?
JC I currently keep reaching for the Ethiopia Wazzala. The depth of flavor and complexity keeps it exciting every time. My favorite of all time is the first time I tried a naturally processed Ethiopian Harrar. While it may not be my current favorite, it's definitely one of the most memorable coffee experiences I have ever had.
MH I think many people, both in and out of coffee, would echo your sentiments about that naturally processed Ethiopian eureka moment. I experienced the same deal with a batch brew of Wondo in NYC! Ok, few more questions. What is your favorite coffee ritual? 
JC I dont know if I have a favorite ritual. One of the things I love about the coffee world is that it is so diverse. You can have coffee in different ways all the time and not ever get stuck in a rut.
MH Great point! It really takes effort to make coffee brewing boring with how the seeds and the ideal parameters are constantly changing. Thanks for taking the time answer these questions, so we can get to know you a little better. What is something people might not know about you from meeting you in the cafe?
JC I have  kids! So far, they all like coffee, and my oldest boy is starting to learn to pull shots on our home espresso machine!
MH So if we run into staffing problems, we don't have far to look for new applicants! As a family-man and resident of Baltimore, what do you plan on bringing to your community's newest caf?
JC I want to bring an eye opening coffee experience to the Mount Vernon neighborhood, and Baltimore in general; not only though the quality of the coffee, but through the quality of service as well. The coffee world can sometimes seem unapproachable to the uninitiated, so our goal is to portray specialty coffee in a way that isnt off-putting, and gets people at every level of coffee knowledge excited.
MH I couldn't agree more. Specialty coffee doesn't have to be scary or intimidating. Rather, as our bag says, "Coffee should be something special" and the right group of baristas can make that happen for the folks of Baltimore! We hope you, dear reader, can find a moment to check out our new spot at  Park, and please feel free to say hello to Jared! Until next time, happy brewing!

Top quality dissertation writing is not everyone's cup of tea. There are vital aspects that have to be considered, which are related to the writing of a perfect dissertation. For any topic that it may have been given, one needs to ensure that he or she gives it all the effort required so as to come up with a perfect final document.
Since a dissertation requires a lot of time and commitment, it will at times be hard to cope with the other details of the studies when writing the dissertation. This is the point where a person will need assistance in doing the writing so that he or she can be left with enough time to do the other academic activities. There are many dissertation writers nowadays, which is a reason why students should do a thorough research when they need professional services for writing dissertations.
Some of the dissertation writing services providers will merely collect and piece together data which is related to the topic a client has presented to them. This is a poor way of writing a dissertation and that is why a student should specifically go for the best writers. Professional writers will cover all the details included in your research paper. The data they include should be accurate and valid.
What makes the professional dissertation services stand out from the rest are the experienced and qualified staff members that they have employed. One way to ensure that the company you are hiring will be up to the task is the duration that it has been in business. If they have been writing dissertations and other academic work they should be well established and known. They are in the position of assisting a student to come up with a dissertation that meets the university guidelines to help one collect maximum points and an excellent grade eventually.
Your academic success is hinged on the quality of your dissertation. Do not let it derail your efforts of achieving a strong degree which will shape the life after graduation. Start searching now for the best writers. Start by checking the review pages on the websites of every dissertation writer that you are interested in. There are numerous positive comments here left by all the satisfied clients, and negatives reviews in case a client was not satisfied. That way, a client will be aware of what to expect from the writing company that he or she will hire.

These are only a few reasons to shop online at BestBuy.com; there are many more. Let's just say that if you're already looking at that famous yellow price tag, half the battle is done. Even if you just enjoy shopping in-store, there's no reason not to take a minute and check out BestBuy.com before you go. You never know what kind of great deals you'll find!

: Accessibility

You can shop all day, every day at BestBuy.com. You'll never have to worry about closed doors or last calls or rushing your shopping trip because you're anxious to get out of there on time. By shopping online, you have the freedom to browse at your leisure and only press "order" when you're well and truly ready. Unlike their outlet stores, BestBuy.com is never closed.

Another great thing about shopping online is that it can be done without interference. Even though they're helpful and knowledgeable, the staff at Best Buy still work on commission, which means they have an ulterior motive for offering any piece of advice. By shopping online, you'll avoid any well-meaning misdirection and only buy the products you really want.

: Deals

Uh oh, we mentioned the dreaded "B" word. But don't panic yet. Even if your cash if limited, you can still make a killing at Best Buy. That's because they have great deals that are only made sweeter with virtual purchase, like one-day and online-only sales and shopping codes that can only be entered with online checkout. They even offer free shipping on certain items! You also have the option of delivering things for store pickup, which is useful if your products need a special kind of handling or installation. The strapping men of Best Buy will handle everything you need where the internet drops off and the confusing cables begin.

: Variety

Another great thing about shopping online at Best Buy is the sheer variety of products you'll find there. Supply and demand means that stores typically only stock their most popular and best-selling items, so what if you're in the market for a satellite radio or a really rare DVD? You can take your chances at your local outlet... or you can use two clicks and find it virtually at BestBuy.com. There are literally hundreds of products for all kinds of electronic needs, so you're almost guaranteed to find what you're looking for, even if it's a rare or obscure piece of tech. The only limit is your budget!

: Specs

No matter how many items they manage to pack onto their shelves, Best Buy stores are still limited by physical space and the laws of matter. There are only so many products they can sell at one location because there simply isn't room for more. The solution? Offering absolutely everything at BestBuy.com. They have all the gadgets you need in every possible dimension, size and speed, perfect for finding that one fiddly piece for your laptop or getting exactly the right iPhone. If you're looking for a TV stand that will fit under your oddly-shaped window, BestBuy.com will offer the options their physical stores can't. If you want to debate the merits of a " HD monitor vs .", online is the place to do it.

In the small colony of Collasuyo in Caranavi region Nicolas Calque and his wife Maruja are doing a careful job at their process station. They have a farm called  La Florida in Collasuyo of  hectares where they produce and process their coffee. Nicolas started in coffee industry  years ago. His neighbors recognize him as a coffee lover and at the age of  Nicolas went to live with grandmother as his family were having economical problems. He started working as coffee picker, whilst his grandmother provided food and shelter. In  Nicolas invested all his savings and bought a farm in the colony of Collasuyo where he dedicated his entire farm to produce coffee, but the prices they were receiving for their product were too low to cover the family costs. In  Nicolas and his wife sold their farm and moved to Brazil to improve their quality of life. However, they soon changed their mind, It was not what I expected, I worked over  hour in a sewing plant, we lived with  families locked in a room in poor conditions. says Nicolas. Six months later Nicolas returned home to Collasuyo with his family and bought back the coffee farm in the farm from his savings. This has motivated Nicolas to produce more and tastier coffee. Hes a part of the program that Daniela and Pedro has, called Sol de Manana. Pedro and Daniela are exporting the coffee and finding a good market for it, they are also training the farmers to work for a higher quality with less leaf rust. This year Nicolas has planted two more hectares of coffee.

Caranavi, located  kilometres north of La Paz city, it has been noted as the centre of Bolivian coffee production. With the super rich soil combined with high altitudes, it has become the epicentre for coffee production in Bolivia.
Given the regions potential to produce unique exotic flavours it really is a hotbed for amazing coffee. Despite it s international recognition, Caranavi has neglected its coffee production. A mixture of ageing coffee plantations, reducing yields and leaf rust, combined with a high pressure towards coca cultivation has meant the coffee has been in decline. With coca being  times more profitable and with less growing issues, it has meant many producers have abandoned coffee production in favour of this lucrative crop. 
To try to save specialty coffee in Caranavi, our exporters Daniela and Pedro Roudriguez have started the project Sol de Manana. They have been sourcing coffee from small coffee producers in the region for three decades. However this steady decline of coffee production has not only put at risk the sustainability of there export business, but the future of coffee production in Bolivia is at risk of disappearing forever. 
They assumed the challenge of boosting the production and support the Bolivian coffee growing by the planting of new coffee plantations under a sustainable model based in three pillars.

Besides Caturra and Typica, they are here growing new exotic varieties to plant in its farms and implement new processes post-harvest.

This coffee is one of the four coffees were buying from Daniella and Pedro this year. This being the smaller lot we only have  kilos, a true nano lot.

In  we met up with our partner producers from Brazil at the Nordic Roasters Forum in Stockholm, Sweden.
Joao Hamilton, from Stio Cana and Felipe Croce from Fazenda Ambiental Fortaleza were invited to talk about how they approach working directly with roasters.

In January , we made a trip to Pittsfield, Massachusetts to visit the home of Chemex coffee makers.

Better late than never... We would like to share some video from our 
trip to Beneficio Don Mayo in Costa Rica. We sampled quite a few coffees
 last year from Costa Rica and Beneficio Don Mayo, particularly their 
Bella Vista farm cupped near the top.

We first want to thank Sebastian and Florian for working tirelessly on our new website. Thank You!  Since we opened in December of , we have been focusing on improving the quality of our coffee and cakes and as we explore the world of these two important dietary food-groups, we often come across a story worth telling.  Welcome to our new storybook for sharing our process!

Nario is located in the far south-west of Colombia bordering Ecuador, and is in general one of the most challenging, but also most interesting places to work. There is extremely high elevation, coffee up to  meters, very steep hillsides, and mainly super tiny producers in remote areas.
General production in Colombia is based on smallholders related to a cooperative or association. Nordic Approach is working with the Growers Association Cafe Occidente, who are currently attracting a lot of great farmers as they have established a cupping lab, and through buyers like us pay the premium back to the growers.

The area of Tarqui in the region of Huila is relatively unexplored for specialty coffee. Nordic Approach sourced this coffee and are predicting that we will find a lot of tasty coffee from this region in the future. This coffee from farmer Jaime Alzate placed third in the Nordic Approach quality competition that was held in December . One of the things that makes this coffee interesting is the fact that the parchment gets delivered in small quantities to the processing station almost every day, resulting in complete traceability and thus, better quality control.

The AeroPress is a coffee making system ideal for travel, or brewing a small amount at the home or office. It makes a very clean, sediment-free cup in a short period of time, and it is easy to clean up. You just need ground coffee, hot water, and a mug (ideally you brew directly into a mug, not included in the kit).
Brewing with the AeroPress gives good control over the variables - you can easily adjust the water temperature or water-to-coffee ratio to change the results. In my tests, the cup results match both the full pot Technivorm brews and my cupping results (the process where we mix grinds directly with water and use a spoon to taste many coffees at once.)
Here is an instructional video with more info on brewing with this!
A lot of our coffees are prepared quite nicely with this method. It does add a bit more body to the coffee than a v does.

We are happy to be working with Scott Rao to sell his books officially in Europe! It holds it own as the most concise, andthoroughbook on barista training available.
FROM THE AUTHOR: When I began in the coffee business fourteen years ago, I read every book I could find about coffee. After reading all of those books, however, I felt as if I hadn't learned much about how to make great coffee. My coffee library was chock-full of colorful descriptions of brewing styles, growing regions, and recipes, with a few almost-unreadable scientific books mixed in. I would have traded in all of those books for one serious, practical book with relevant information about making great coffee in a caf. Fourteen years later, I still haven't found that book. I know many other professionals as well as some obsessive nonprofessionals would like to find that same book I've been looking for. This book is my attempt to give it to them.

Five Elephant is a specialty coffee micro roastery, bakery and cafe in Berlin, Germany. Passionate about quality, our goal is to source the best coffees in the world in a way that is both socially and environmentally responsible.
We strive to involve our customers in a conversation about coffee and are committed to sourcing the green beans that we roast in the most direct way possible.
Transparency is at the core of our values and we think there should be a clear understanding of the journey that coffee takes from the farm to your cup. Through this openness we hope to create sustainable partnerships with farms from year to year.
We dont just visit our partners at origin, but work to understand their processes, from cultivation to preparation. We are committed to innovation and will never stop working to improve the coffee that we source and roast, including our relationship with the farmers who grow the coffee.
Our belief is that by opening up this coffee conversation, we can share some great coffee in a way we can be proud of.

Put your aeropress and cup on a scale. Bring filtered water to a boil. Thoroughly rinse paper filter to get rid of paper flavor.
Weigh out  grams of whole bean coffee. Grind the coffee a bit finer than filter drip (or use a grind that suits best for flavor and extraction).
Pull water off of the boil, and wait  seconds to a minute, or until the water is - degrees Fahrenheit. Start your timer, and quickly pour the water into the aeropress until it reaches  grams of water (near the top). Stir coffee.
Place plunger in just enough to seal the top, and keep coffee from dripping through.
 At  seconds, remove the plunger, and stir for five seconds. Place the plunger back on the aeropress to keep coffee from dripping through.
At  minute  seconds, remove plunger and stir for  seconds. Place the plunger and slowly push down for  seconds, until you hear a hissing sound. There should be moderate resistance. If it's very difficult to push down, your grind is too fine, if it's very easy, your grind is too coarse.
Make sure your coffee maker is clean and free of residue build up. Weigh out your coffee. A good ratio to start would be  grams (. ounces) of coffee to  liter (. ounces) of water.

	The climatic and geographical conditions of the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo are ideal to grow high quality coffee. However, infrastructure and trade have been in decline since the country gained its independence from Belgium in the s and were nearly destroyed in the years following the Rwandan genocide in .  Ongoing conflicts and violence caused many farmers to flee, abandoning their homes and coffee plantations. Producers who had nowhere else to go were forced to smuggle their coffee harvest out of the country to make a living.  Although the situation is still unstable, many farmers are looking for means to rebuild their lives again through agriculture. Fair Trade coffee, which has already proven a powerful conflict resolution tool in other unstable regions, has the potential to provide farmers and communities with sustainable livelihoods.
	
	Situated on the shores of Lake Kivu, SOPACDI (Solidarit Paysanne pour la Promotion des Actions Caf et Dveloppement Intgral) is one of few Congolese coffee cooperatives working with farmers affected by the regions constant struggles. With support from different organizations such as Twin Trading, SOPACDI has built its capacity to produce and export coffee to the highest of international standards. Due to the dire situation of coffee farmers in East Congo, Fair Trade officials took the initiative to allow SOPACDI to trade on Fair Trade terms on the basis of a documentary inspection, as the smoldering conflict in the region prevented FLO-CERT inspectors from traveling into the country. The cooperative became the first Fair Trade certified entity in Congo, with over , members of which an estimated  are women.

	Instead of the usual washed process, "Double Washed, otherwise known as the "Kenya Method", puts an additional process of moving the coffee into a special tank to soak for an additional -hours. The tank is filled with water and the coffee is allowed to soak. The tank is then emptied, and the process is repeated, filling the tank again and letting the coffee rest for - additional hours. After the second soak, the coffee is then moved to the drying patios. This process is done similarly in Kenya and parts of Ethiopia, but the technique varies from place to place.
	

What drew Klatch Coffee to Las Mercedes was great coffee, but what we fell in love with was the people, the process, and their passion to make the coffee so great. It begins with hand picking only ripe mature cherries, and then subjecting them to intense screening before depulping to eliminate twigs, leaves and other foreign material. At the wet mill the cherries are received into ceramic tiled ditches, washed with fresh collected rainwater from their own tanks and immediately fed into a pulper, which consists of rotating disks or cylinders, each one fitted with adjustable knives. These are designed to separate the bean from the flesh of the fruit while leaving each bean intact in its parchment envelope. They then dry the coffee on clay patios to ensure even drying.


	The same care and consideration invested in the coffee is invested into the Las Mercedes community. The Ortiz Family has always been devoted to taking care of those who have helped in their success, by providing clothing, food and health care. In addition, Las Mercedes is constantly making efforts to preserve natural wild life by taking special care of the disposal of by-products from the mill in order to avoid contamination also, in compliance with our certifications, chemical and pesticides are carefully store and managed by trained personnel, avoiding intoxication and contamination. In the last years, a great effort has been made in planting native trees to preserve these species.


	Finca Las Mercedes is a beautiful coffee farm with dedicated owners who care for their community, their workers, the environment and, nonetheless, seek to provided specialty coffee.  We are proud to offer this limited Direct Trade coffee that is also Rainforest Alliance Certified. As part of our Direct Trade contract,  cents of every pound is given back to fund community sports programs and Los Ortiz medical clinic. To read more about Los Ortiz medical clinic please visit

NOTES:  points by Coffee Review


	This is a "natural" processed decaffeinated coffee or otherwise known as the sugar cane method. Let us take you to Dorkville real quick to provide some insight one what this specific decaffeination process is and how it affects the overall flavor of the coffee. Basically there are four basic decaffeination process that we know of or have been introduced so far. They are the Direct Solvent, Indirect Solvent, Swiss Water and Co.  
	
	For this specific coffee, we're going to focus on the Solvent based process. Now don't freak out. Let us expand on what this process actually is. To simplify, this processes is when the caffeine is removed from the beans with the help of a chemical solvent, such as methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. Those solvent based processes in turn can be divided into methods using the direct method and the indirect method. 
	
	This specific coffee goes through the "indirect" process. What that mean is, instead of applying the solvent chemical directly onto the beans, the beans are soaked in near boiling water for several hours, which extracts the caffeine as well as other flavor elements and oils from the beans. The water is then separated and transferred to another tank where the beans are washed for about  hours with either methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. The molecules of the chemical solvent selectively bond with the molecules of caffeine and the resulting mixture is then heated to evaporate the solvent and caffeine.
	
	Lastly, the beans are reintroduced to the liquid to reabsorb most of the coffee oils and flavor elements.
However, because of the impracticality of gathering natural ethyl acetate and its cost, the chemical used for decaffeination appears to be synthetic. Ethyl acetate is produced commercially from ethyl alcohol and acetic acid, which in turn may be produced from natural ingredients or petroleum derivatives.
In the direct method caffeine is removed by soaking the materials directly in a solvent; the solvent is directly applied to the beans. 
	
	Las Serranias is graded "A" decaffeinated process that uses a derivative from sugar-cane known as Ethel Acetate (EA). The pleasing characteristic from the sugar cane adds to the sweet acidity and banana, apricot and cream notes. More importantly, It's not giving the dirty flavors most decaffeinated coffees are associated with. Overall, it's a well structured, smooth, and balanced coffee.
	
	Although Las Serranias is not a part of the Las Mingas Project directly, it was produce by the founders. Las Mingas Project promotes coffee relatinships, a partnership that brings producers, exporters, and roasters together to collaborate. Giving farmers bargaining power and receive honest pricing for trading practices. La Serrania came directly from Virmax, a premier exporter of Colombian Specialty Coffees that works under Direct Relationship model. 
	
	Without a doubt, decaf drinker or not, you will appreciate and adore Las Serranias. Kenneth Davids from Coffee Review scored Las Serranias  points and stated this decaf as "delicately rich and fruit-toned. In the aroma distinct cocoaish chocolate complicated by fresh-cut fir. In the cup soft, wine-like acidity, lightly syrupy mouthfeel, and continued fruit-inflected chocolate."

This specific area is located on the southern shores of Lake Toba, which is the largest volcanic lake in the world.  The soil around the southern part of the lake is volcanic which leads to exceptional terrain for growing coffee.  The town of Lintongnihuta sits on a plateau that ranges from  meters with a few farms over meters.  
	
	The producers of this coffee are small farmers who have been recognized by our staff to produce exceptional raw material.  These selected farmers run small two to four hectare plantations with each hectare consists of approximately , coffee trees. The farmer grows, harvests, and depulps the coffee on the farm.  After depulping he stores the coffee overnight, allowing it to ferment and washes the following day.  After washing the farmer will briefly dry the coffee to remove the moisture from the exterior of the parchment and delivers the coffee to our production facility.
	
	At this point the coffee is inspected to ensure that it surpasses our expectations.  If the coffees do not pass inspection, we will not purchase the shipment.  If the coffees meet our requirements, we will put into greenhouses for drying down to about % moisture.  At this point, the coffee will be hulled and then put back into the greenhouse for further drying.  
	
	After the coffee is dried to  to % moisture content in the greenhouses, the coffee will be delivered to the warehouse in Medan.  It is inspected and graded again upon arrival to ensure no errors were made during processing.  The coffee is then warehoused for  months.

Why youll love it: Generations of Americans have loved Colombian coffees for their balanced and smooth flavors. The San Roque is our interpretation of this classic and popular style, with exceptional sweetness and subtle flavors of citrus, grape, and cherry.
Story of the bean: Producers in the San Roque Association process and dry their own coffees and deliver them to quality analyst, Duver Rojas, who tastes the coffees delivered every day and pays incentives for the best coffees. Of  families in the association, this lot represents only ten producers who embraced these best practices. Their hard work on the steep hillsides unfolding below the San Roque Monastery and above the Magdalena River created this coffee of refined sweetness.

Why You'll Love It:This refined Colombian coffee displays rarely-tasted flavors of hibiscus and caramel-dipped apples.Story of The Bean: This coffee is the pride of Asociacion de Productores Agricolas de San Roque, a group of coffee producers that has set up an education system with a trained agronomist. Farmers receive classes on best growing practices, including planting the native Chachafruta tree which, in addition to having beautiful flowers, also fixes nitrogen in the soil and reduces the need for fertilizers. The Asociacion also works with a quality control analyst who tastes every delivery of coffee and grades it, then pays out price incentives for higher quality beans. Grown on steep hills in nutrient-rich volcanic soil, this extremely limited lot represents only the very best-tasting coffees from the San Roque producers.

Why you'll love it: One of our more darkly roasted single-origin coffees, this natural-processed Brazilian has the sweetness and nuttiness of a chocolate-caramel candy bar.
Story of the bean: In the s, coffee consumption was beginning to soar and Brazilian coffee producers struggled to find a coffee tree that could withstand the strong winds and rain in the tropical savannas south of the Amazon. The solution was a hybrid plant called Catuai, a highly productive dwarf variety prized for its sweetness. With rich chocolate flavor and a full body, the Blue Diamond is a shining example of a Brazilian Catuai.

Why Youll Love It: This balanced coffee has a toastedcoconutsweetness that stands out among other Brazilians.Story of The Bean: This coffee is called the Mahogany lot because it grows on the Fazenda Matilde farm under a canopy of beautiful Mahogany trees. The coffee and Mahogany are inter-cropped to provide shade for the coffee, bird habitats and erosion control. The trees are also a source of income for the farm, as Mahogany trees can be sold for wood after  years of growth.Our roaster visited the hillsides on this farm where this coffee is hand-picked, a rarity in Brazilian production. During tastings on the farm, he hand-selected this lot and we are excited to carry this unique Brazilian coffee for years to come.

Why You'll love it:The altitude of El Faldon coffee farm, and owner Arnulfo Leguizamos meticulous approach to picking and processing his beans, contributes to this coffees beautiful citrus notes and sugary finish.Story of The Bean:This roast both honors and elevates Colombias heirloom Caturra coffee variety, first introduced to the country in . Grown high in the mountains in the Huila region of Colombia, it consists of the ripest coffee cherries, carefully picked, fully washed, and dried in the sun. This processing causes the beans to take on bright flavors of passion fruit and lime, as well as a deep sweetness.
Colombian growers are called cafeteros and producer Arnulfo Leguizamo is a model cafetero in that he pays close attention to the quality and taste of his coffee. Four years ago, this Caturra won st place at the Colombian Cup of Excellence Competition, and Arnulfo used the winnings to take his family to see the ocean. Arnulfos work, this beautiful brew, represents Colombias famous coffee industry at its best."

Why you'll love it: Not only does this coffee taste delicious and refreshing when brewed hot or cold, it also represents a commitment to support and nurture the Haitian coffee industry.
Story of the bean: Farmers from the highest mountains of Southeastern Haiti overlooking the Caribbean grow coffee the way it has been done for two-hundred years - on small, family-owned farms alongside a diverse mix of shade trees, banana plants, and ground crops. Women cheerfully process and sort the coffee and load up the best grades for export on the colorful Tap Tap trucks to be delivered to the shipyards of Port Au Prince.
The resulting elegant, velvety-smooth coffee is a perfect example of what we mean by a culinary coffee and stands as a testimony to the abiding smallholder Haitian farmers with whom we are excited to have this historic partnership.
Take a look at our Scrapbook for more information about our efforts in Haiti.

How do I pick a coffee? Baffled about which coffee to pick? Take our Coffee Quiz! Or feel free to give us a call or email us (--- or help@lacolombe.net. Our Coffee Crew would love to help you find a coffee that suits your taste buds.  What are cupping notes? Does this mean your coffee is flavored? Our coffees do not contain added flavors. However, each of our single-origin coffees and blends has its own unique flavor. Those flavors and aromas come naturally from the coffee bean and can be affected by factors like country of origin, altitude, growing practices, processing techniques, and roasting styles. Coffees roasted more lightly have more of the characteristics unique to eachorigin, while those roasted on a darker level have more of the classic chocolatey and smoky tones found in our Classic and Reserve Blends.  The tasting notes that youll find on your bag of La Colombe coffee are what we taste when we brew and drink the coffee. By creating a simile between what were tasting in the coffee and familiar flavors weve had before (chocolate, apple pie, toasted marshmallow, etc.), its easier to communicate the often complex tastes that coffee can take on.  What grind should I choose? The choice of grind will depend on how you brew your coffee. Usually, we recommend ordering your coffee whole bean and grinding it fresh before you brew. But if you dont have a good-quality grinder, let us pre-grind it for you! We recommend the following grinds for specific brewing methods: Drip for regular automatic drip coffee machines Melitta/Chemex for pourovers Turkish a fine grind for Turkish coffee French Press a semi-coarse grind for immersion methods Home Espresso a fine grind for home espresso machines Commercial Espresso an even finer finer for commercial espresso machines Percolator a grind only to be used for a percolator coffee maker  Why does grind size matter? Read more here. What are your caf location and hours? Our national locations and hours can be found at our Cafs page here at this link.
What is the best way to store coffee? The best way to store coffee in an airtight container in a dark cupboard. Theres no need to freeze! Just keep your beans away from sunlight, air, and humidity.  How long is the shelf life? We recommend drinking your bagged coffee within  weeks of the roasting date. The coffee will not spoil after this date, but it will lose the amazing aromas and flavors we strive for in roasting.  Our cans of coffee remain fresh for about a year.  Our Pure Black cold-pressed bottled coffee has a shelf life of - weeks.  How do I brew coffee? There are infinite ways to brew coffee, and all coffee folks have their own strong opinions as to what makes the best cup. For our recommendations, check out our brewing tips video or our blog.  What is the difference between classics, reserves and single origins? What are seasonal single origins blends? At La Colombe, we have three different coffee lines. Classic Blends are our cornerstone blends that have been here since the very beginning. These are the coffees we drink on a daily basis, and if youre new to La Colombe, we recommend checking them out! Reserve Blends are modern and refined specialty blends take you on a journey of different flavors, all while remaining within the traditional coffee wheelhouse. Workshop Coffees are roasted in small batches and come from a single origin, usually a single farm or specific region of a country. Our seasonal Workshop blends are comprised of multiple unique, single-origin coffees.  How do I return a product I did not like? If you dont like a coffee weve sent you, no worries at all.

Here at La Colombe, we are keenly aware of where our coffee comes from, how it was grown, and, most importantly, the needs of the people involved in the coffees journey from seed to cup. We care deeply about the wellbeing of coffee-growing communities, and we strive to implement the best business practices to increase that wellbeing.
As one of the early pioneers of direct trade, we pride ourselves on proactive, longterm relationships with small-holder farms and socially responsible coffee-growing associations.

Today, SFMOMA is hosting aÂ Topping OutÂ event in Jesse Square park, where everyone can witness the highest beam lifted into placeÂ on their expanded building. Â Itâ€™s hard to believe that over a year has passed since the SFMOMA ground breaking ceremony, where we marked the occasion withÂ a site-specific cookie wall. Â  While we wonâ€™t be participating in todayâ€™s events, we wanted to share these photos taken on a shoot in July, commemorating a building that today reaches new heights, always deserving of a celebration, and happens to look great as a dessert.
Originally, we created thisÂ layered dessert, inspired byÂ Mario Bottaâ€™sÂ iconic striated turret, for a press eventÂ introducingÂ Snohettaâ€™s plansÂ for Â SFMOMAâ€™s expansion.Â  Alternating layers ofÂ black cocoa cake and whipped cream topped with a chocolate sable were diligently stacked in these perfect glass votives that Caitlin foundÂ on a whim.
We were adamantÂ about getting the dessert turret documented with the architectural turret it was inspired by. Â So we packed up the camera, a pint of whipping cream, and a whisk and headed downtown where we whipped the cream and assembled the dessert on site. Â Which happened to be outside at the fountain area just across the street from the museum we remember and love. Â And now whenever I pass it, I think of all the amazing art-inspired desserts we got to make within the building, and how much fun is yet to be had outside of it. Â Like whipping cream in situ.
Two of our favorite and most frequent visitors to the rooftop coffee bar were curators of Architecture and Design, Jennifer Dunlop Fletcher and Joseph Becker.Â  They would come up for their morning espresso drinks, sometimes again for a meeting in the afternoon and if the timing was right, I would poke my head out from the kitchen to say a quick hello and inquire about any creative endeavors.Â  In their open and generous manner, they would update us on what they were working on next or who they were meeting while they waited (never too long) for their drinks. In exchange, I would usually give them a taste of what we were working on. Â These brief exchanges would often turn into collaborations on a special event or a dessert. Â  On a tour with Jennifer through the Buckminster Fuller exhibition, as it was being installed, the creation of theÂ Buckminster Fuller Hot ChocolateÂ was finalized when we saw the magazine cover of the proposed floating village in a vitrine. Â 
It was always a treat to correspond with people who reply to emails with enthusiasm and in some case with thoughts they might have on art that would make a good dessert. Â Like these from Joseph:
Claes OldenburgÂ and Coosje van Bruggen, â€˜Dropped Coneâ€™ ()
and Le Corbusierâ€¦too architectural? But what about a chocolate meringue Ronchamp? Yum!
This time two years ago,Â Â Field ConditionsÂ opened.Â  This exhibition of â€œspatial experimentsâ€, included nearly  works by artists and architects, and entirelyÂ in black, white and shades of grey. Â Â For the opening event, the A+D department partnered with SFMOMAâ€™s education team who had scheduled a program in conjunction with the San Francisco Electronic Music Festival to celebrate John Cage.Â Â 
Field ConditionsÂ installation view, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, ; photo: Matthew Millman
We were already fans of Tauba Auerbachâ€™s work, from the  SECA exhibitionÂ which was up when we first opened the rooftop coffee bar, so it was no surprise that her â€œ/ Floorâ€ appealed to us.Â Â  The giant floor-tile installation, (coupled with a kinetic light installation by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer) is made of % black tiles and % white tiles, which are randomly distributed over the floor in aÂ QR codeâ€“like pattern.Â  Could we do a Mondrian-style cake that when cut into could be photographed with a QR code reader and take you to a website? We dreamed in black and white.Â 
Tauba Auerbach,Â / FloorÂ (detail) installed inÂ Field Conditions, ; Â photo: Rocor
As the installation of the / floor neared completion, we got word at the side kitchen door that there were a few square feet of the black and white tile left.Â  I asked Joseph if we could use it for the event to serve the series of black and white crackers we were working.Â  In minutes we had them in the kitchen and started working on some spreads for the crackers.Â  I acquired some squid ink from our friend Stuart atÂ State Bird ProvisionsÂ and waited for Tess, (a vegan whom I care for dearly and who, I was afraid would never come back to work if she had to witness squid ink in our sweet little production kitchen), to leave for the day before I attempted to color match our house-made ricotta to the black tile.
photo courtesy of Lanlian Szeto of SFMOMA, thankfully she took this, because itâ€™s the only documentation we have of the whole process/event!
Here, Tess Wilson and I are setting up what we like to affectionately call Taubaâ€™s â€œAuer-crack-ersâ€.Â  We set up black and white tiles that functioned as serving plates for the crackers buttermilkÂ (white) and black charcoal (black).Â  Guests were invited to choose their own spread (which we couldnâ€™t help ourselves refer to as grout) from a selection of housemade squid ink ricotta, white bean hummus, black sesame spread and whipped ricotta. Â Everyone was entertained at the thought that they were essentially â€œeating off the floorâ€ and delighted to get to take their tile home as a memento.
I just learned that today, August th , is National Dog Day! In lieu of bombarding you with videos of cute dogs eating cake, I thought this would be a perfect occasion to share some photos of the time we made dog biscuitsÂ for humans. Â  LastÂ January, the Roxie Theater screened Mike Millsâ€™  filmÂ Beginners as part of an event for SFMOMAâ€™s Live Projects series.As frequent SFMOMA collaborators, we set up a table at the front of the theatre to serve ticket holders New Orleanâ€™s Iced Coffee and bags of dog treats to eat at specific points throughout the film.Â 
The audience, fully caffeinated and captivated as they listen to director Mike Mills in conversation with SFMOMAâ€™s Gina Basso about the film and his recent commission forÂ Project Los Altos.
InÂ Beginners, Oliver (played by Ewan McGregor) inherits a Jack Russell, Arthur (played byÂ Cosmo), from his father after he dies.Â For those who havenâ€™t seen the film, Arthur has subtitles. This could be taken for him â€œtalking,â€ but Mills suggests that the dogâ€™s subtitles throughout the movie are â€œaÂ way to externalize a character who was sometimes non-verbal.â€ Â 
While we are huge Mike Mills fans, nothing gets our attention like aÂ cute dogÂ and the delight at what ensues when that cute dog â€œtalksâ€: Â the sound of  bags of cookies rustling at various points throughout a film. Â 
When Design*Sponge approached me about building a photo backdrop for their book release party, I instantly arranged a meeting (drinks at Locanda) with Leah Rosenberg, my dear friend, boss, and partner-in-cake-crime. Though Leahâ€™s an incredible painter, and I like to dabble in embroidery and flower-arranging, when we work together thereâ€™s generally baking involved. Leahâ€™s the head pastry chef for Blue Bottle Coffee in SFMOMAâ€™s Rooftop Sculpture Garden, and Iâ€™m her assistant, and weâ€™re happiest when weâ€™re working up there in our little 'xâ€™ kitchen. Our brainstorming session yielded quite a few excellent, edible ideas that we would need serious grant money to pull off, but our favorite reasonable one was the notion of a wall of cookies. The Glamorous Wall Of Cookiesâ€¦ Guests could have their picture taken, eat a cookie, and feel at peace with the world.
We went to work. I made a test batch of cookies just to play with sprinkles and such. I had the invaluable help of an enthusiastic -year-old, obviously a sprinkle & lustre-dust prodigy (she also took the photo).
Using theÂ random marker colorsÂ we had on hand, Leah & I did a (very, very rough) sketch of the cookie wall, to entice the Design*Sponge team. They liked it! The Glamorous Wall of Cookies was a go.
I created a game plan in an Excel document to keep us on track. I donâ€™t know if you can read my writing, but the only thing checked off is â€œMake a pointless Excel documentâ€.Â 
Next, I grabbed a piece of wood and a few nails from home and brought them to the tiny kitchen. We experimented with making holes in the cookies and hanging them from the wood, creating what I like to call The Hobo Wall Of Terror.Â  Donâ€™t be scared, itâ€™s all part of the process.
Now that we felt confident that it was possible to hang cookies on a wall, we crunched the numbers and got started making  cookies. Remember: 'xâ€™ kitchen. Our mixer can handle enough dough to make about  cookies, so we would be making  or  batches. As you can tell from her paintings and art cakes, Leah is incredibly skilled at creating and combining colors so she tinted her cookies confidently, but I still have so much to learn.
I tinted small amounts of dough at a time, scared I would ruin an entire batch.Â  This actually ended up working fine, as we were so inspired by Julia Rothmanâ€™s book tour illustrations. We wanted to capture all the subtle colors she used, as well as the d*s ribbons and the gorgeous book cover.
We punched holes in each one (we discovered that old-fashioned paper straws worked best).
And once all the cookies were baked, carefully layered them in Cambros, labeled with their quantity & (occasionally questionable) colors.
All the while, the task of building an actual wall (that could hold  cookies and wouldnâ€™t fall on people) loomed. We admitted weâ€™re really more cake-bakers than wall-builders, so we outsourced to our immensely talented friend Sam of Synth Island, who whipped up an elegant, sturdy design.Â  The three of us took a fieldtrip to Discount Builders, where every single person working helped us. They were all patient, efficient, friendly, and truly helpful.
Weâ€™d broughtÂ cookie â€œswatchesâ€ which we intended to share with all the employeesâ€¦.until I set them down in the wet color sample the nice paint boys whipped up for us. You see, itâ€™s not enough to see what the cookiesÂ look like nearby the paint color- they really need to be all up in it. From the beginning, Iâ€™d been envisioning colorful cookies on a gold background- gold to reference the book cover and to add plenty of glamour. Leah gently reminded me that no paint would create the true-gold background I dreamed of- for that, we would need to gold-leaf the wall (we would still love to do this, so please contact us if you need a gold-leafed wall full of possibly edible-gold-leafed cookies. It would be gorgeous..). Instead of settling for a trying-to-be-gold-but-really-yellow effect, Leah had the great idea of using the pretty grey of the Design*Sponge website. When I put the cookies in the paint, the colors really popped, so we were satisfied.
We found everything we needed, and loaded it up in a Zipcar (one ofÂ  vehicle rentals involved in this project- none of us have a car, and I donâ€™t even have a license).
The actual wall had to be built on the sidewalk in front of Samâ€™s apartment, as San Francisco apartments cannot accommodate very much lumber. Leah & I gridded out the holes for all of the nails (that took a few attempts), deciding to hang  cookies on each nail so the colors would change throughout the night of the party.Â I drilled, I broke the drillbit, she drilled, nailed, and painted, and I tried not to break anything else.Â  The day of the party arrived and Leah baked the hundreds of cookies in our little oven (referred to affectionately by guests as our Easy-Bake Oven). Our friend Kelly volunteered to be Leahâ€™s lovely cookie wall assistant at the party, since I would be out of town. Excitement was running high! We love Design*Sponge, we love baking, and we love outlandish projects- I hope everyone at the event had as much fun as we did making the cookie wall!
Here are some photos taken at the event at Anthropologie.Â  You can seeÂ  Blair Sneddonâ€™s photos of guests posing in front of the wall eating their cookies here!

Alejandro Cartagena, Fragmented Cities, Juarez #, from the series Suburbia Mexicana, Â  // Cartagena Ice Cream + Sorbet Trio // Â©Modern Art Desserts
We featured our Cartagena Ice Cream and Sorbet Trio in Modern Art Desserts, but didnâ€™t get to include the story (or picture) of when we fed Alejandro Cartagena (the artist, himself!) the trio of ice creams and sorbets. He and Pablo Lopez Luz, another artist featured in the Photography in Mexico exhibition, were in town for the opening celebration, and we were delighted to invite him up to try our finalized (just in time for the opening!) dessert.
Â Alejandro Cartagena and Pablo Lopez Luz eat some ice cream!
We learned earlier on that it is best to get a sense of an upcoming show ahead of time, to talk to curators as they are planning the exhibition, to get inside scoops from the museum install crew, to make the most successful rendition of a dessert based on an artwork.Â  Often, extra time was needed to get the approval of the artist, or to work out serving details, or to order ribbonâ€¦from Canada.Â 
But none of this mattered when I discovered one Wednesday night in April that Mary Heilmann was giving a lecture downstairs at the Wattis Theatre the following night.Â  Mary HeilmannÂ  is my favorite artist. I could go on about how her work got me through grad school, but best to cut to the part about cake.
I didnâ€™t sleep that night â€“ Mary Heilmannâ€™s paintings playing like a slide show through my head â€“ each one a possible dessert.Â  I thought about just going to the lecture, sitting on the edge of my seat and on her every word, but it would be a dream come true to meet her in person.Â  And if I met her in person, I would have to make her a dessert.Â  This is, afterall, why we were there doing what we did in the tiny kitchen at SFMOMA.Â  For moments like this. And this, and this, and even this. Â 
Mary Heilmann, Fire and Ice Remix/ sketch by Leah for Fire and Ice dessert
I had to carefully plan the following day, already packed with regular production, meetings and whatever else comes up in a day, in order to make something for Mary with the time and resources available. Â  Maybe all this sounds a bit crazy-making.Â  Or maybe, it sounds a bit like art-making.Â  Whatever it was, on April , , thanks to some fancy facilitating by SFMOMA Public Programs Associate, Gina Basso, I got to meet Mary and Mary got an impromptu dessert based on her painting Fire and Ice Remix.Â Â  This Red Hot Red Velvet Cake with crÃ¨me fraiche-spiked cream cheese frosting and buttermilk ice milk was made once and never again, what one might call an Artist Proof in the printmaking world,Â  I suppose.Â 
In the time between a tech run-through and her lecture, Gina brought Mary Heilmann up to the rooftop for a cake and ice cream remix of her Fire and Ice Remix.Â Â 
While the dessert might not have been perfect, it was eaten and now is gone.Â  Which thankfully, is not the case with the painting that inspired it. One week after her lecture, I received this sweet note in my inbox from Mary (herself!).Â  Even her emails turned to art.Â 
â€œLeah Â  Thank you Â again Â for the beautiful Â Fire and Ice Dessertâ€¦.. Â 
I even saved some and brought itÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  home to new york and ate it when I got home.Hey here it is I â€™ll never forget Â  Love Mary Hâ€
For years,Â Tony Cragg'sÂ Guglie was the first artwork we would see as we emerged from the elevator and out into the SFMOMA rooftop pavilion. Â For months, we had been thinking about building a striped frozen mousse using a cone shaped mold, but we had to be practical about time and freezer space. Â With theÂ Robert Frank showÂ about to come down (and thereforeÂ our float), another ice cream based treat to replace it was on our minds.

Sometimes the artwork would tell us what it needed to be and this time it begged us to be an ice cream cone.Â  In this case, the perfect flavor and hue of ice cream already existed, so it didnâ€™t take much to call up our friends atÂ Humphry SlocombeÂ to send over a couple of buckets of their Strawberry Sorbet (Salted Caramel replaced this in the winter) and Malted Milk Chocolate to match the sculpture. Our true work would lie then on creating a custom cone wrapper (and eventually, on the warm days, non stop ice cream scooping).
Here is Caitlinâ€™s first test.Â Turns out some extra math was required, as we needed the stripes to match up just right.
Where we would often find ourselves toiling away in the kitchen testing recipes, trying to get flavors and textures just right, this time we brought out the paint box to engineer a custom sleeve so we could transform what was once was a brown sugar waffle cone intoâ€¦ a Cragg cone!
BeforeÂ Modern Art DessertsÂ (the book) came along, a photographer from the SFMOMA had been the primary chronicler of our desserts.Â Charlie Villyard, member of the installation crew and talented photographer, would come up every few months and document all of the goodies we had been making. And one of our very favorite shots he ever took was this one of our Tony Cragg ice cream cone.
Here he is, doing whatever needs to be done to get the shot right. But quickly, before the ice cream melts!
Since the Cragg piece was installed in the pavilion and not the main galleries, it was one of the rare occasions in which you could eat the dessert you ordered rightÂ in next to the artwork that inspired it. Â An evenÂ rarer occasion was purposefully scooping ice cream directly onto the floor!
After a visit to SFMOMA from LA, a relative of mine gave me this.Â  He had saved his cone wrapper, collaged it onto a photograph he took of the Tony Cragg piece and put it in a frame.
Sometimes a sculpture inspires an ice cream cone.Â  Sometimes an ice cream cone inspires a collage.
You can see the Cragg Cone (in its upright state) and the recipe on page  ofÂ Modern Art Desserts. And in case you want to dress your cones this summer in stripes, we made a template that you canÂ downloadÂ here.
Today we celebrate National Ice Cream Day with a couple of art-inspired ice cream sandwiches! You can thank President Ronald Reagan, who in , designated the third Sunday in July as National Ice Cream Day.Â  Clearly exhibiting his good sense when it comes to sweets, he carried on to proclaim the entire month ofÂ  July as National Ice Cream Month.Â  In the proclamation, President Reagan (who also had an affinity for jelly beans!) called for all people of the United States to observe these events with â€œappropriate ceremonies and activities.â€

Caitlinâ€™s sketchbook detailing Joel Shapiro Ice Cream Sandwich recipe and flavors.
We designed this dessert- a layer of strawberry and then lavender ice cream sandwiched between two vanilla ice box cookies (one with a black stripe and the other with a yellow stripe) for theÂ   SFMOMA Art Auction.Â  When SFMOMA asked us to do a special something for the upcoming art auction,Â we explored a few ideas before settling on this ice cream treat based on Joel Shapiroâ€™s  Untitled pastel drawing.Â  Earlier on, we mocked up thoughts forÂ  Liz Larner chocolate dipped potato chips in which house-made potato chips would be dipped in a black cocoa-tobacco chocolate shell.Â  We considered a mondrian-style cake that reveals a colorful Mark Grotjahn burst.
The Joel Shapiro ice cream sandwich was a rendition of our Agnes Martin version we createdÂ  in  while her paintings were on view for the exhibition,Â Calder to Warhol,Â  introducing the Fisher Collection and celebrating the museumâ€™s th anniversary.Â  Subtle bands of cream, parchment and a glaze of creamy yellow inn Martinâ€™s painting Wheat were translated into delicious, quiet layers of rose mastic ice milk, chamomile ice cream contained between two buckwheat biscuits.Â 
Over the years, we created a few more art-inspired ice cream-focused treats, which can all be found with inspirational stories and recipes in the Modern Art Desserts book.Â  Hopefully there are enough of them to get you through to the end of this ice cream focused monthâ€¦ consider it your patriotic duty to enjoy them!
Not long ago, I mentioned baseball in a post and assured you it would be the only time you would catch me referencing sports.Â  Since then,Â  I have attended two Giants games at AT&T park and a few days after that listened to the Mets playing the Giants in the kitchen, while I was playing with cookie dough.Â 
At the stadium, watching the game live,Â  I had a bit of a hard time following the innings and strike outs, as I found myself more taken by the bountiful bouquets of cotton candy bouncing up and down the stairways across the stadium.Â  Or the way a vendor would hand a churro to a customer as if they were passing the baton in an Olympic relay.Â  The best , though, was the fellow, armed with a holster of whipped cream around his waist, who floated up and down our row suited with a back pack of hot chocolate.
Surely by now you are wondering where this is going or get to the part about baseball already.Â  Perhaps by now you are imagining Modern Art Desserts taking their Pop Art Corn to the bleachers? Or the Mondrian Cake served up alongside garlic fries and beer?Â Â  As these thoughts fleeted around between innings, so did the image of the late San Francisco artist, Jay DeFeo flying a Giants banner from the fire escape of her Fillmore Street apartment while â€œThe Roseâ€ (â€“) is removed via forklift.Â  Â 
The Jay DeFeo Trust posted this gem right as the Giants sweep the World Series in  and DeFeoâ€™s masterpiece was about to go on view at SFMOMA for her revelatory retrospective. During the exhibition walk through, one SFMOMA curator noted were DeFeo, an avid Giants fan, still with us today, you can bet she would have skipped the exhibition opening for the Giants homecoming parade.Â 
Although we have yet to make desserts (marshmallows!) based on baseball bases, we did create a dessert, our version of an Ile Flottante, based on one of DeFeoâ€™s works that we offered while it was on view at SFMOMA.Â 
The Illustrated History of the Universe is an oil painting featuring a deceptively simple white disc floating asymmetrically against an impasto grey ground. Its complexity lies in how the layered textures convey three-dimensionality.Â  I love that you can see the artistâ€™s handprint on the bottom left.Â 
So, although I canâ€™t give you a play-by-play of the nine innings of the Giants game I attended since my attention was drawn to other things, I can give you step-by-step instructions on how to knock this DeFeo dessert out of the park.Â  The photos that follow were all taken byÂ Willa Koerner - at SFMOMA (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art).
Step : beat powdered sugar with egg whites. //Â  Step : pile the sugar + egg mixture into a piping bag- and also fold caramelized cocoa nibs into fluff before loading the mixture into the piping bag- details, details!
Step : Pipe the meringues (an Ateco  tip is what we used).Â  // Step : Bake meringues at  degrees for  hour and let them cool in the oven overnight.
Step : Dip the meringues in (all organic) chocolate magic shell.
Step : Allow the shell to harden in a cool spot and remove from sheet tray.Â  Store in freezer until ready to serve.
Step :Â  Spread the the creamy base (which is a black sesame creme anglaise) like you are applying an impasto layer of paint to a canvas.
Step :Â  Float the meringue on the creme anglaise and sprinkle with charcoal sea salt.
Step :Â  Eat, enjoy!Â  And then maybe take yourself to a ball game.
When one thinks about art and tomato soup, Warholâ€™s screen prints of soup cans probably come to mind.
Here is Caitlin pointing them out when we were visting MOMA during our visit to New York last spring.
Warholâ€™s screen prints might also come to mind when one thinks about themes of seriality and repetition in art.Â  So too might Minimalist artist Donald Judd'sÂ  stack pieces that focus on â€œreal materials in real spaceâ€ and their purity of form.

Last year when his painting Untitled  was on view as part of the Permanent Collection exhibition on the th floor of SFMOMA, we made a minimalist soup in reference to the minimalist work.Â Â  Donald Juddâ€™s birthday was last week and I wanted to make this soup for the occasion and float a candle in it, but it has been outrageously warm here and it didnâ€™t seem right to post about a hot soup.Â  That said, word on the field is that Dirty Girl Farms just got their second wave of tomatoes in the ground this weekend that will be ready for harvest in August.Â  If you canâ€™t wait until then, or are eager to make this soup for someoneâ€™s birthday like we were, you could use the whole peeled tomatoes by Jovial.
The day we photographed this up on the SFMOMA rooftop last year, was a perfect day for soup.Â 
And while this soup does a lousy job at holding a birthday candle it really does look like Juddâ€™s Untitled!Â  Have a look for yourself!
Epilogue:Â  It occurred to me that Donald Judd and Andy Warhol have more in common than repetition in art.Â  They also have tomatoesâ€¦or would have had tomatoes in common had we actually gone through with this Bloody Mary Jell-o we were testing in response to this savory palette self portrait.Â 
This sketch by Caitlin is far more delicious than the Jell-o itself.Â  Trust us, eating paper would be more delicious than eating this particular Jell-o.Â  And although this is a place where we will share other failed attempts at creating edible artworks, this is the only time we will ever speak of this particular (and epically disgusting) Jell-o.

When designingour seasonal blend Telemetry, we look at our entire lineup of single origin coffees from that season, and think about the flavors each varietal is bringing to the table, and how they may work together to create a blend that is sweet, bright, and rounded in its flavors and character.
We've designed the component seriesto allow you to explore the construction of Telemetry. Each pack includes a oz bag of each Telemetry component, as well asa oz bag of Telemetry itself. Taste them separately, or together, and build your own understanding of how we structure our blends, and how unique flavors can work together to create something really special.

Forty years ago, a cup of coffee was nothing more than a caffeine delivery vehicle. It didn't really matter how it tasted, it just had to slap you awake in the morning or prop you up through a long afternoon. But in the last decade or so, things have changed. A lot. A few people scattered across the country discovered how amazing a cup of coffee can be when you source the beans directly from farmers you know. When you roast the beans yourself in such a way that nothing intrinsic to the coffee is removed. When you brew the coffee with down-to-the-second precision.
Ritual has been a pioneer in this delicious shift in coffee consciousness since we opened our doors on Valencia Street in  and started what some call a coffee revolution in San Francisco. Our goal then--and our goal now--is to craft the very best cup of coffee available anywhere. Period. We've learned a lot over the years, but the care and attention we lavish on our process is unchanged, including tasting every coffee several times before it goes out to our coffee bars and into your cup.
We don't do all of this to make coffee more complicated. We do it because pretty much everybody who works here has had a moment where a really, really good cup of coffee changed their lives.
From ancient Ethiopian highlands to your breakfast table, coffee is a global experience. This daily ritual is our inspiration to grow and challenge ourselves. With that in mind, weve created the Farmlevel Initiative, committed to ethics and excellence.
Before finding its home in your mug, Verve coffee passes through many hands. Farmers, Roasters, and Baristas all play an integral role in crafting the cup. The Farmlevel Initiative supports every hand that holds our coffee, from seed to cup, positively impacting communities at the local and global level. By connecting farmers at Farmlevel, with you, at Streetlevel, the Initiative creates an open line of communication that transcends distance, language, and culture.
The Farmlevel Initiative is vital to the future of coffee. At Farmlevel, it shows farmers that their work matters, their attention to detail is noticed, and that we support them every step of the way. It supports paying our farmers premiums for quality coffees through direct trade relationships. Our direct trade practice allows us to exceed Fair Trade minimums every time, no exceptions.
At Streetlevel, the Initiative lets you experience the most incredible coffees in the world, while knowing that youve positively impacted global communities with every sip. By purchasing a bag of Verve Coffee, you are committing to ethics and excellence.
Verve Coffee Roasters is an energetic and growing company with over  employees. The Company has become widely known for outstanding service, nationally recognized baristas, and for sourcing and roasting the world's finest coffees.

Stout and creamy with carmalized flavors of chicory root

Two hundred years before we started selling our coffee in San Francisco, the French brought coffee
infused with stout, carmalized flavors of chicory root to the shores of New Orleans. Blended with
creamy whole milk and organic cane sugar, our ready-to-drink, cold-brewed version pays homage
to that tradition in a sweet, nostalgic carton.

Our road trip-ready iced coffee is made of three simple ingredients: coffee, water, and time

Designed to inspire adventure and movement, our portable cans promise days on the trail, at
the beach, and camping with friends-in one adorable and sustainable package. The taste is luminous
yet dense, bright yet chocolatey, small yet powerful.

In the late s, the Turkish army swept across much of Eastern and Central Europe, arriving at Vienna in . Besieged and desperate, the Viennese needed an emissary who could pass through Turkish lines to get a message to the nearby Polish troops. Franz George Kolshitsky, who spoke Turkish and Arabic, took on the assignment disguised in a Turkish uniform. After many perilous close calls, Kolshitsky completed his valiant deed, returning to give the Viennese the news of the Poles imminent rescue of their city. On September , the Turks were repelled from Vienna, leaving everything they brought: camels, tents, honey, and strange bags of beans, which were thought to be camel feed. Kolshitsky, having lived in the Arab world for several years, knew these were bags of coffee. Using the money bestowed on him by the mayor of Vienna for his heroic deed, Kolshitsky bought the Turks coffee, opened Central Europes first coffee house (The Blue Bottle), and brought coffee to a grateful Vienna.

 years later, in Oakland, Calif., a slightly disaffected freelance musician and coffee lunatic, weary of the grande eggnog latte and the double skim pumpkin-pie macchiato, decided to open a roaster for people who were clamoring for the actual taste of freshly roasted coffee. Using a miniscule six-pound batch roaster, he made a historic vow: I will only sell coffee less than  hours out of the roaster to my customers, so they may enjoy coffee at its peak of flavor. I will only use the finest, most delicious and responsibly sourced beans. In honor of Kolshitskys heroics, he named his business Blue Bottle Coffee, and began another chapter in the history of superlative coffee.

Now, more than  years later and thanks to the enthusiastic support of many loyal customers, Blue Bottle Coffee has grown to a small network of cafes, an espresso cart, and some vintage German coffee roasters. We are still united by the simple purpose of getting great coffee to everyone who asks for it. Improbably and delightfully, there are hundreds of us now. We roast coffee on vintage gear, put it in compostable bags, and still get it to our customers within  hours. We roast great coffee in four cities, make great drinks, clean up after ourselves, bake cookies, type up invoices, get change at the bank, and say please and thank you. We offer the elderly and pregnant our seats on the bus and brush and floss daily. We look forward to seeing you soon.

Whether you are looking for an espresso grinder or a grinder to help you explore that extensive range of brew methods, the Encore is a great all around home grinder.
Over the years, the Maestro  has come to be lauded by coffee experts as THE go-to grinder for those who love both drip-coffee and manual brews. Building on that platform, Barazta has developed the Encore, with upgraded burrs to give a great grind for drip/manual brew and also fine enough for espresso. The Encore also has a completely new gearbox.

Featuring  individual grind settings, from fine to coarse, the Encore can please any palate with its gamut of accurate and repeatable grind settings. The Encore has an accurate medium to coarse grind for the increasingly popular manual brew methods such as pour-over, Aeropress, Siphon and Chemex. The specially designed burrs give a precise grind with minimal fines for a flavorful, balanced extraction when making espresso.

And, of course, the Encore is built with the quality Baratza parts youve come to trust. The efficient DC motor keeps your beans cool, even during extended grind times, while a combination of electric and gear speed reducers slow the burr to  RPM, ensuring a smooth bean feed and reducing noise, heat and static buildup.

Beyond a great coffee-drinking experience, the Encore makes for a great coffee-making experience. A convenient, front-mounted pulse button makes it easy to grind on demand into your brew basket. Whether you are looking for an espresso grinder or a grinder to help you explore that extensive range of brew methods, the Encore is a great all around home grinder.

Make your great grinder even better with Baratzas innovative Esatto, an accessory that can turn your Baratza grinder into a real time, weight-based grinding machine.

The Esatto is an accessory that is designed specifically for use with your Baratza Encore, Virtuoso, or Preciso.  With its easy assembly and simple operation, you will be grinding by weight in minutes. The Esatto was initially designed for use in a manual brew bar in a caf, eliminating the need to manually pre-weigh coffee beans.

The Esatto is a perfect way to showcase home brewing methods and equipment. Use the Esatto plus a Baratza grinder on the manual brew bar, and show your customer that they can purchase the grinder, brew method and coffee for use at home.
Digital Control Panel: The front-mounted control panel with LED display is easy and intuitive. Three programmable buttons allow the user to program in the desired weight (+/- .)  Simply press the START button, and the Esatto automatically delivers precise dosing.

Whether you are looking for an exceptional espresso grinder or a grinder to help you explore that extensive range of brew methods, the Preciso is the perfect grinder for you.
The Preciso is a beautifully designed conical burr coffee grinder that works as hard as you do to create the perfect espresso experience. It doesnt stop there of course; the Preciso has also received high marks from coffee experts as an exceptional grinder for the increasingly popular manual brew methods. The specially designed burrs give a precise grind with minimal fines for a flavorful, balanced extraction.

The Preciso is true to its name  a precision grinder with a micro-adjust system that can be dialed in like a commercial grinder. This, coupled with a coffee throughput that is  gram/second faster than other mm conical burr grinders, makes the Preciso exceptional for espresso. In addition to featuring Baratzas popular -grind adjustment options, the Preciso adds a second micro-adjustment level that further divides each of the  steps into  distinct settings. This means you have significantly more control over your espresso grind.

The Preciso features the quality internal parts and external elements youve come to expect from Baratza. It also comes equipped with our innovative PortaHolder, allowing you to grind your espresso hands-free, directly into the portafilter for quick setup and cleanup.

Great coffees balance sweetness, acidity and body to create the perfect cup of coffee. The Baratza Vario is a perfect example of a great grinder combining ease-of-use and a sleek appearance with a penchant for bringing out fantastic flavors in your beans.

This professional-grade grinder fits anywhere, from your kitchen to your office to your caf. While sporting a small footprint, the Vario features an impressive range of capabilities, boasting  distinct and repeatable grind settings from fine grind for espresso to course grind for press pot.

The design is beautiful as well as functional. Varios intuitive macro/micro adjustments make it easy to get the grind for a perfect espresso finish. Need something a little different? With a simple slide of the lever, you can switch from espresso to other coffee styles. And it couldnt be easier to get the perfect amount  digital timers and three user-programmable buttons make accurate one-touch dosing and repeatable grind times a snap.

The Varios unique mm ceramic flat burrs provide accurate, fast-grinding performance and remain sharp for twice as long as the best steel burrs. The high-torque DC motor and belt drive transmission mean your beans are in for a smooth, cool ride.

As always, its not just whats inside that matters; the Varios smooth operation carries over from internal to external, with front-mounted, easy-access control units, an  oz. grounds coffee collection bin, and Baratzas exclusive PortaHolder for hands-free grinding into an espresso machine portafilter.
Burrs: The Varios  mm professional ceramic flat burrs produce accurate grinding, high throughput and remain sharp for twice as long as the highest quality steel burrs. The Vario grinds . grams/second at Espresso and . grams/second at Press. The broad range of grind ( microns to  microns) and the narrow particle distribution (lack of fines) are the hallmarks of the superiority of the Vario burrs.
Digital Control Panel: The front mounted control panel with LED display is easy and intuitive. Three programmable buttons allow for grind time setting within . second (about . gram). Simply press the START button and the Vario automatically delivers precise dosing.
Grind Adjustment: The Vario offers macro and micro adjust for fine tuning with ease. The macro adjust moves from espresso to press pot in  distinct and repeatable settings. A secondary micro adjust arm further divides each of the  macro steps into  distinct settings. These steps enable you to dial in the exact grind for the perfect shot.
Grinds Left in Grinder: To maximize freshness, the Vario minimizes the ground coffee left in the grinder.
Brewing Methods: The Vario is exceptional for espresso and manual pour brewing methods.
Motor: A powerful, high torque DC motor effortlessly drives the burrs. This motor turns slowly resulting in cool, quiet operation and permits long grinding duty-cycles. The circuitry is equipped with an automatically resetting, thermal cutoff switch.
Calibration: The Vario is calibrated at the factory to ensure an accurate range of grind. If necessary, the Vario burrs can be easily calibrated using the special calibration tool that comes with the grinder.
Portaholder: The Vario comes with the Portaholder which permits hands-free grinding into an espresso portafilter and makes clean up a snap. The regular  oz. grounds bin is also included.
Cleaning: Burrs are easily removable with no tools, making cleaning very easy.
Hopper extender: An extension that can add  oz. of capacity to the existing  oz. bean hopper. Several extenders can be added to get to the capacity you need.

The Virtuoso lives up to its name by providing technical skill, classic style and a consistent, quality grind.
Grinding for espresso? Let the Virtuosos professional-grade mm conical burrs perform their magic for a consistent, fine grind. How about a French Press? The Virtuoso can handle that too, with a particle size uniformity that gives you consistency from cup to cup. In fact, the Virtuoso is so consistent at both the coarse and fine ends of the grind range that we consider it to be in a class all by itself  and so do many of the micro- and specialty-roasters who swear by it.

The secret to the Virtuosos consistent, smooth grind is two-fold: an efficient DC motor keeps your beans cool, even during extended grind times, while a combination of electric and gear speed reducers slow the burr to  RPM, ensuring a smooth bean feed and reducing noise, heat and static buildup.

The Virtuosos exterior is just as finely tuned as its interior  a convenient front-mounted pulse button allows for grinding directly into an espresso filter basket, while a -second timer means that its easy to replicate the ideal grind time. With the Virtuoso, the look goes beyond merely functional. A sculptured metal top and base give this grinder an expensive, elegant image that adds a sense of class and quality to kitchen counters and coffee shop workspaces alike.

When you want it all, the Virtuoso is the grinder that will get you there with function, elegance, and style.

The Bella is the wool sweater of our blends -- warm, comforting, familiar. Wild and citrusy organic African paired with earthy organic Indonesian makes for a vivid and fairly complex Moka/Java blend. It seems to weather the rigors of the automatic drip machine as well. This is, perhaps, why it's our most popular blend. It is also on the darker side: nice and thick without being inelegant. Bella stands up to milk or cream well, and is easily enjoyed black.

El Sombrero is an exceptional coffee coming from the southwest of Colombia. Grown at high elevation in a humid, topsy-turvy area of the Andes, coffees from the Huila District are typically known for their intensity and buttery red fruits. El Sombrero, however, which grows in the speck of a town called Suaza, takes on a completely different and more delicate profile, demonstrating how microclimate and individual producers can significantly alter a coffees character. The masterpiece of a handful of farmers and producers, El Sombreros ripe cherry is hand-turned in fermentation tanks before being dried in miniscule batches. The result is a distinctive and jubilant washed coffee reminiscent of a brisk herbal tea with sweetgrass and florals. Its vernal qualities may make you pause to consider the absolute versatility of one plant: its open structure allows notes of lemongrass, brown sugar, and marmalade to linger gingerly in the mouth for a pleasantly long while.

A blend of organic coffee that is quite dark and chocolaty. Maybe a bit more one-dimensional than the Bella Donovan, but it is a good dimension. Giant Steps is delightfully fudgy and thick in a French press or drip pot, and stands up to cream quite well. If it were any heavier-bodied, you could pour it on pancakes.

We developed this espresso over five years ago for the launch of our Kiosk on Linden Street. This is probably our darkest espresso: lower-toned, minimal brightness, plenty of chocolate  with an engaging complexity as a straight shot. The shots are gorgeous: achingly heavy with voluptuous red-brown crema, and the silky, somewhat dangerous-looking viscosity of a power-steering stop-leak product once used on our (now departed) heroically battered  Peugeot. In milk, it tastes like chocolate ovaltine, and holds its own from the daintiest oz Macchiato to our towering oz caffe latte. This is the most Brahmsian espresso we have. Brooding and autumnal, it is a coffee to mourn the passing of time.

Equal parts talent and luck, this Kenyan coffee hails from the southern slopes of Mt. Kenya, where conditions for coffee cultivation couldnt be finer. Add to this one of coffee's best accidentsthe diminutive peaberryand you have a resounding cup. Many believe that the naturally occurring peaberrywhere the coffee cherry produces one plump, round bean instead of two halvesdoubles the flavor and sugar of the seed and is easier to roast. Year after year, Kirinyaga coffees are beloved for their ripe, fruit-forward profiles. This one, grown by smallholder farmers and processed at the Kirinyaga Factory, does not disappoint. Whether its the fine soil, the high elevation, or the influence of the otherworldly peaberrythis coffee sparkles. Imagine verdant kiwi, with its star-like glitter of black seeds, crossed with the tropical notes of lemongrass.

Our New Orleans is a sweet and thick iced coffee, cold-brewed with roasted chicory, then cut with whole milk and organic cane sugar.
New Orleans-style iced coffee and chicory: There's been a certain amount of clamoring -- yes, clamoring! -- for a way to make our New Orleans-style Iced Coffee at home. So, here we are: a kit! We'll set you up with a pound of the coffee we use for our refreshing New Orleans-style Iced Coffee, an envelope of pre-measured, roasted French chicory, and a copy of the recipe we use -- scaled for one pound of coffee.

Whats in a name? Well, weve always been fans of the opascope, a beautiful tool for projecting handwriting and finely rendered artwork onto a larger surface. We could blab for hours about its quaint design, its bulky contours, its place in our childhood classrooms. But for expediencys sake, lets put it this way: The opascope is a tool for taking careful craftsmanship and opening it up for everyone to access and enjoy. Sound familiar? Available only in the Bay Area and online, the three-component Opascope Espresso is a refreshing addition to a lineup once dominated by dense, chocolatey selections. It yields an effervescent shot, packed with stripes of tropicalia.

What makes the Bushoki a paragon among Rwandas outstanding coffees? The landscape for one. Located in the north of the country, the Rulindo district is among the most mountainous in Rwanda, home to its tallest mountain, Mount Kabuye. Nestled amidst rolling hills, the Bushoki Washing Station sits in a shallow valley rich in groundwater. The ample water allows the station to process its Bourbon fruit in the style of a Kenyan coffee, where the cherry undergoes extensive scrubbing and pulping. The finer things in life tend to improve with age, and the Bushoki is no exception. When young, its explosively aromatic. As it settles, it does what Rwandan coffees do best: finds balance amidst contradictions. Where creaminess meets brightness, and ripe fruits marry with savory herbs, the silky, citric, and brisk Bushoki is a cup for the ages.

This coffee is generally a blend of Congolese and two different Ethiopians coffees. Together, these components produce a big, chocolaty aroma and excel in just about every prep method, save espresso and siphon. Unlike some of our fancy-shmancy single origins, this blend has a very easy-to-like personality, good body, unthreatening complexity, and a reasonably clean aftertaste. The coffeestwo Ethiopians, one dry-processed and one wet processed; and a wet-processed Congoleseleave subtle imprints of dried blueberries and cardamom. A fairly dark roast, this inclusive blend will take milk or cream well. Some say damn well.

The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of , popularly known as Proposition , is a California law intended to protect California citizens from chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm and to inform citizens about exposures to such chemicals. Â One such chemical is acrylamide, which may be present in coffee, including the coffee sold by Blue Bottle Coffee. Â Acrylamide is a naturally occurring byproduct formed when certain sugars and an amino acid react to high temperatures, such as when coffee is roasted. Â The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not determined that the low levels of acrylamide naturally found in roasted coffee have any public health impact. Your personal cancer risk is affected by a wide variety of factors. For more information on acrylamide, please consult the FDAs website at fda.gov.

The Bella is the wool sweater of our blends -- warm, comforting, familiar. Wild and citrusy organic African paired with earthy organic Indonesian makes for a vivid and fairly complex Moka/Java blend. It seems to weather the rigors of the automatic drip machine as well. This is, perhaps, why it's our most popular blend. It is also on the darker side: nice and thick without being inelegant. Bella stands up to milk or cream well, and is easily enjoyed black.

We developed this espresso over five years ago for the launch of our Kiosk on Linden Street. This is probably our darkest espresso: lower-toned, minimal brightness, plenty of chocolate  with an engaging complexity as a straight shot. The shots are gorgeous: achingly heavy with voluptuous red-brown crema, and the silky, somewhat dangerous-looking viscosity of a power-steering stop-leak product once used on our (now departed) heroically battered  Peugeot. In milk, it tastes like chocolate ovaltine, and holds its own from the daintiest oz Macchiato to our towering oz caffe latte. This is the most Brahmsian espresso we have. Brooding and autumnal, it is a coffee to mourn the passing of time.

We met MoisÃ©s Herrera and Marysabel Caballeroâ€”the couple that runs Finca El Puenteâ€”in . Since then, they have become like family and inspire us every year. From experimental coffee varieties and growing techniques to unique ways of processing, they push the boundaries of quality. This mostly Catuai-variety lot is lush with notes of Concord grape accented by a brown-sugar sweetness that finishes with a crisp, toasted nut character.
Recognizing Ugandaâ€™s incredible potential for quality, we worked with our partners at the Chema washing station to create some unique coffees. This lot was specially selected from the highest farms in the region and processed using underwater fermentationâ€”in place of their usual dry-fermentation methodâ€”to create a momentous coffee with bright notes of black cherry and cola with a creamy body.
Grown on the northwestern slopes of Mount Elgon in Uganda, this natural sundried coffee is the result of trial experiments and our collaboration with the Chema washing station. With flavors of grape candy, berries, and sweet spices, this special-preparation lot sourced from the Kabeywa community redefines what to expect from Ugandan coffee.
This coffee comes from the area of Calvas in southern Ecuador near the Peruvian border. Fifteen growers cultivated Typica and Caturra varieties on very-small organic farms to produce this single-community lot. Look for simple and sweet notes of chocolate and almond balanced by a creamy body.
In the western district of Nyamasheke, Rwandaonly a few kilometers from the beautiful Lake KivuJarama is an exciting new farm. Planted in  and , this -hectare farm, and the organization that manage it, are already receiving awards for their quality. Look for notes of raisin, brown sugar, and clementine.















The term Las Redes is Spanish for "the networks," and each group of farmers the Cenfrocafe Cooperative works with in Northern Peru has a different network name based on the micro-regions their coffees come from. This particular lot is a blend of a few micro-regions that we decaffeinated with an organic water processleaving intact buttery notes of cocoa powder, walnut, and plum.
We pay extra attention to decaf because we know people love it solely for its flavor. For Slow Motion, we start with great coffeeâ€”from the same farmers we work with for all of our coffeesâ€”and decaffeinate it in small batches using chemical-free water processing.



Uganda is not a country well known for specialty coffee. Farmers in the lush volcanic hills of Mount Elgon grow excellent SL- and SL- varieties at some of Africa's highest elevations, but, for years, poor processing has held them back. The Chema washing station is pioneering processing improvements at every step to bring us a refined coffee with savory notes of stone fruit and cocoa.

The OrgÃ¡nica cooperative in the region of Cauca, Colombia, has been creating coffee for our La Golondrina offering since .

This coffee is the result of the hard work of about two dozen small- and medium-sized family farms growing mainly Bourbon- and Typica-variety coffee in the small village of Bonta at approximately , meters. Small lots from these farms are processed and kept separate for us by the Colbran familyour long time partners in Papua New Guineato create a coffee that is savory, softly citric, and delicately tea-like.

Big Trouble offers nutty, caramel flavors people know and love, which may seem easyâ€”and our goal is to make it easy to enjoy in any brewerâ€”but it's actually one of the most challenging for us, because clean, sweet, low-acidity coffees from small-scale farms can be elusive.

We pay extra attention to decaf because we know people love it solely for its flavor. For Slow Motion, we start with great coffeeâ€”from the same farmers we work with for all of our coffeesâ€”and decaffeinate it in small batches using chemical-free water processing.
The Idido cooperative is located just east of the small, bustling town of Yirgacheffe, Ethiopia. Its membersâ€”situated throughout seven communities in the areaâ€”are growing some of the highest-altitude coffee in the region. We work closely with this organic cooperative year after year to select their best coffees, which are known for their sweet and delicate floral, melon, and citrus notes.
Recognizing Ugandaâ€™s incredible potential for quality, we worked with our partners at the Chema washing station to create some unique coffees. This lot was specially selected from the highest farms in the region and processed using underwater fermentationâ€”in place of their usual dry-fermentation methodâ€”to create a momentous coffee with bright notes of black cherry and cola with a creamy body.



We met MoisÃ©s Herrera and Marysabel Caballeroâ€”the couple that runs Finca El Puenteâ€”in . Since then, they have become like family and inspire us every year. From experimental coffee varieties and growing techniques to unique ways of processing, they push the boundaries of quality. This mostly Catuai-variety lot is lush with notes of Concord grape accented by a brown-sugar sweetness that finishes with a crisp, toasted nut character.

To start, Boka is a one-name kinda personlike Beyonce, Madonna, or Beck. And it seems quite fitting for a grower who is known in this area of the Eastern Highlands for growing great coffee. Boka grew up here and was childhood friends with Nichol Colbran of the Baroida Estate. In the s, Boka planted coffee under a government project that promoted growing coffee in the area. Under this project, Boka was able to plant coffee on about  hectares of land, and today his son Jack Boka manages many of the activities.
This single-farmer lot from Boka was made possible by the Colbran family who, this year, set up their washing station to keep coffee cherries from the communities of Kobuta and Bonta separate every day as it was delivered. By coincidence, on July  and , Boka was the only grower who delivered coffee cherries to the washing station, and, with this stroke of luckand careful notation by the Colbranswe were able to buy our first-ever single-farmer lot from the community of Bonta.
Eastern Highlands, Papua New Guinea
The coffee-growing region of Papua New Guinea's Eastern Highlands is one of the most remote places we travel to. The climate here, rich topsoil, elevation, and sometimes-unpredictable weather also make it one of the most unusual places for growing coffee. It is here in the rolling grasslandsbetween the village of Bonta and the Baroida estatethat Bokas farm is situated. Even though Bokas farm is considered a small estate in Papua New Guinea, he has about  hectares of land, which is fairly large compared to many small single growers we work with.

We first purchased coffees from PROCAFEQ association in , and we were stunned by how great the coffees were. Sadly, since then, the cooperative has struggled with a leaf rust epidemic that severely affected production. We have bought small lots of coffee over the last few years, but this year we are back to larger quantities of coffee from this great association. This particular lot showcases the best coffees from the area around the town of Calvas.
The origin of the name "Calvas" comes from the river of the same name that serves as a border with Peru.
Loja, Ecuador Coffee production in the Southern Highlands of Ecuador began in , and, throughout its history, coffee has been produced on small, roughly one-hectare farms by farmers committed to organic agriculture and environmental conservation.
Loja, within the Cuxibama Valley, is covered by over % hills and mountains. The coffee farms here are smallâ€“â€“most around a hectareâ€“â€“and the region exhibits diverse agroforestry systems, most notably the Podocarpus-El Condor Biosphere Reserve, considered one of the most-important sites for biodiversity in the world.

We met MoisÃ©s Herrera and Marysabel Caballeroâ€”the couple that runs Finca El Puenteâ€”in . Since then, they have become like family and inspire us every year. From experimental coffee varieties and growing techniques to unique ways of processing, they push the boundaries of quality. This mostly Catuai-variety lot is lush with notes of Concord grape accented by a brown-sugar sweetness that finishes with a crisp, toasted nut character.
Marysabel Caballero's maternal grandfather, Felipe GarcÃ­a, established the family's coffee farms and passed them down to his daughter, Sandra, who shares ownership with her husband, Fabio, and their children, Marysabel and Fabio Junior. The family divided their land into a number of parcels, assigning specific areas to individual family members who manage those areas independently. Finca El Puente, for example, is one of Marysabel's areas, which she owns and manages with her husband, MoisÃ©s Herrera, along with land that he brought to the marriage.
Originally from Guatemala, MoisÃ©s came to Honduras in the s for work with a Guatemalan coffee company, but he ended up buying some land of his own outside of Marcala and becoming a coffee grower before he met Marysabel. Together, they dedicated themselves to producing the highest-quality coffee they could, and, when they heard about the first coffee quality contests in Honduras, they naturally entered the coffee they had grown together. Right away, their coffee started to win prizes in these contests, and coffee from Finca El Puente began a winning streak that is unparalleled.
Today, Finca El Puente is one of the most-innovative farms in the world, growing exotic coffee varieties under unique conditions, testing experimental processing techniques, and generally pushing every aspect of coffee production to improve the coffee and the farm itself.
El Puente translates to the bridge in Spanish and is named so for a section of the farm that is close to a bridge that goes over a natural spring.
 Marcala, Honduras
Marcala is in the southern-Honduran region of La Paz, which is approximately an hour drive from the border with El Salvador. This high-elevation town is dry and dusty with more pine trees than one might expect in a tropical climate, but the Caballero-Herrera's farms are blessed with plentiful natural springs, and they have chosen to conserve a good deal of their land in order to protect this resource.

For over a decade Counter Culture has been focused on the Southern Region of Rwanda. Here we have  worked with cooperatives and other organizations, in particular Bufcafe, the owners of the Remera washing station. This year when we heard that Sam Muhirwa, who manages Remera was branching out and helping organizations in other areas of Rwanda with quality, developing specialized lots, and finding buyers for the coffee, we were intrigued.
Jarama itself comes from the Teuscher organization. Teuscher  bought approximately  hectares of land in the village of Gihombo in  and planted  separate farms there; Kamajumba, Nyaruzina, and Jarama. This lot that Counter Culture selected is exclusively from Jarama and is situated right above the Murundo washing station that this year processed all the coffee from Teuscher. The Murundo washing station also buys coffee from growers in the area. Selections from the washing station this year placed th and th in the Rwanda Cup of Excellence. Not too bad for a relatively new company, and farms in their second year of production.
Nyamasheke, Rwanda
The Nyamasheke district is situated in the rolling mountain landscape of Southwestern Rwanda.  Much of the area rests at the shores of the beautiful Lake Kivu across from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the district also encompasses areas of the Nyungwe Forest Preserve.  This areas high elevations have made it a place historically known for tea production, but it also in these high elevations that the region is also being recognized as having some of the best coffees in the entire country. 



Grown on the northwestern slopes of Mount Elgon in Uganda, this natural sundried coffee is the result of trial experiments and our collaboration with the Chema washing station. With flavors of grape candy, berries, and sweet spices, this special-preparation lot sourced from the Kabeywa community redefines what to expect from Ugandan coffee.
For years we have scoured the world looking for places to test and produce the great natural sundried coffees. Our experiments have included countries throughout Central America and recently have included projects in East Africa. Our natural sundried coffees from Rwanda and Burundi have been particularly impressive. To keep expanding our search, we started testing coffees in Uganda. Unlike Burundi and Rwanda, Uganda is already known for processing natural sundried coffees, but they are also known to produce some of the worst sundried coffee in the world. Often picked green and dried in the dirt, specialty buyers and producers in Uganda have avoided special-processed naturals.
This particular lot is the first natural coffee the Chema washing station has ever produced, and it is an entirely different natural sundried coffee from what Uganda is known for. This coffee was sourced solely from the high elevations of the Kabeywa community and was meticulously dried and sorted for us. The test batches of this coffee won a cupping competition in East Africa this year, and we are very happy with this first experimental natural sundried lot from Uganda.
Some of the highest-elevation coffee farms in the Kapchorwa district that deliver coffee cherries to the Chema washing station for processing are in a village called Kabeywa.
Kapchorwa, Uganda
Kapchorwa in eastern Uganda is home to a chain of volcanoesâ€”most notably Mount Elgon, which straddles the border between Kenya and Uganda. The soil is rich and the elevation is high, great for both coffee and other types of agricultural farming. It also rains a lot which keeps the climate relatively humid, especially given the altitude. The rain keeps the Sipi river flowing and creates three waterfalls, cascading from different spots on the river's course down Mount Elgon.
The Chema washing station sits between the first and the second waterfall and receives coffee cherries from farms , meters above sea level all the way up to , meters. The washing station provides centralized wet processing, as well as mechanical drying and some raised bed drying. Because of the heavy rains in the area, they built a custom retractable roof for their raised bed drying system, which protects the seeds from moisture damage. The station also processes cherry pulp for fertilizer, has an excellent waste-water treatment system, and provides farmer training and support.

Bolivia is a notoriously difficult place to buy and export high-quality coffeesâ€”with the biggest challenge being transporting coffee from farm to dry mill to ship in a timely fashion and at the right humidity level. Those who know and love Bolivian coffees from this region know of the challenges of trucking them from the mountains down the affectionately named "Death Road of Coroico" to the very-dry region of El Alto before being packed on ships in Peru to finally voyage to us.
We've purchased from the Cenaproc cooperative in Bolivia since , and each year we refine the process we use to get the best coffees. This year we introduced new standards for quality and strengthened our partnerships with the Cenaproc cooperative and a local cupping lab. This work helps with coffee selection and addressing issues early in the seasonâ€”setting the stage for better coffee and timely export.
Cenaproc was founded in  and is one of the most-recognized cooperatives in the region. Currently, the cooperative has approximately  members that come from three main areas close to their wet mill in Caranavi: Nueva Llusta, Nueva Canaan, and Libertador. Cenaproc competed and won awards in the Bolivian Cup of Excellence competition numerous times since .
The average amount of land in production for each producer is between  hectares. Most producers apply liquid and solid fertilizer that they create on their farms.
"Llusta" means "slippery" in Ayamara, the indigenous language spoken by a number of the producers of this coffee. The town bears this name because, during the rainy season, the earth turns to mud and becomes quite slippery. In addition, mud is a valued resource for the community, as many of the houses are constructed of bricks made from the hardened mud.
Nueva Llusta, Bolivia Nueva Llusta is located in the Yungas jungle in Boliviaâ€™s western mountains. Most coffee farmers in Bolivia are small scale with between one and eight hectares. Though this area has the perfect ingredients for quality coffee production, it has struggled for a while because of insufficient infrastructure. In the early s, the government began focusing more on enhancing the necessary infrastructure for success of their coffee market.
Agrarian land reform began in , but it was not until the 's and 's that land reform was a large part of Boliviaâ€™s national agenda. Agrarian families were then given title to land and encouraged to move back to rural areas to cultivate citrus and coffee. Since Evo Morales has been in power in the early s, he has continued to give land incentives to rural farmers, which have made coffee farming a more viable livelihood for individuals.
The producers in Nueva Llusta generally have a great amount of shade and often grow a variety of citrus and fruit trees in addition to their coffee production. They are also known for their success with processing the coffees on their own farms before taking the coffee to the dry mill.
Luis' family consists of four people: Luis, his wife, and two children. His farm is called "Finca Huayhua" after his last name because he puts so much effort into it. An expert in coffee farming and processing, Luis often shares his knowledge with nearby farmers, and his passion for excellence is not only contagious, but evident in his farm. Luis has approximately  hectares of property total, of which about . hectares are used for coffee cultivation. There are a number of shade trees on his property in addition to agricultural products consumed by his family. The farm's coffee trees are between - and -years-old.

This lot was specially selected from the highest farms in the region and processed using underwater fermentationâ€”in place of their usual dry-fermentation methodâ€”to create a momentous coffee with bright notes of black cherry and cola with a creamy body.
Uganda is a country with incredible potential for quality: They grow great botanical coffee varieties at high elevations, but, for years, poor processing held them back. All of that has been slowing changing as investments in washing stations and drying systems started popping up around the country. Drying is particularly tricky: Heavy rains, often during the harvest, make it difficult to properly dry coffeeâ€”washed or natural.
During our first visit to the Chema washing station, serving the greater Kapchorwa region, we calibrated on coffees, consulted on better drying practices, and committed to paying premiums for specificâ€”instead of generalâ€”lot separations. This may sound basic, but tweaking processing and setting aside more traceable lots requires a lot of work, especially for an operation that can process up to four tons an hour. In particular, Thomas (ECOM Agroindustrial's country manager) and Deus (head of quality control) worked hard to improve every step: from coffee cherry selection at buying stations, to implementing special processing methods, to longer drying times.

This coffee represents a blend of coffees from the Colbran family including Baroida, Kobuta, and Bonta. These late-harvest lots are remarkable because of major advancements in executing meticulous processing, which led to one of the biggest quality-improvements we have seen from any grower we have worked with. These coffees are remarkable because of increased attention paid to fermentation, better cupping and quality control standards in their lab, and drying to very-low final moisture content. The lots are below % moisture contentâ€”outside the normally accepted levels for drying coffee, which are typically closer to â€“% depending on country of origin. The Colbran familyâ€™s willingness to experiment and take risks for the sake of quality puts these coffees in their own class.
The Colbran family has gone from selling their coffee to larger commercial exporters, which would often blend their amazing coffee into large undistinguished lots, to having one of the most-recognized farms in the country for quality. This recognition is for good reason: The family's focus on traceability, lot selection, and refinement of processing can't be understated. This year represents our fourth year working with the Colbran family, and we couldn't be more grateful for and impressed by their dedication to producing the best coffee possible.
Eastern Highlands, Papua New Guinea
The coffee-growing region of Papua New Guinea's Eastern Highlands is one of the most-remote places we travel to. The climate, rich topsoil, elevation, and sometimes-unpredictable weather also make it one of the most unusual places for growing coffee. Much of the area where our coffees come from are rolling grasslands with coffee farms dotting the landscape. Farms here can range in size greatly, with some farmers having just a few hectares to larger producers with  hectares to Baroida, which has more than  hectares.
Baroida was founded by Ben Colbran and his wife, Norma, in the early s. At the time, the surrounding land was mostly grassland, and for the first two years Ben cultivated vegetables that he sold in the coastal town of Lae.
In , Ben followed the government's encouragement to plant coffee, which thrived in the micro-climate. Ben owned Baroida until , when he sold the land to a trust with Ben's son Nichol remaining onboard to manage it. Nichol managed the operation until , when he left to work on other projects. In , Nichol bought the land back, but, in the six years he was gone, the farm had fallen into disrepair. Fortunately, the Colbran family immediately started to turn things aroundâ€”while helping to create positive livelihoods for the local producers around the farm. In the last  years, Nichol's son Chris, along with his wife Melody and his brother Rhett, have also become integral to the operation. In addition to the Colbrans, now in their third generation on the farm, there are more than two dozen key employees with years of experience who make the coffee possible.

	Located in the NariÃ±o Department in southwest Colombia, Galeras is culled from micro-producers outside of the capitol, Pasto. All the farmers who contribute to Galeras grow coffee surrounding the active Volcan de Galeras, where it gleans its name. The climate here is dry and we believe that dryness, in combination with super-high elevations, accounts for the creation of some of the most complex coffees in Colombia.

	 is our first year working with this handful of producers in NariÃ±o who own, on average, less than  hectare of coffee â€” an extremely small amount. To build this offering we partnered with a cooperative to help us separate great tasting lots and to build this blend. Our hope is to develop this relationship and grow our Galeras offering year after year. The quality is stunning, yet the potential for improvements is even higher.

	Over the last decades, quality coffee production in Rwanda has advanced substantially. Since being decimated by civil war and strife, coffee has become a major export in Rwanda, where more than three-quarters of its citizens subsist through agriculture. Investment in infrastructure to process coffee and close work with growers has increased production of specialty coffee, work aided by non-profit and government funded programs, some of which was advised by professionals in specialty coffee. Kanzu the CooperativeÂ  has had the support of Technoserve, an organization that was also involved in Mutovu and Yukro. It certainly helps that Rwandaâ€™s terrain is very mountainous, with the high elevations, healthy ecosystems and nutrient rich soil beneficial to quality production.

	The Kanzu name refers both to the cooperative and the washing station. Kanzu rests in a valley betwixt mountain peaks near the shores of Lake Kivu. Founded in  with the aid of Technoserve, Kanzu brings together the coffee from hundreds of farmers who harvest fruit from trees cultivated on the mountains above and deliver ripe cherry for processing. Old-growth bourbon trees and terroir of the Nyamasheke region provide the backbone for this coffee with powerful character and acidity, while a  hour fermentation process adds complexity. After harvest and drying in March-July, this coffee then faces an epically long journey from land-locked Rwanda here to the USA.

	Lush, deeply fruited, and juicy, Kanzu is vivid, clear and clean. This marks our third consecutive season purchasing coffee from the Nyamasheke region. This dynamic coffee represents the potential for high-quality in Rwanda, and elsewhere in Africa where excellent terroir can be at odds with challenges in infrastructure and government which make uncovering coffees like Kanzu difficult. Weâ€™re very excited to offer this coffee for Winter and Spring.

	The Las Serranias is decaffeinated using the Natural Ethyl Acetate Method at the Descafecol plant in Manizales. Ethyl acetate is used as an extractor of the caffeine component of the coffee. Generally, this decaffeination process is performed using added chemicals. The ethyl acetate used in the Las Serranias, however, is obtained using fermented sugar cane (which naturally contains ethyl acetate), complementing the sweetness of the coffee. Rarely will one ever find a decaf coffee as sweet, complex, and enjoyable as the Las Serranias. Las Serranias is the exclusive decaf that is offered at Madcap as we are yet to find an option that comes close to comparing.

	Lucas Meloâ€™s farm, El Cairo, is situated high above the town of El Tambo in the NariÃ±o region of southwest Colombia, nearly flush with the equator. This location, warm breezes from the Pacific, soils rich in organic matter, and deep canyons where collected heat rises at night, make coffee production possible at very high altitudes, which is helpful in developing sweetness and acidity in the cup. Additionally, very consistent sun and rainfall ensure a steady growing environment.

	This terroir provides the habitat for a producer like Lucas Melo to nurture this stunning Caturra and Castillo coffee. To ensure a high-quality and tasty cup, he begins with diligent, selective picking followed by a detailed washing process that includes a -hour soak, followed by drying on plastic tarps outside his home. The resulting coffee sings with bright, clear fruit notes.

	As a multiple Cup of Excellence winning producer, Lucasâ€™ coffee is highly sought after. We are very fortunate to be one of his few regular buyers since our purchase of his nd Place CoE lot in .

	Since , Luis Reinosoâ€™s coffee has been a star in our lineup. That year we began to purchase coffee from Luis and his brother Didier. Luisâ€™ Colombian farm, Finca Vista Hermosa, or, â€œfarm with a beautiful viewâ€, rests at roughly  meters above sea level, looking out on a mix of cultivated coffee and natural forest.

	This high elevation provides the coffee trees with cool temperatures and a lower oxygen environment associated to coffees with fine, bright acidity. Indeed, we find lush fruit flavors of plums, cherries and citrus defining Luisâ€™ coffee as a filter or espresso brew. In cultivation are Caturra and Bourbon varieties, at a roughly - ratio, both of which are associated with lower-yield but high-quality cup characteristics. Having only two varieties is a risky choice &#

	Pepe and his son, also Pepe (who also has a son, you guessed it, named Pepe) got into coffee farming to give back to the earth what the earth had so kindly given to them. Pepe Mayor had the opportunity to see many parts of the world as he served as an ambassador of Ecuador in various countries over the years. Similarly, Pepe Menor traveled many parts of the world as a professional climber for a number of years, and he became the first Latin American to climb all the highest peaks in all  continents. After many years of traveling and spending time in nature, the father-son duo decided to start a coffee farm, rooted in the belief that their style of sustainable farming is one of the best ways to strengthen the ecosystem in their region.

	This special selection from the farm is made up of % Typica Mejorada, a Typica-like variety common in the area. The process of production is traditional, yet incredibly particular and detailed. Only â€œsangre de toroâ€ (dark red) cherries are picked and pulped before receiving natural-air fermentation and thorough washing and slow drying on raised beds in the mountains. The process is kept simple, yet regularly tested, refined, and explored to make sure only the cleanest and tastiest results are coming out of each lot.

	The family-owned operation started farming coffee under the name Cafe Instinto (coffee instinct) due to their core values, which are â€œpassion and instinct.â€ They strive to work in harmony with the land as much as possible and to test out many farming techniques to minimize their footprint on the land. The farm pays their workers some of the highest wages weâ€™ve seen and also offers competitive salaries and benefits to their full-time employees.

	With all of the diligence and care that goes into the process, the cost of production is quite high, but so is the quality of life and work environment on the farm. While the process places a heavy emphasis on quality, the real secret in producing such vibrant and unique coffee, according to Pepe Menor, is that the coffee is alive. The coffee experiences the passion of the family as every single seed is individually touched at at least one stage in the process. Each night the coffee listens to classic rock on vinyl (particularly Jimi Hendrix) as it is blasted from the system of their bamboo home located in the center of farm.

	Pepe and his son, also Pepe (who also has a son, you guessed it, named Pepe) got into coffee farming to give back to the earth what the earth had so kindly given to them.

Similarly, Pepe Menor traveled many parts of the world as a professional climber for a number of years, and he became the first Latin American to climb all the highest peaks in all  continents. After many years of traveling and spending time in nature, the father-son duo decided to start a coffee farm, rooted in the belief that their style of sustainable farming is one of the best ways to strengthen the ecosystem in their region.

	This special selection from the farm is made up of % Typica Mejorada, a Typica-like variety common in the area. The process of production is traditional, yet incredibly particular and detailed. Only â€œsangre de toroâ€ (dark red) cherries are picked and pulped before receiving natural-air fermentation and thorough washing and slow drying on raised beds in the mountains. The process is kept simple, yet regularly tested, refined, and explored to make sure only the cleanest and tastiest results are coming out of each lot.

	The family-owned operation started farming coffee under the name Cafe Instinto (coffee instinct) due to their core values, which are â€œpassion and instinct.â€ They strive to work in harmony with the land as much as possible and to test out many farming techniques to minimize their footprint on the land. The farm pays their workers some of the highest wages weâ€™ve seen and also offers competitive salaries and benefits to their full-time employees.

	With all of the diligence and care that goes into the process, the cost of production is quite high, but so is the quality of life and work environment on the farm. While the process places a heavy emphasis on quality, the real secret in producing such vibrant and unique coffee, according to Pepe Menor, is that the coffee is alive. The coffee experiences the passion of the family as every single seed is individually touched at at least one stage in the process. Each night the coffee listens to classic rock on vinyl (particularly Jimi Hendrix) as it is blasted from the system of their bamboo home located in the center of farm.

	The San Sebastian is a coffee showcasing the work of small shareholders in the municipality of La Plata in Huila. The coffee is produced by the Asociacion de Productores de Cafe de Alta Calidad del Occidente del Huila (OCCICAFE).Â  The profile found in this coffee is the result of piecing together around  exceptional lots to create a clean and sweet cup.Â  Nearly one thousand lots are cupped to build a lot of this size and quality. The growers involved in OCCICAFE all work side by side with quality analysis and are responsible for the harvesting, milling and drying of their coffee. La Plata is a small town of about , residents which was initially named San Sebastian de La Plata by early settlers. While La Plata has historically been known for silver, todayâ€™s economy is mostly agriculture. This season will mark the th harvest we have purchased from San Sebastian!

	In honor of our hometown area code here in Grand Rapids, we dubbed this blend Six One Six. Six One Six is enjoyable, trustworthy, and balanced: designed to be a delicious coffee that everyone can savor and trust everyday, much like the city itself. Embracing our commitment to seasonal changes in coffee harvests, the coffees in Six One Six change throughout the year, lending subtle flavor differences that keep this blend interesting.Â 

	The Spring Fling is a lively Madcap blend to celebrate the spring season. Itâ€™s full of life and new beginnings with sweet, delicate, and floral flavor.Â  This is another seasonal blend that carries our intention of stepping outside of the box to create an exotic experience made up of a couple of our finest fresh crop offerings.Â  Itâ€™s the perfect beverage to enjoy while flowers blossom and the birds start chirping.

	Embracing our dedication to excellent coffees, the Third Coast Espresso blend uses several of our best coffees in the course of the year to produce a luscious espresso: sweet, flavorful, and complex in its pure form, yet robust enough to support milk drinks. Careful observation throughout the year will yield the joy of tasting subtle, seasonal flavor changes. The Third Coast Espresso produces a rich texture, mixed berries, vibrant acidity and a balanced creamy body.

We believe so strongly in the power of super-fresh coffee that we only deliver to you weekly what you will drink in  to  days. If we sent you enough coffee for two weeks--or even worse an entire month--it would begin to lose it's vibrancy before you could finish half of it.

A sleek and simple daily pour over, the Bee House is a favorite around here for its ease of use, and clean, sweet cup character. Its a Japanese update on a classic paper cone brewer. Melitta Bentz invented the first version of this brewer in , using her sons blotting paper and a punctured brass pot. Today, you can find Melitta filters just about everywhere.
Measure g or (about  Tablespoons) of coffee beans. Grind them to medium fine or about as fine as table salt. 

Fold a Melitta # filter down the scalloped edges. Insert it into the Bee House Brewer and place it on top of your mug or pitcher. Pre-rinse the filter with hot water to rinse out the paper flavor and preheat your brewer and mug. Make sure to chuck this rinse water before you begin brewing. Add the ground coffee to the filter and zero out the scale.

Start the timer once you add hot water. Saturate the grounds, then give them a stir to break up the clumps. Coffee degasses or  blooms when its fresh  the coffee bed should rise up  and bubble up a bit. 

Pour the water evenly in a spiral over the coffee bed and slowly fill the brewer to the top. Pour over the dark spots and avoid the light ones as you bring the weight up to about g by :.

Once you hit :, your mug should be almost full (or you should have about  oz of brewed coffee). If there is still water in left in the brewer at this time, dont sweat it. Remove the dripper from atop the mug and place it in the sink. 

An iconic brewer with a timeless design invented in , the Chemex is easy to use and easy on the eyes. The Chemex is housed in the MOMA permanent design collection it also lives on most of our kitchen counters, too. It  brews a clean cup and maintains body and balanced floral notes.
Place the Chemex Filter in the brewer with single fold away from the spout and multiple folds lined up against the spout. Rinse the filter with hot water to get a nice even seal all the way around. This preheats the brewer and gets rid of any paper flavor from the filter. Dump the rinse water and fold the filter toward the spout to reinforce this area.
Add g or about  Tablespoons of coffee ground kind of like Kosher salt. Center the coffee in your brewer and zero out the scale.
Start the timer when you add the hot water. Pour until all the grounds are saturated or until you reach about g. Stir with a chopstick or spoon to make sure there are no dry clumps.
At :, start the second pour, making sure to reintegrate the coffee and water. Pour with a wiggling motion, then a gentle spiral until the volume reaches about a fingertip down from the top of the rim or g of water. Pour over the dark spots and avoid the light ones.
At :, fill the brewer flush to the top or about g of water.
At :, you should be pretty close to volume. Look at the glass bubble or belly button, which indicates  ounces. Lift the filter. Its okay to hover for a couple of seconds to make sure you have enough volume. Then pull the filter out completely and let it drain into the sink.
Swirl the Chemex around a little and youre ready to serve two cups of brewed coffee. 
Theres nothing better than cold brewed coffee on a hot summer day  or if youre like us, any day, really. Cold Brew coffee is naturally smooth and sweet and less acidic than coffee brewed with hot water. The Filtron Cold Water Brewer is a simple way to make several cups  of cold brew concentrate. Cold brewing takes between    hours (we recommend ) but the payoff is huge. This batch should keep you buzzing for days. We recommend a ratio of : coffee concentrate to water over ice, adjusting to taste.
Take the rubber stopper and plug the hole at the bottom of the coffee bowl.
Take the Filtron pad and fit it snugly in the bottom of the coffee bowl. It should be domed up in the center when its in place correctly.  If you are using it for the first time, give it a good rinse. When not using the pad, be sure to store it in cold water in the fridge.
Measure  ounces or  lb of coffee. Your coffee should be ground coarsely to  about the consistency of breadcrumbs. Pour it directly into the coffee bowl and  give it a shake to even out the coffee bed.
Place the coffee guard right on top of the coffee grounds. This will help the water distribute evenly and keep the coffee bed flat during brewing.
Add  ounces of cold water for  ounces ( lb) of coffee. Fill to the the  lb line inside the Filtron water bowl. If youre filling it over the sink, cover the hole at the bottom with your finger so the water doesnt drain out. Or, just add water directly to the water bowl.
After you pour the water in, let it brew for  to  hours. We recommend . Store it in your refrigerator.
After  hours, the concentrate should be ready. Use the handle of the coffee bowl and lift it above the empty  / liter decanter. Pull out the stopper slowly over the decanter and set it on top to drain. This should take about  to  minutes and will make several cups of concentrate.
Pour over ice. We suggest a ratio thats one part concentrate to two parts water. Adjust to your taste. The concentrate will keep in your refrigerator for about  days. Beware! Cold Brew coffee goes down smooth and easy, but packs a potent punch. Sip slowly, or add lots of ice, water, or milk to keep you from flying too close to the sun.
With its stainless steel and wavy contours, the Kalita Wave wins over coffee and design enthusiasts alike. Its a favorite pour over brew method for home use and its great on the go, too. The flat-bottom filter helps with even extraction while brewing.  The key to mastering this brewer is the slow spiral pour. 
Place and rinse the Kalita Wave filter in the dripper. This removes the paper flavor from the filter and warms everything up. Heat up your mug while youre at it.  

Discard the rinse water from the carafe or mug and grind g (about  Tablespoons) of coffee as fine as table salt. Add it to the filter, making sure the bed is completely flat. Place the Kalita Wave on top of a carafe or mug. Tare your scale to zero.

Saturate the dry grounds completely with g of hot water right off the boil (about F) in the first  seconds and allow it to bloom. Coffee degasses or blooms when its freshthe coffee bed should rise up and bubble a bit. Give the coffee a stir with a spoon. 

At :, pour water up to g in a spiral motion by :. The spiral motion helps give you an even extraction and keeps everything integrated.

Pour small amounts (-g of water) periodically to hit g by :. Submerging dark spots and avoiding light spots, slowly bring the water level to the top for an even extraction. 

Your brew volume should reach approximately ml or about to the top of a oz mug  at : to :. Remove the Wave from the carafe or mug and set it in the sink for the rest of the water to drain through. 

We start with the highest quality coffee, cold brew it without heat for over  hours, then use a double filtration process to procure the end result: a complex, smooth and full-bodied brew with low-acid and a chocolate finish. Feelings of invincibility and euphoria are likely toÂ follow.
You don't do dairy. Say no more. We've mixed our life-affirming Cold Brew with the finest coconut cream from Sumatra, Indonesia for a dairy-free, vegan game changer. Coconut Cold Brew is made with three natural ingredients so separation is bound to happen. For a good time, shake it like you mean it.
Our cascading and creamy Nitro Cold Brewis now available in a pop top. Pour it like you mean it into a glass or drink it straight from the source.
We bottled up our Original Cold Brew so its ready to go wherever you are. Enjoy straight out of the bottle or pour over ice. Cheers!

We work hard. We make lots of jokes. We cheers beers, ride bikes together, go to shows and trade dogsitting favors. We have tremendous amounts of respect for each other and for what we do. Stumptown is a family on an elemental level. Many of us are artists, musicians, creative types, and passionate types. It helps our coffee taste better and it makes our work lives richer.
And we drink the best office coffee on the planet.  
Some of us came because we were regulars. The baristas knew our drinks and were having a whole helluva lot more fun than the jobs we had. Some came because of the coffee. Some of us were home roasters, or worked for other coffee companies across the country. Came for a chance to work with the best green coffee in the world.
Some came because our best friends worked here. Most became best friends with our coworkers, because they also happened to be some of the best, most interesting people around.
We all came because we wanted to be here. A grip of us have been here for over a decade. Weve outgrown our first employee holiday dinners, squeezed in the backroom of a cozy Italian family restaurant in Southeast Portland. Weve leapt across the country. Went Dutch for a summer. But our holiday parties still rage.
We are passionate group of folks, some might even say obsessive. No matter which team were on, were sourcing, roasting, tasting, testing, practicing and pushing ourselves to do it better.

          We know we are the last link of a long chain, stretching across the earth, made up of hundreds of people and years of toil, soil and sweat to get this coffee into our hands. We take that responsibility very seriously. And we also have a lot of fun.

        Coffee is about pleasure. Itâ€™s that moment when your hand is warmed by the mug, you bring it up to your nose, inhale deeply and then take a sip.
      

        That sip is the culmination of years of work, three-thousand mile journeys, and passion. Here is how we make that sip perfect.
      

        While you are holding that cup of coffee, close your eyes. Open your mouth slightly. Breathe in deeply through your nose.
      

        You are smelling the most complex thing humans consume. When people talk about the flavors of coffee â€” notes of orange, or hints of clove â€” itâ€™s because those organic molecules are contained in the coffee bean. If a coffee reminds you of apple pie, it's because coffee shares some of the same components as food, like lactic and malic acid.
      

        Inside that small bean are the same natural components that make flowers smell so lovely, the same ethers that let you know when a piece of fruit is ripe. Coffee has twice as much going on, molecularly speaking, as red wine.
      

        When tasting coffee, try waiting for it to cool down a little â€” youâ€™ll be able to taste (and smell) the most when itâ€™s the same temperature as your body.
      

        Flavor only matters in the context of you. What do you like? What does this scent remind you of? Are you looking for a full-bodied cowboy co
        ffee, or a delicate, tea-like finish? Chocolate aromas, or hints of jasmine?

        Dont worry if you cant describe it precisely, or have a different perception than someone else. Even when you cant put it into words, youll know what you like.
      

        You experience the full flavors of the coffee bean if and only if nothing has gone wrong during
      

        Someone stands by that roaster, all day, a person who knows exactly how to bring the best out of every bean â€” that ideal ratio of sweetness to acidity, that balance â€” because he or she has been doing this for years.
      

        Again and again, they repeat the same motion: pull a tiny sample of the beans. Stare at them, looking for the tiny signs of perfection. Smell them deeply. Put them back. Pull out some more beans. Stare. Smell. Five seconds later, repeat the process in a meditation that last hours. Do that hundreds of times a day. Do that every day for years.
      

        Know every bean on a personal level. Adjust times and temperatures throughout the day, knowing that  seconds could make the difference between letting this bean shine and overwhelming it. Know that in the morning, the roaster is cold. Know that in the evening its hot, and you should probably shave  seconds off that roast.
      

        Roast just enough to bring out the best and full potential of whatâ€™s inherent in each particular coffee already. Roast to draw out things like acidity, floral notes, chocolate, molasses, and earth. All of the coffeeâ€™s flavor potentials are presented at the first crack â€“ an audible signal that happens at a particular point when roasting coffee. After that, roast just enough to add the right amount of body and sweetness, without degradation.
      

        Roasting different coffees as though theyre the same? Not going to work. Roasting for color, not taste? Never this.
      

        Please dont burn those beans. Theyve been through so much. Theyve come all the way across the world.
      

        The best coffee grows in the most remote places. There is a thin band that goes around the world near the equator. Within that band, you need mountains, thick old-growth forest and just the right microclimate. Set aside up to four days to get there.
      

        On your way there, youâ€™ll pass through Houstonâ€™s H.W. Bush Intercontinental Airport, or youâ€™ll stand in the endless security line at New Yorkâ€™s JFK en route to distant parts of Ethiopia, Colombia, Indonesia and  other countries around the world.
      

        Youâ€™ll also experience  vaccines (the malaria pillsâ€”which can cause hallucinations and nightmaresâ€”are the worst), a passport that fills up with handwritten visas, bumpy eight-hour van rides, granola bars and in at least one case, eating the heart of a bull that has been slaughtered in your honor.
      

        The Green Team members, named for the color of coffee beans before they are roasted, donâ€™t do it the easy way, which would be buying bulk, mid-quality beans at a trading floor in a capital city. Instead, they go right to the source of the best coffee â€” that farm or washing station high atop a distant Ethiopian hill. It ends when they arrive at that distant farm, washing station, factory or mill. They sit down in a home or around a campfire to talk about this yearâ€™s crop with a producer they have met many times. They get to work.
      

          In Colombia, if you go to four farms you will get four bowls of sancocho, which is this soup with chicken, yucca, plantains, potatoes, corn, avocado. Basically, its as many calories as you can cram in a bowl.
        

        The Green Team visits every producer as often as possible, sometimes up to three times per year. They constantly roast and taste the coffee, and they form long-term, lasting partnerships with the producers. Theyâ€™ll help them implement a new farming technique that could lead to even better coffee. Or theyâ€™ll teach a seminar on a new way to process coffee cherry, which is the fruit of the coffee tree surrounding the seed or bean.
      

        They routinely pay producers up to four times what they could get for their crop on the commodity market, but in return, they ask for a lot more workâ€”hand picking each cherry at ideal ripeness, or implementing a new piece of equipment.
      

        The Green Team also identifies potential future producersâ€”maybe this side of the mountain has just the right climate, but the quality level isnâ€™t there yet. Stumptown will invest in that farm, or mill, or factory if that producer is willing put forth effort to get the beans to the level the Green Team looks for. Itâ€™s a partnership, and there is prestige and pride involved. For a producer, selling to Stumptown means something.
      

        Above all, they want to help farms become sustainable and to set up strong businesses that build up their communities and produce the highest-quality coffee possible year after year.
      

          Our partners are much more than farmers, they are coffee production experts, constantly innovating practices in planting, harvesting and processing the best coffees around.
        

        We donâ€™t buy in bulk on a trading floor. We buy directly from the people who are making the coffee. Itâ€™s not a transaction; itâ€™s a partnership. If someone is growing the quality of coffee weâ€™re interested in, then we will help them in any way we can. That means regular visits (even though that trip can take up to four days), implementing new techniques and equipment, and forming long-term partnerships.
      

        We shoot for sustainability, and not just in the environmental sense. A sustainable coffee producer is someone who is paid fairly for their incredible work and who can in turn encourage others to follow in their footsteps. A sustainable producer innovates, develops and improves cultivation and in turn can fetch even higher prices from Stumptown. The more each side of the partnership puts in, the better the coffee gets.
      

        We dont call them farmers, we call them producers, which gives credit to the fact that they are production experts. They are the ones who make this coffee great. They are the ones who are like-minded, who will go the extra mile for quality, whatever that means.

          Producers are the heart of what makes great coffee.
        

          Their skills, expertise and craftsmanship is the difference between mediocre coffee and coffee that is like nothing youâ€™ve ever tasted before. The coffee will never get any better in quality once it lands in our hands, after all. We rely on the producers for that pristine bean. A good roaster works tirelessly to preserve that coffeeâ€™s inherent greatness.
        

          The producers grow the coffee trees. They pick the cherry when it is perfectly ripe. They remove the outer fruit, leaving just the bean covered in a thin parchment. They rest the beans, let the beans develop into their full selves.
        

          Everyone on this page does something slightly different â€” he may tend a small patch of coffee trees on the farm he inherited from his grandmother; she may oversee the cherry soaking in a big tank of water, fermenting at just the right rate.
        

          They live on four continents. They speak at least  different languages. Some use traditional methods that are centuries old; some have taken out four-year loans to get that new top-of-the-line piece of equipment that will lead to a greater, cleaner cup.
        

          Itâ€™s not the easy way. Itâ€™s not the fast way. Itâ€™s the right way, and it creates the best coffee possible.
        

        Coffee is a tree, and you probably prefer one branch to another, even if you don't know it yet.
      

        There isnt one kind of coffee, theres a coffee family tree. For hundreds of years, humans have been cultivating, hybridizing and perfecting it, and today there are hundreds of types, or varieties.
      

        The variety of coffee tree mattersâ€”or at least, it usually does. Just as different types of grapes yield different wines, the variety of th
        e bean can have a profound impact on the finished cup. &#

El Jordan is a group of farmers who have partnered together to educate each other and raise the overall level of quality possible from Colombias Tolima region
This small-farmers focused co-op grows and processes coffee from a handful of villages that make up the Bies Penantan community.
Renovations to the dry mill here have been completed, enabling the co-op to continue its meticulous processing. 
Ibu Rahmah is the Chairwoman for Ketiara which prides itself upon remaining a female led cooperative that redefines what Indonesian coffee can be. Although they live in a strictly Muslim region, theyve had the freedom to establish a co-op that is producing some of Stumptowns most singular coffee. They are a perfect example of the incredible quality possible from Sumatra. Besides coffee, they farm avocado, orange, banana, pepper, ginger, turmeric and more. 
Indonesias Takengon and Bener Meriah districts are known for sometimes producing cloudy, muddy coffees with too much body. However, the beans produced by the Ketiara Cooperative have stunned us with their round, soft profiles. Although they use some very old-school techniques that are unique to Indonesia, they have struck the perfect balance between old and new.
This group of farmers came together in . Their incredible attention to detail, including soil quality and a painstaking wet-hulling process, allows the earthy funkiness of Indonesian coffee to live in a clean cup. Part of this process includes the removal of the parchment  the thin layer around the coffee bean   much earlier than our other producers.
Bies Penantan consists of coffee cultivated by farmers within the Bies Penantan community. Previously, Bies Penantan was considered one village, but now a handful of villages make up the Bies Penantan community. 
In ,  people established the Ketiara Cooperative. They restructured their cooperative two years later to focus on small farmers. Ibu Rahmah is the Chairwoman for Ketiara which prides itself upon remaining a cooperative led by women. Over  producers contributed to the lot, some of whom are ethnic Javanese women who became widowed and displaced after the civil war. They plant their coffee under Lamtoro trees integrated with their other staple crops. The entire membership of Ketiara splits evenly between Gayonese and Javanese.
The Ketiara Co-op understands the importance of preparing the land, cultivating seedlings, and pruning. After the harvest, farmers transport the cherry to be depulped, fermented and then the parchment covered beans are dried in the sun to about % moisture content. After they remove the parchment by hulling the beans (known as wet-hulling since the parchment retains so much moisture), the still wet beans are then dried in the sun for a second time (to about % moisture content). They then use a Sutton machine to sort the beans. Finally, they dry the beans one last time, hand sort the coffee for quality assurance, then pack it up for export.
In , Ketiara obtained Organic certification for the farmers in the Bies Penantan community. They renovated their entire mill and updated some of their processing equipment. They purchased new sorting equipment which improved the quality of the Bies Penantan lot. Their efforts produced a beautiful example of Sumatran coffee at its best.

Decaf shouldnt taste this good. But it does. In fact, it tastes great.
The sweetness of raisins pairs beautifully with caramel in this creamy, buttery cup.

We begin with meticulously sourced beans, choosing only those whose flavors and profiles can stand up to decaffeination. We make that process as gentle as possible with the Swiss Water Decaf process. Pioneered in the s, this is the only certifiably organic way to remove caffeine. This process instead relies on hot water, osmosis, and an activated charcoal filter.
The result is a decaffeinated bean that still carries its own flavors and aromas; our blend brings a lightly sweet but full-bodied experience, and makes an outstanding espresso or cup of drip.

The BigStep refers to the design of the larger diameter 'stepped edge' measuring in at .mm (+/-.mm). This increases the surface area of extractable coffee to be covered, including the prevention of a pinched edge of coffee grind that can occur when using such a large (or incorrectly) sized base.

This base is made from an extremely high strength (min  Rockwell)  Grade Stainless steel in Australia from premium grade materials. For Pullman's Barista Tamp devotees, the BigStep retains the feel of a regular Barista base and is designed with those in mind who perform a standard tamping technique.

							Ripe cherries are hand picked by local pickers. The pickers are paid extra to sort ripe cherries from the unripe while they are picking. Sorting is done by simply putting the cherries in separate bags.
After de-pulping the mucilage is removed with the use of a penagos aqua pulper. Then the parchment is fermented for  hours before it is washed using african washing techniques which helps sorting floaters and undeveloped beans from the denser and more developed coffee. After washing, the beans are soaked for about  hours in running clean water. Then the coffee gets dried slowly on raised beds covered with shade nets.						
We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our light roasted coffees are suited for all brew methods except espresso. The roast level gives a cup with clarity, brightness and sweetness with little  bitterness and ashy flavors from the roast process.

If brewed as espresso on an espresso machine, the lighter roast style will result in a cup with a very high level of acidity due to the highly concentrated brew. We therefore recommend using our slightly darker roasted coffees for making espresso.
All our coffees are packed in vacuum sealed, recyclable plastic bags that are flushed with nitrogen before seal- ing. The bags has a one way valve to let the coffee de-gas while quality is kept in the sealed bag.

When the coffee is roasted it develops a lot of CO gas inside the beans. This gas will make the coffee taste smokey and ashy immediately after roasting. It is abso- lutely crucial to let the coffee degas and rest for a while before use to ensure maximum flavour.

We recommend storing / degassing our ligher roasted coffees for minimum  to  days after the date of roast , sealed in the original bag at room temperature, before you use it.

Make sure you store it in a dark place at around C - C, away from any heat, moisture or light. The coffee has lost most of its sweetness and aroma - weeks after the day of roast, so make sure you use it before it is too late.

You can find the roast date and batch number on all our coffees in the bottom right corner of the front label on the bags. 
We strongly recommend to use correct measurments and brewing techniques when you brew our coffees. Use a digital scale both to measure water and coffee in order to get consistent results.

We recommend to use between  to  grams of coffee per litre (g) of water, depending on the brewing method, water quality and coffee used. 




                      
                    

Â We have been part of developing the Oslo cup series from Figgjo together with designer Kristin HÃ¦rnes Ihlen from Physical Design and Figgjo. Therte are three different cups in the series. All made to enhance the drinking experience.

Â We have been part of developing the Oslo cup series from Figgjo together with designer Kristin HÃ¦rnes Ihlen from Physical Design and Figgjo. Therte are three different cups in the series. All made to enhance the drinking experience:
"Tulipan" (Tulip) is designed for coffees with lower acidity like typical Bourbons from El Salvador, Brazil or Indian coffees. The cone shaped cup enhances more earthy aromas and gives you an impression that the coffee is very sweet as the liquid enters the mouth in a narrow stream and hits the middle of the tongue.
"Splitt" is designed for coffees with intense fruity and floral aromas and bright acidity. Typically we use these cups for our Kenyan and Ethiopian coffees. The unique design enhances the aromatics when you smell the coffee in the cup and the wide shape makes the liquid enter your mouth with a wider spread so that you percieve acidity more clearly.
 "Ã…pen" (open) is more of an allround cup. The classic U-shape is a forgiving shape when it comes to taste balance yet it has the ability to intensify aromas when you smell the coffees. We typically use these cups for coffees that has fruity characters and medium intense acidity.Â 
The fun part is that you can play around with the different shapes with different coffees and change your guests perception of how the coffees taste like.




                      
                    
Our goal is to be among the best coffee roasters and espresso bars in the world and to be a preferred source for quality coffee, knowledge and innovation.

Like always we want to be as transparent as possible and show you that there is a reason why our coffees cost a bit more. In the photo above you can see all the prices we paid for our coffee in . The prices are per pound (lb=g) og green coffee Free on Board (FOB), which means the price...




                      
                    

							The coffee is selectively hand picked by hired pickers under
supervision of Elias. Cherries are hand sorted before they are
processed to make sure only ripe cherries are processed together.
After depulping the parchment coffee is rinsed in clean water.
Then the water is drained and the parchment is fermented for
 to  hours. After fermentation the coffee is washed in clean
water that is changed  times. All oaters are removed during
the washing. The Parchment is soaked for  hours in clean
water before it is dried in parabolic dryers under shade from  -  days.						
We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our espresso roasts are similar to our light roasts but are developed slightly more in order to reduce the intensity of acidity when brewed as espresso. This roast will give you slightly more bitter notes when brewed as a filter coffee. 
We strongly recommend to use VST filterbaskets. Both the g, g and the g basket is great for our coffee.

The VST filters makes it a lot easier to extract the espresso properly which gives a lot more sweetness in the cup. They are also more or less identical to eachother which makes it easy to be more consistent when brewing on several groups at the same time.
You can buy the filters here. Just make sure they fit your machine. (Fits all La Marzocco machines and machines with mm filter baskets)

With the VST  gram filterbasket, we recommend the following brewing parameters:

   grams freshly ground coffee
   seconds brewing time
   grams of final brew liquid in the cup
C  C brew water temperature

							The coffee is hand picked by the farmers and their families. After delivering the coffee to the wet mill the good coffee cherries are separated from the inferior ones. The cherries are depulped and graded by using an old disc de-pulper that uses water and gravity to sort dense beans from less dense beans. The beans are dry fermented for about - hours over night in one tank, then transported to a second tank with water where the fermentation is finished. This prevents the coffee from over fermenting. After fermentation the coffee is washed and graded in the evening before it gets soaked over night for about  hours. After soaking the coffee is dried on african elevated drying tables, where defect parchment coffee gets sorted out. The coffee is dried to a moisture between -% and stored in conditioning bins before delivery to the dry mill.						
We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our light roasted coffees are suited for all brew methods except espresso. The roast level gives a cup with clarity, brightness and sweetness with little  bitterness and ashy flavors from the roast process.

If brewed as espresso on an espresso machine, the lighter roast style will result in a cup with a very high level of acidity due to the highly concentrated brew. We therefore recommend using our slightly darker roasted coffees for making espresso.
All our coffees are packed in vacuum sealed, recyclable plastic bags that are flushed with nitrogen before seal- ing. The bags has a one way valve to let the coffee de-gas while quality is kept in the sealed bag.

When the coffee is roasted it develops a lot of CO gas inside the beans. This gas will make the coffee taste smokey and ashy immediately after roasting. It is abso- lutely crucial to let the coffee degas and rest for a while before use to ensure maximum flavour.

We recommend storing / degassing our ligher roasted coffees for minimum  to  days after the date of roast , sealed in the original bag at room temperature, before you use it.

Make sure you store it in a dark place at around C - C, away from any heat, moisture or light. The coffee has lost most of its sweetness and aroma - weeks after the day of roast, so make sure you use it before it is too late.

Tobyâ€™s Estate espresso roast is for espresso machines, stovetop and  plunger. Strong and flavourful with  milk and complex and refined as a black.


Roasters Notes:Â This one continues to delight us all.  For the uninitiated, monsooning is a kind of curing or aging that produces huge, bold, punchy coffees with very low acidity.  Unfortunately, monsooning is a tricky process and can easily produce coffee with unpleasant musty or hessian-y taints, or, if the acidity is completely eliminated, can produce a coffee that just seems dead and flat in the cup.Our Aspinwall is the only IMM weve found that is consistently clean and as close to delicate as a monsooned coffee can get, with maple syrup and spice notes and that light-but-not-imperceptible acidity to lift it up. And then, of course, down below is that gigantic, velvety body that punches through milk and doesnt even mind a bit of sugar. Incongruous and mesmerising, like watching a hippo dance ballet.

Roasters Notes:Â A classic Kenyan with a little extra punch, Malimbe is rich and big-bodied, with aromas of orange peel and bourbon along with a long, cocoa finish. Big enough for milk but also complex and well-balanced for black, Malimbe is one of our favourites and weâ€™re excited to be able to offer it again. Full, rich tones of toffee, chocolate and bourbon at the bottom end are matched by distinct notes of citrus and blackberry on top.
