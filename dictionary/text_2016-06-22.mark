 Cost & Value of a Great Cup of Coffee
 An absolute stunner. This sweet and creamy coffee is new to us this year and is wowing us with every cup. 
 We overheard someone from our coffee team describe this one like a “pancake breakfast,” warm and buttery with maple syrup sweetness. Quickly becoming a staff favorite.

 This project is a first step towards sourcing incredible new coffees from producers we’ve never worked with before. After a few days of 12-hour cupping marathons, our coffee team selected these top-tier lots out of hundreds for our El Nevado coffee. The end result has exceeded our expectations and we look forward to developing many new relationships here.
 Across the high peaks of Southwest Colombia, you’ll find the departments of Nariño, Tolima, Huila, and Cauca. You’ll also find some of the best coffee in the world.

 You can subscribe to  Beta Blend.
 While many of our drip coffee blends are noteworthy for their low-toned sturdiness, Beta Blend is a bit of a different animal – glassy, complex, floral. A collaborative project between our Sourcing and Digital teams, it offers a daintier counterpoint to our Three Africans, Bella Donovan, and Giant Steps. It is available for online purchase exclusively.

 A sleek and lightweight little powerhouse. The Porlex mini is a favorite around here to pack in our camp coffee kits. 
 We love this grinder on-the-go with easy adjust grind. Hand grinders do take a little elbow grease, but burr is better!  (It will take about two minutes to grind coffee when full.)

 
              Invented by engineer Alan Adler, of Aerobie Frisbee fame, the AeroPress has, fittingly, inspired crazy ingenuity in variety of brew methods. The portable and lightweight AeroPress brews a sweet, full-bodied cup wherever you are: at home, camping or on a road trip. This particular method is best when you’re out in the field or if you don’t have a scale.

 Kilenso Mokonissa is one of the smallest villages in the Borena Hagermariam District of Sidama. In the past the coffees coming from Kilenso would have been blended into larger lots and sold under the area’s catch all name “Ardi.” The farmers there use organic practices (though they are too poor to pay for the certification) so as to not waste anything they produce.
 Lavender and grape jam balance this naturally processed coffee. It is a testament to the diligent care put forth by a very small group of people

 The production of exceptional coffees is a collaborative, meticulous and multi-faceted effort. All coffees are sourced in freshly harvested lots through direct relationships with producers and cooperatives committed to quality and sustainable business practices. We travel to origin throughout the year, exploring new coffee sources, checking in with cherished producers, and offering premiums for quality. The long-standing partnerships we nurture are built upon trust—trust that our producers will convey to us what they need to thrive and trust that we will do everything we can to support them. Visit Our Company page to learn more about our sourcing practices.
 We work to bring forth the unique flavors from each farm or cooperative to your cup in the most humble, efficient, and honorable way possible. We achieve this by taking meticulous care throughout the roasting process. Practicing smaller production methods and sensory roasting allow us to find the best expressions for each coffee. Using our eyes, ears, nose, and most importantly our taste buds, we evaluate our coffees on a regular basis to ensure we are showcasing the very best attributes of each.
 For a coffee to be certified organic by the USDA, strict regulations and certifications are enforced at all levels of production. As the farms we partner with don’t always possess the financial resources to gain these certifications, we don’t require our coffees to be USDA Organic or Fair Trade Certified. However, most of the farms we work with practice organic and ecologically conscious growing methods. Through direct trade, we are able to offer producers substantially higher prices for their coffee.
 All coffees have a shelf life, and should ideally be served within fourteen days of the roast date. Coffee will taste best when ground immediately before brewing. Grind only the amount of coffee you plan to brew and store the remainder in an airtight container, away from direct sunlight, heat, and sources of humidity. Avoid putting your coffee in the refrigerator or freezer.  
 Because coffee is a seasonal fruit, we source it from origin in tiny, freshly harvested lots. Harvest cycles happen throughout the year, with coffees from different regions landing at different times. Once a shipment arrives stateside, we have a few months to roast and serve the coffee. As a result, you will rarely see a particular single origin coffee on our menu for more than a few months at a time as we will only serve coffees at their finest and freshest. We work to curate a very special coffee experience for you, both in our coffee bars and when you’re brewing our beans at home. If you would like help choosing a coffee, please contact info@sightglasscoffee.com and we can provide some recommendations.
 You can use any coffee with any brew method, although some sing better than others when made with different brewing devices. In general, brew methods will either highlight the flavor clarity of a coffee or highlight the body and mouthfeel. For example, a french press, because it has a metal filter, allows oils and insoluble components to enter your final cup of coffee, which enhances the coffee’s overall body. A Chemex, because of its thick paper filter, catches a lot of those insoluble components and emphasizes clarity. At our cafes, we brew all coffees through a V60 or Fetco as we feel that gives us a balanced representation of each coffee without favoring one aspect of its flavor profile. If you want to have fun and experiment, for coffees that are complex and have lots of delicate flavors, like most East African coffees, try a brewer with a paper filter. For coffees with a noteworthy heaviness and mouthfeel, like Central and South American coffees, try a full-immersion brewing method.
 Our coffees are served at a variety of wonderful cafes, restaurants, and other establishments throughout the country (and internationally!). You can also purchase many of our offerings, including seasonal single origin favorites and year-round staples, in our webstore. For more information on where to find our coffees near you, please email info@sightglasscoffee.com.

 The Sudan Rume type of Arabica coffee has long been used in breeding to improve the cup quality of new hybrids and cultivars, but is rarely grown on its own. Granja La Esperanza of Valle de Cauca, Colombia began growing this type on their Finca Las Margaritas to celebrate the spectacular attributes it can bring to the cup. This honey processed lot is delicate and sweet with floral highlights, notes of sweet strawberry jam and a rounded yet delicate body.
 **NOTE**  Due to the limited nature of this release we will only be roasting and shipping this offering on Mondays.  Orders containing this coffee placed after 3pm on Sunday will be shipped and processed the following week.

 In blind cuppings, most people can’t even tell that this coffee is decaffeinated, and even pick it as their favorite on the table. Naturally decaffeinated coffee refers to the use of pure water and proprietary carbon filters to remove caffeine from the coffee bean, as opposed to harsh and cheap chemical processes. Naturally decaffeinated coffee tends to have an accentuated body, which is why our staff and customers alike love our Huila.

 The Hartmann family’s coffee has become a Phil & Sebastian staple. They take an innovative approach to quality and are constantly experimenting with varieties and processing methods. Sebastian is continually involved in giving feedback and discussing new directions. It’s a true partnership.
 Ratibor is in charge of R&D, quality assurance, roasting, and sales. He is also a certified Q Grader. Allan is in charge of processing, manages the beneficio (wet and dry mills), and is also a carpenter. Alexander is in charge of the farm management, picking schedules, and ensuring coffee tree and vegetation health. Kelly is the mechanic, and works on the many numerous machines that run the mill. Lastly, Alice, the lone sister, is in charge of administration, accounting, and running the various bird watching and nature tours that go through their farm. Naturally, the families of each sibling also contribute and together they form the Hartmann “clan”, as they are affectionately known. 
 Over the past five years Sebastian has made many visits to the Hartmann family farm. During these visits, he has worked with the Hartmanns on improving many aspects of their business and production. The dedication the Hartmanns exhibit to the quality of product is admirable, and makes for a wonderful partnership. 
 In 2013, the family improved drying procedures by increasing their quantity of drying beds, which allowed the coffee to dry slowly. In 2014, the Hartmanns worked to better their selection of ripe cherry. In 2015 they raised the bar with the storage of some of their parchment in climate control and in 2016 they improved their dry-milling techniques, resulting in coffee that is cleaner and has even better shelf life. 
 Sebastian and Ratibor had a great visit this past February, during which they discussed some improvements that will be happening at the Hartmann farms for 2017, but also visited Ratibor’s new farm, which will begin to produce next year. This is exciting because it will be the highest elevation farm for the family and will produce a number of exotic and exciting coffee varieties.

 You can subscribe to  Giant Steps.
 A blend of organic coffee that is quite dark and chocolaty. Maybe a bit more one-dimensional than the Bella Donovan, but it is a good dimension. Giant Steps is delightfully fudgy and thick in a French press or drip pot, and stands up to cream quite well. If it were any heavier-bodied, you could pour it on pancakes.

 San Jose Poaquil (just outside Chimaltenango and a 2 hour drive from Antigua) is grown and collected at an altitude of 1500 - 2000 m.a.s.l. by various families of small producers. The team at Beneficio Bella Vista work with the cherry; separating day lots to be ready for us to visit, cup and blend.
 The vision behind this cherry collection project is eventually to have these small holder farmers processing and drying their own production. With altitudes soaring to 2000 meters, the potential here seems endless. This new 2016 crop of Poaquil is sweet and vibrant with creamy texture, and soft spring flavours of rhubarb and apricot.

 b: northwest coffee roaster notoriously fueled by good folks and Led Zeppelin
 Coava began in Matt Higgins’ garage in 2008. The veteran barista and roaster bootstrapped the company by repairing motorcycles. His ambitions were to one day roast and prepare coffees that would be exciting for baristas and inviting to everyday drinkers. To do this, Matt knew that sourcing excellent "coava" would have to be the anchor of everything he did.
 So he studied agriculture, farm practices, and sustainable business. He learned from everyone that he could and at the first chance he began traveling to the major coffee growing regions. He sought farmers whose careful work was producing quality crops with the type of complexity and balance that many single origin coffees didn't have at the time. His willingness to do what others would not eventually earned him a reputation among coffee producers as a respectful, diligent, and honest man. Those early years were adventurous and difficult, but laid the foundation for the many long-standing partnerships Coava has with farmers today.
 With great coffees in hand, Coava began sharing them through a handful of Pacific Northwest coffeehouses. These early believers led the way for Coava to open our brew bar and roastery in southeast Portland in 2010. We are indebted to and thankful for their support on this journey.

 How do I pick a coffee? Baffled about which coffee to pick? Take our Coffee Quiz! Or feel free to give us a call or email us (1-800-563-0860 or help@lacolombe.net. Our Coffee Crew would love to help you find a coffee that suits your taste buds.  What are cupping notes? Does this mean your coffee is flavored? Our coffees do not contain added flavors. However, each of our single-origin coffees and blends has its own unique flavor. Those flavors and aromas come naturally from the coffee bean and can be affected by factors like country of origin, altitude, growing practices, processing techniques, and roasting styles. Coffees roasted more lightly have more of the characteristics unique to eachorigin, while those roasted on a darker level have more of the classic chocolatey and smoky tones found in our Classic and Reserve Blends.  The tasting notes that you’ll find on your bag of La Colombe coffee are what we taste when we brew and drink the coffee. By creating a simile between what we’re tasting in the coffee and familiar flavors we’ve had before (chocolate, apple pie, toasted marshmallow, etc.), it’s easier to communicate the often complex tastes that coffee can take on.  What grind should I choose? The choice of grind will depend on how you brew your coffee. Usually, we recommend ordering your coffee whole bean and grinding it fresh before you brew. But if you don’t have a good-quality grinder, let us pre-grind it for you! We recommend the following grinds for specific brewing methods: Drip for regular automatic drip coffee machines Melitta/Chemex for pourovers Turkish a fine grind for Turkish coffee French Press a semi-coarse grind for immersion methods Home Espresso a fine grind for home espresso machines Commercial Espresso an even finer finer for commercial espresso machines Percolator a grind only to be used for a percolator coffee maker  Why does grind size matter? Read more here. What are your café location and hours? Our national locations and hours can be found at our Cafés page here at this link.
 What is the best way to store coffee? The best way to store coffee in an airtight container in a dark cupboard. There’s no need to freeze! Just keep your beans away from sunlight, air, and humidity.  How long is the shelf life? We recommend drinking your bagged coffee within 8 weeks of the roasting date. The coffee will not spoil after this date, but it will lose the amazing aromas and flavors we strive for in roasting.  Our cans of coffee remain fresh for about a year.  Our Pure Black cold-pressed bottled coffee has a shelf life of 7-8 weeks.  How do I brew coffee? There are infinite ways to brew coffee, and all coffee folks have their own strong opinions as to what makes the best cup. For our recommendations, check out our brewing tips video or our blog.  What is the difference between classics, reserves and single origins? What are seasonal single origins blends? At La Colombe, we have three different coffee lines. Classic Blends are our cornerstone blends that have been here since the very beginning. These are the coffees we drink on a daily basis, and if you’re new to La Colombe, we recommend checking them out! Reserve Blends are modern and refined specialty blends take you on a journey of different flavors, all while remaining within the traditional coffee wheelhouse. Workshop Coffees are roasted in small batches and come from a single origin, usually a single farm or specific region of a country. Our seasonal Workshop blends are comprised of multiple unique, single-origin coffees.  How do I return a product I did not like?

       Water Avenue Coffee.

 
			Though a small country, Guatemala produces some exceptional coffee. We’ve been visiting since 2011 and have developed great relationships with farmers like Ricardo Zelaya and Patricia Perez. Guatemalan coffee can be very interesting, complex, and has so much potential. Over the years we’ve been fortunate to see a lot of this potential realized in through our partnerships and projects with amazing coffee producers.
		
 Our long-standing relationship with Luis Pedro Zelaya and his cousin, Ricardo Zelaya can be traced back to our initial visits in 2011. This family has earned respect amongst coffee roasters worldwide. Both Luis Pedro and Ricardo take great care of the coffee from the picking all the way through the processing stage. In the last few years we’ve made some large investments into their farms to improve picking — over 90% picked is now ripe cherry! — and have supported them as they built new drying greenhouses with raised beds. 
 Over the last three years we’ve also worked closely with Patricia “Paty” Perez and her farm, El Diamante. Her very remote farm produces some of the best coffee from the area. Recently, we spent some time on Paty’s farm and helped her build new raised drying beds. We provided her with a moisture meter to properly determine end point and coached her on how to manage the beds properly. Paty’s enthusiasm for the projects is infectious and we both couldn’t be prouder of the results. She’s excited to work with us next year on extending this project. 
 For the past two years we have worked with Tono Hernandez, a small producer who delivers cherry to Luis Pedro. We’ve collaborated with Luis Pedro on projects to ferment and dry his coffees separately, something we believe can infinitely increase its potential. Luis Pedro has also worked closely with Tono to make improvements on his farm. As a result of this work, we’ve seen the quality and consistency of his coffee improve tremendously and are excited to continue the partnership.
 All of this work that we are doing in Guatemala is very rewarding, as it allows us to realize the incredible potential of Guatemalan coffee.

 La Serrania is an exceptional decaf offering comprised of coffees produced and processed in classic southern Colombia small holder farmer fashion. Several producers throughout Colombia’s Huila department contributed to this lot. The relatively new method of decaffeination is accomplished using ethyl acetate created from Colombian-grown sugar cane. The result is a sweet and round cup which presents red fruit, cocoa and guava.
 Fresh coffee is roasted every Sunday, Monday and Wednesday and shipped the following day. Please place your order by 5:00 PM Eastern Time the evening before the respective roast day to ensure that it is included.

 For the metal heads among us. Designed by artist and former Stumptown employee Joseph McVetty. A Stumptown staff favorite.
 The Klean Kanteen is good-looking, durable, and keeps coffee hot or cold literally for hours. Wide mouth for easy filling and cleaning. Limited-edition design. 

 These guides serve as a good place to start. The grinder you use, coffee you choose, and yes, even the water from your sink, can alter the taste in the cup. Every machine is different, so you’ll want to think of these parameters more as guidelines than law. Play around with your brewer and parameters to get each coffee to taste just how you like it.
 Get an in depth lesson on milk steaming, the basics of pouring latte art, how to formulate designs, and more. This is a 2 hour class led by our Director of Education Evan Damkoehler. A must class for any home barista.
 The class will be on Saturday July 2nd from 7PM-9PM

	The San Sebastian is a coffee showcasing the work of small shareholders in the municipality of La Plata in Huila. The coffee is produced by the Asociacion de Productores de Cafe de Alta Calidad del Occidente del Huila (OCCICAFE).  The profile found in this coffee is the result of piecing together around 30 exceptional lots to create a clean and sweet cup.  Nearly one thousand lots are cupped to build a lot of this size and quality. The growers involved in OCCICAFE all work side by side with quality analysis and are responsible for the harvesting, milling and drying of their coffee. La Plata is a small town of about 50,000 residents which was initially named San Sebastian de La Plata by early settlers. While La Plata has historically been known for silver, today’s economy is mostly agriculture. This season will mark the 5th harvest we have purchased from San Sebastian!

 A toasty, roasty cup for those who love darker flavors. You have never tasted a dark roast quite like this.
 Big aromas of dark chocolate and clove live in this rich, full-bodied cup.

 Our French Roast redefines what a dark roast can be. Toasty but never burnt, this blend brings incredibly layered flavors within a classic dark cup. 
 These beans are removed at the second “crack” — an audible sound the beans make when they’ve reached the maximum amount of heat that preserves flavor and lets you taste the roast itself.
 Coffees made entirely from USDA-certified organic beans

 Please fill in the form below if you'd like to be notified when it becomes available.
 A balanced acidity reminiscent of passionfruit combines with a velvety mouthfeel to deliver this elegant and nuanced Nyeri county coffee. 
 Beginning in 1956 with just 250 member smallholder farmers, the Othaya Farmers Cooperative Society has grown to over 15,000 members who deliver their coffee cherries to one of their nineteen Nyeri county factories - among them, the Rukira factory. 
 Processing at the Othaya factories involves traditional pulping, double-fermentation, washing and sun-drying, but the Cooperative Society doesn’t stop there in supporting and empowering members to produce the highest quality possible; 
 From operating a nursery and farm store to provide inputs and seedlings to members; to integrating their own dry-milling operation allowing them to control quality through final hulling, sorting and grading phases; Othaya’s progressive approach to quality control inevitably leads us to some of our favorite Kenyan coffees, year after year. 
 This lot is a selection of the grade-AA beans from the members of the Rukira Factory. During the dry-milling process, coffee bean size is measured with an assortment of screens with holes of varying diameters. Grade-AA coffees are comprised of only the largest beans in the lot.

 We have an excellent new Imperial Reserve offering from the legendary Arnulfo Leguizamo.
 You can click onto image to purchase this offering or read below for more information.
 Arnulfo Leguizamo is the example of what a Colombian coffee farmer should aspire to be. Based on his reputation for consistently exceptional coffee, he has become one of the most recognized names amongst coffee producers throughout the world. In 2011, when he won the Colombian Cup of Excellence, with Primavera, his first farm. That year his coffee commanded the unprecidented price in the COE auction of $45 a pound. With that money he was able to take his family on vacation to see the ocean along with investing his winnings into his farms. He is a leader within his community, passing his experienced knowledge along to other memebers of the Association Los Naranjos, a 97 member farmer group which has established a strong reputation in it’s own right. Along with exhibiting the ability to produce outstanding cup quality year after year, Arnulfo has become a strong leader within his community, passing his experienced knowledge along to others. We are proud to be able to offer his coffee as our newest Imperial Reserve.
 Arnulfo Leguizamo’s Finca Primavera leads with flavors of lemon, apricot and honey before developing sweet tones of blackberry cobbler and Dubble Bubble gum. There is an herbal tannin in the finish that pairs well with the blackberry sweetness and turns the lemon notes into an Arnold Palmer. The clarity, delicateness, and sweetness are a testament to the skill Arnulfo has developed in his years of experience. This is the perfect coffee to drink on the porch on these warmer summer days.
  We are happy to introduce a new member of the Spyhouse team!
 Meet Kermit Graber, Director of Sales.
 The ritual of coffee weaves its way into my life on many levels, from observing a coffee drinking family, working as a barista, to continually finding passion in all aspects of coffee culture. I remember vividly, as a child watching my family open a can of what was probably low quality coffee, and being infatuated by the smell of the ground beans. That appreciation for the simple act of spending time with one another over a cup of coffee is embedded into my being.
 As Director of Sales for Spyhouse Coffee Roasters, I am ready to continue the company's commitment to passionate coffee production while supporting and building relationships at every level of this industry. My background leads me to approach coffee as an art form. One that is always evolving and inspired through levels of mastery and exploration. I'm excited about diving into the continual learning process and creative curiosities which stem from the history of Spyhouse. 
 I look forward to working with you and celebrating all things coffee!Kermit Graber
 Recently, our Director of Coffee, Tony Querio, sat down with Joe Marrocco and Meister of Café Imports for a debate on coffee roasting as part of their new coffee podcast, Opposites Extract (episode 6). While debate season may be (mostly) behind us at this point, Tony, Joe, and Meister had an excellent discussion on the quality of green coffee versus roaster influence, as well as what went into Tony's recent victory at the U.S. Roaster Championship, this past month in Atlanta, GA. Click the image below and have a listen!
 Spyhouse Coffee Roasters is incredibly proud of our Director of Coffee, Tony Querio, for taking 1st place overall in the 2016 U.S. Roaster Championship this past week, as part of the SCAA Expo in Atlanta, GA. The annual U.S. Roaster Championship (formerly the Roasters Choice Competition) is designed to highlight the art and craft of coffee roasting. This year’s event was determined by input from both a panel of judges and attendees, who then voted on/scored each offering. Every competitor was given the same green coffee to roast for the first round, and a coffee of the roaster’s choosing was provided for round two.
 Our selection for this competition came from producer Juan Peña’s farm, La Papaya, in Saraguro, Southern Ecuador. The strength of our relationship with this producer and coffee makes the award that much sweeter, and we couldn’t be happier to share this honor. 
 Juan Peña is a very rare example of a completely unique coffee producer. His story and his coffee are like none other. Rather than continuing in a multi-generation path to coffee farming, Juan’s story with coffee began just a five years ago in an area where coffee trees have never existed before. His family’s hacienda had been producing long-stemmed roses for years, but a massive off-season rainstorm destroyed all the plants, causing him to replant the property with Typica, one of the two original cultivated coffee varieties. Applying unique practices he developed in his years producing ornamental flowers, Juan individually fertilizes each plant through a complicated irrigation system. This system causes the plants to act as if they are always peak production. The strain on his plants, from constantly being in production, creates an incredibly dynamic and complex cup, unlike any other coffee in the world. In only five years, Juan has already produced three full harvests. We were able to visit his farm during the most recent harvest and have been able to purchase his top lot for each of his three production cycles.
 We have just finished releasing an all new menu of single origin offerings for the Spring. Please allow us to introduce them to you.

 Within the well respected micro region of Pedegral lies a small village, Agua Blanca. Cousins Walter and Juvenal Penna are the shining producers of this “jewel in the crown” that is Agua Blanca. In the highest elevations of Agua Blanca both producers operate their own farms and washing stations maintaining the same standards as the other. Beyond their exceptional practices, one of the other secrets to their quality is the combined varietal makeup. Walter produces Typica and Yellow Bourbon while Juvenal grows exclusively Caturra – a combination rarely seen in Colombia. This is the second year we have worked with Walter & Juvenal and are proud to be able to offer their coffees once again. Never have we experienced a coffee carry such a similar flavor profile over two years. The cousin’s skilled farming practices and processing techniques come together to make a consistently amazing coffee that we love both brewed and served as a single origin espresso.
 Agua Blanca starts off with sweet fruit tones of ripe strawberry, orange and peach and an underlying menthol-like herbaliness that reminds us of wild wintergreen. Cooling, the cup richens into flavors of milk chocolate and toffee, similar to Toblerone bars. This coffee, just like last year, is full of candied fruit tones such as preserved cherries and orange, which combined with the sweeter wine finish, reminds us of the Minnesota classic - the brandy old fashion. It is the perfect coffee to toast the hard work and continued excellence of those around you.
 The Highlands of Papua New Guinea are stocked with challenges toward quality coffee production. Due to the immense diversity of indigenous tribes, many of which had no interaction with the western world until the 1930’s, there are over 800 distinct languages spoken throughout the country. The majority of mills that still operate were originally installed on massive commodity grade plantations in the 1920’s with seeds from Jamaica’s Blue Mountain. Today, 85% of coffee is grown by smallholder farmers, each owning anywhere between just a couple to a couple hundred trees.
 Kunjin operates a mill they lease on one of the original 15 coffee plantations, but purchases cherry from substance farmers in the Waghi Valley. They are able to control quality throughout the milling process, cupping day lots and building micro lot level containers to be processed separately.
 Kunjin is a beautifully complex and dynamic. Ripe plum initially comes to the forefront, offset by lime zest and a bouquet of sweet herbs. As it cools, the cup maintains its liveliness and picks up notes of white grape, coming together into a beautiful winey finish. This coffee is the highest quality lot we have seen from PNG, if not all of the Asian-Pacific region, and just may reshape your impression of the region. It is the perfect coffee for pairing with buttery pastries, whether sweet or savory. 
 The climate and geography of Eastern Congo are a dream for growing coffee. However, to live in Congo is truly a nightmare. 
 Lake Kivu comes to us from the over 5,600 members of the Sopacdi cooperative, on the shores of Lake Kivu. Most of these farmers have recently returned to their homes after being driven away by the rebel troops spilling over from Rwanda. Over twenty percent of the cooperative’s membership are women. Many are widows whose husbands died trying to smuggle their coffee into Rwanda while the Conogolese market was virtually non-exsistent. They live in small, remote villages in the mountainous highlands surrounding Lake Kivu. The cooperative is headquartered in the village of Minova, where they just completed building the first coffee washing-station in Congo in over forty years. Additionally, this is the first coffee from DR Congo to acheive the top national grade - Kivu 2 - since 1967.
 Lake Kivu’s first sip springs forward with tones of fresh cherry, developing into notes of fresh-cut flowers, clementine, peach, and buttery pie crust. As the cup cools, the floral tones open up into earthy green tea acting as a nice foundation for the brighter, sweet fruit we see in the forefront. This coffee is very juicy, turning into a slightly dry effervescent mouth-feel in the finish which reminded us of Bottle Cap candies. It is the perfect coffee to greet the oncoming summer sunshine.
 We are very pleased to announce the release of our latest Imperial Reserve offering from Colombian Cup of Excellence winner, Luis Morales.Luis Hernando Morales Arias was born in Bogata, Colombia but moved with his mother to Gaitania at age 11 to collect her paternal inheritance. Growing up in the country, he was immersed in the coffee growing culture, spending his life advancing his coffee cultivation knowledge. Luis has seen his participation in the Cup of Excellence as a way for him to continue his education. This dedication to improving his skill has deffinitely paid off as this lot, La Esmerelda, placed 11th in the Colombian national competition. La Esmerelda is operated by Luis, his wife, and their two children.The Cup of Excellence was created by the Alliance for Coffee Excellence to find and reward the highest quality coffee producers in each country that it operates. International judges volunteer to blindly taste and score submissions through multiple rounds, ultimately selecting the top twenty coffees. The winners are then placed in an auction for buyers to bid on their desired lots. The premiums a high-placing winner can receive are often life changing.Luis Morales starts off with rich, juicy cherry and chocolate notes and carries a heavy lingering finish like a well-aged rum. As it cools, more floral, citric, and spiced notes come forward. This coffee is incredibly complex, yet very approachable and fitting for the season. It is the perfect coffee for enjoying with family this Holiday season.Available now at any of our cafes and online.
 Otilio Leiva returns to us for the second year in a row. Through five tables of offering in our sourcing trip last year, Otilio stood out as a top selection. We were later surprised to learn that it was the first year Beneficio San Vicente isolated his harvest to produce a single producer lot based on his improving quality. San Vicente is an exceptional, quality driven mill run by the Paz family. The micro-lot program is handled by Benjamin, who maintains clear communication between producers and roasters, while the quality control operations are maintained by his cousin Arturo. Each member of the Paz family are themselves among the top producers of Honduras who share their experience and knowledge with the many producers in their network. The Los Andes region is incredibly slick and steep; often requiring mules to carry the daily harvests down the single-track trail. In his first year producing a micro-lot Otilio only produced 3 exportable bags, however this year he was able increase his output to 10. We are honored to be once again offering Otilio Leiva’s crop and be a part of his growth as we see his coffee improve.
 Otilio Leiva starts off tasting of fresh peach and buttery pie crust, developing into notes of blackberries stewed in white wine. There is a long lingering finish of fresh herbs such as mint, thyme, and sage. This coffee carries the rich stonefruit tones we first fell in love with, but shows the clarity of another year of farm improvements. It is the perfect coffee to sip as you celebrate the relationships in your life this time of year.
 José Amado Fernández is a historically exceptional producer. He placed first in the 2010 Honduran Cup of Excellence, and sixth in 2013. Don Amado, the farm’s namesake and José’s father, passed this farm down to his four sons. Each son inherited his own lot, but share a central facility for washing and processing. The brothers individually oversee their own parcel and process their coffee separately. José Amado Fernández’s parcel is 4.2 hectares and directly overlooks Lake Yojoa, the largest in Honduras. Our relationship with José began with us visiting his farm during the harvest of 2014. He had one of the cleanest and most organized farms we have ever seen. That attention to detail on a farm level carries throughout his production resulting in a beautiful cup. We have been able to commit to purchasing José’s second harvest each year and are proud to bring this back in for the second time. The peach notes and richness carries over from last year, but we are seeing significantly more complexity and improvement in the cup quality overall. Don Amado initially tastes like spiced chocolate and dark nuts, but as it cools the sweetness moves more forward, creating a much more complex cup. The interaction between the spiced nut tones and light carameliness remind us of traditional pecan pie; finishing with a rich stonefruit note similar to peach infused sweet tea. This coffee is dense, complex, and fitting for the season. It is the perfect coffee for these cooler fall mornings.
 The Aguilera Brothers manage six farms and their own micro-mill operation entirely within the family, with the exception of a few pickers during the harvest season. The 12 brothers and sisters inherited the farms from their parents and are now incorporating the third generation into the family business. Each of their farms is planted almost exclusively with Villa Sarchi, a mutation of Bourbon native to the region. This dwarf varietal is known for high production yields and often carries exceptionally floral cupping notes and elegant, tropical fruit acidities. Many Villa Sarchi coffees can be unbalanced in their intensity, but each coffee we have tasted from the Aguilera Brothers has been far more refined than any other from this region. Last year we were able to begin our relationship with the Aguilera Brothers when Tony – our green buyer – visited the farms to meet the family and bought a honey processed lot from Finca Angelina. This year we are honored to serve this washed selection from Finca Chayote, located 200 meters higher in elevation on their most picturesque property. Finca Chayote starts off pear-like with soft herbal notes that develop into honeyed floral lemon tones very similar to an elderflower cordial. This coffee also has an intriguing mouthfeel that starts off very silky and syrupy but turns effervescent with a sweet, lingering finish. It is the perfect coffee for sipping while sitting on a dock, overlooking a calm lake.
 Don Ignacio Gutierrez has been El Salvador’s Cup of Excellence Champion in 2011, 2013, and 2015. The family transitioned to coffee production in 2005 after a long history of growing wood trees and tomatoes. Their first two farms, Los Positos and La Roxanita, consisted of just 500 trees. Their land’s sandy loam soil and skilled farming practice lead them to great success in a short amount of time. Each year’s COE winnings were invested back into their farms, allowing them to continually improve harvests. Winning a single COE is an impressive achievement in it’s own right; to win three within five years is an exceptional feat. The lot that began the Gutierrez family’s legacy was the 2011 harvest of this microlot, Finca La Roxanita’s honey processed pacamara. The region of Chalatenango has built a solid reputation for amazing honey processed pacamaras and this farm is one that laid that foundation. 
 Ignacio Gutierrez’s honey pacamara from Finca La Roxanita starts bright and fruity with notes of ripe blackberry and allspice. As it develops on the palate there are complex  tones of grilled pineapple, vanilla, and lime with a slight resinous nature that together reminds us of a bright California chardonnay aged on new oak. This coffee is dynamic and complex, but is in no way off-putting. It is the perfect coffee to showcase the mastery Ignacio applies to coffee production, allowing him to be one of the most consistent and  outstanding producers in coffee today.

 Roasting is the mark we put on the coffees we source, we translate the work of the coffee producer into the nearly finished product. The roast is a hugely transformative part of coffee’s path from seed to cup. Through heat, time and intuition, we transition the coffee from an ultra dense, bitter and fibrous state to a form we can grind, brew and enjoy.
 We aim to roast in such a way that brings out our favorite flavors in each particular coffee. We never push our presence with roast flavor, but we have well developed coffees that are deliciously drinkable. No two coffees are the same; even from year to year the crop from the same farm changes. Roasting requires attention to detail and responsiveness to the changing coffee and environment. With every roast, every day, we taste and adjust and learn more about the coffees and the craft of coffee roasting.
 At its core, roasting coffee is a craft and a science. In the real world, it’s a production job that requires responsiveness to an ever-changing product and a skill for repeatability and consistency. There is so much scooping and lifting and heat and noise and sniffing and frustration and satisfaction. We try to maintain a consistent product while being able to explore the possibilities of each coffee, and we do it every day so that the coffee we’re putting out in the world is as fresh as can be! 
 We try super hard. Please just like us. :)

 Kilenso Mokonissa is one of the smallest villages in the Borena Hagermariam District of Sidama. In the past the coffees coming from Kilenso would have been blended into larger lots and sold under the area’s catch all name “Ardi.” The farmers there use organic practices (though they are too poor to pay for the certification) so as to not waste anything they produce.
 Lavender and grape jam balance this naturally processed coffee. It is a testament to the diligent care put forth by a very small group of people

 Avg Farm Size:Â 5 hectares to 50 hectares.
 Common Varieties:Â Caturra, Catuai, Villa Sarchi
 Whether washed, honey, or natural, Costa Rica leads the way with immaculate processing.Â Very clean, sweet, lemon, and toffee cups in the middle altitudes, and almost bottomless, sugary, raisin syrup cups at higher elevations.Â 
 Central Valley, WestÂ Valley, Guanacaste, Tres Rios, Turrialba, Orosi, Brunca, Tarrazu
 Tarrzu accounts for nearly 35% of the total coffee production in Costa Rica. The altitudes of 1000â1800m produce some of the most nuanced coffee profiles in Costa Rica. Tarrazu has been home to some of the most impressive advancements in coffee processing in the country, and the result is extremely clean coffees. Tarrazu is able to produce extremely high qualities of larger lots of coffee in addition to microlots.Â 
 The Central Valley comprises San Jose, Heredia and Alajuela provinces. The region is characterized by having a well-defined wet and dry season. The coffee plantations are at a range of 1000 to 14000 masl. The Central Valley yieldsÂ nearly 15% of the total production in the country.Â 
 The coffee plantations are located at an altitude range of 800 to 1400 masl. This region has produced an extremely high percentage of CeE winners, and produces nearly 25% of the total coffee production in the country. Primarily Villalobos and Villa Sarchi varieties are found here.
 The region is made up by the Alajuela, Guanacaste, and Puntarenas provinces. The coffee plantations are located in the mountain zones with cooler temperatures. The soil is volcanic, extremely fertile, and has excellent structure.
 The coffee plantations are located near the Irazu Volcano at an altitude range of 1200 to 1560 masl. The soil has a small tropical acidity caused by the volcano; it is rich with organic matter. The soil characteristic allows the good root development, holding moisture and facilitating the oxygen flow, supplying vitality to the tree.
 This region is characterized by having farms that are simultaneously cultivating coffee, cacao, and banana. The altitude range is between 600&ndash1300; masl. Caturra and Catuai varieties are cultivated in this region.
 Coffee has been grown for more than 100 years in Orosi. The fertile land and excellent climate conditions permits the coffee-growing activities. The farms are located at an altitude range of 1000â14000 masl. Volcanic soil and high fertility.
 Brunca consists ofÂ two cantons: Coto Brus and Perez Zeledon.
 Coto Brus: Located between the biological reserve and integrated by San Vito, Sabalito, Agua Buena, Limoncito, Pittier, and Coto Brus districts. The lands are very irregular, with abundant vegetation and good conditions for coffee growing.Â  The farms are located at an altitude range of 900â1400 masl with organic soils.
 Perez Zeledon: This area has an irregular topography because it is a valley surrounded by hills. The valley has abundant rivers with clean water. The valley creates the perfect conditions for microclimates and a diverse ecosystem. Caturra and Catuai varieties are cultivated in the region. The farms are located at an altitude of 1700 masl.
 Costa Rican coffees set the standard for washed (wet processed), bright Central American coffees in both the bean and at the mill. Costa Rican coffees are exceptionally high-grown in mostlyÂ volcanic soil. These two factors come together to produce a very bright and very clean cup. The best Costas develop an intense sugary sweetnessÂ to complement the straight-out brightness. Costa Rican coffees serve as an excellent bright single-origin coffee, and will definitely add life to various blends.
 Costa Rica has also coined the phrase âhoney processedâ for their version of pulped-natural coffees. Honey coffees are coffees dried with all or part of the sugary mucilage still left on the parchment. The result is an intensely sweet and slightly fruity cup. This cup profile is typically about halfway between a fully washed and natural coffee. Costa Rican producers have pushed the boundaries and truly refined in the process like no other country. Much of the rest of the coffee-producing world that is interested in processing experimentation looks to the pioneers in Costa Rica for direction.
 The many different regions of Costa Rica produce coffees with subtle, but distinct, differences in the cup.
 Tarrazu is the marquis region of Costa Rica noted for the best soils and highest altitudes. While no single country or region can guarantee an exact level of coffee year in and year out, as coffee is subject to wind, rain, sun, and other sometimes-less-than-cooperating forces of nature, coffees from Tarrazu do consistently stand out for their brightness and clean cups, with hints of light berry and apple cider.
 Volcan Poas, besides having one of the cooler-sounding coffee region names, it produces some very fine coffee with a bit more fruit than its southern neighbor of Tarrazu.
 Tres Rios in the cup is a bit softer and a bit more balanced than the straight-on, take-no-prisoners brightness of some of the other regions in Costa Rica. Coffees from this region are a great single-origin cup, or introduction to Costa Rican coffees.
 Another amazing feature of Costa Rican coffees is the human touch at the beneficios (mills) where the processing and milling of coffee approaches a level of artistry not easily surpassed. Besides immaculately clean mills, which are the standard, the efficiency and beauty of the inner workings of the mill amaze.
 For example, with strict Costa Rican environmental laws, wastewater from the fermentation tanks is treated with natural bacteria to break down the acidity reducing the pH back to levels that are tolerable for the streams and rivers of the country. By using the wood from pruned old coffee trees, along with the parchment from dry milling, many mills do not use a single stick of outside wood to fire the mechanical dryers. Some of the more inventive mills actually use the methane gasses produced when the bacteria breaks down the fermented pulp to fire the dryers. Finally, sun-dried coffees, of course, are just simplyÂ "solar" powered. All in all, the mills are an impressive sight, from the small single estate to the largest cooperatives.
 With such high standards in Costa Rican coffees to start with, intense cupping pays rewards as we seek out the subtle nuances that make certain cups outstanding among their peers.
 The first coffee seeds arrived to America in 1720, and at the end of 18th century the first Typica seeds were planted in Costa Rica.Â At this time, the agriculture in Costa Rica had a domestic focus. In the year 1808, the governor Tomas de Acosta began promoting the cultivation of coffee.
 Costa Rica was the first Central American country that established a true coffee industry. The priest Felix Velarde is considered to be the first coffee producer in Costa Rica.Â 
 In 1821, Costa Rican independence was achieved from Spain, and the municipal councils were the first to promote coffee cultivation with politics that included the delivery of small trees and land concession to whomever wanted to become a coffee producer. In the same year, Costa Rica had 17,000 coffee trees under production, and had already done the first export that consisted of 2 quintales shipped to Panama.
 In 1832 the first exportation to Europe was made. In the 1840s, the commerce with Europe as consolidated. In the following years, the production increased year by year.
 In 1830, the catalan Buenaventura Espinach Gaul, built the first paved patio and the first wet mill located to the south of Cartago. The micromill has become synonymous with Costa Rican coffee production today.Â 
 The first varieties planted were Typica or Creole, which was characterized by its high productivity and distinctive acidity.Â 
 Today Costa Rica accounts for 1% of the world's total coffee production.Â 
 Today we at CafÃ© Imports have successfullyÂ established our first office in a coffee-producing country. We have a state-of-the-artÂ lab and home base for our buying team in San Jose. Piero Cristiani is leading the charge at this office. Under Piero's direction, we have expanded our sourcing operation in Costa Rica to the point where we are acting as both exporter and importer. Piero and the green team have established many new exciting relationships in Costa Rica that have produced exquisite microlots and impressive full containers.

 Fragrant and creamy, this delicate tea is a bloom with fragrant osmanthus flower and chamomile. A gentle morning or afternoon fresh up.
 Ingredients: China white full leaf tea, Chinese osmanthus flower, Egyptian chamomile petals and natural flavors.

 These delicate, shade-dried leaves from China's Fujian Province are naturally high in antioxidants. Egyptian chamomile petals and Chinese osmanthus flowers add a fragrant, toasty, creamy and slightly sweet bloom of flavor.
 White tea has been popular in China for centuries, but only exported since the late 1800s. Bai Mu Dan, or White Peony, is one of two types of white tea produced in China. It comes from the top two leaves and bud of the tea bush, which are shade dried and lightly fired. This gives White Peony a pale cup color and delicate, nutty aroma. 
 ***Now when you buy a bag of Blue Creek Blend Coffee from any New Seasons Market, Water Avenue Coffee Bar, or online, Water Avenue Coffee will donate 50 cents of the proceeds to help support OMSI.***
 Our House Blend has a new name.  We've relaunched our morning cup of choice as the Blue Creek Blend. This coffee is rich, full bodied, and wonderfully balanced. Farm Direct Coffees from our coffee producing partners in central and south America come together for a cup full of the flavors of hazelnut, milk chocolate, and a hint of navel orange.

 Producer: EXC
Varietal: Ethiopia Heirloom
Region: Guji
Elevation: 1800-2300 meters
Process: Fully Washed
Drying: Sun dried on raised beds
Mouthfeel: Delicate and softly lingers
Aroma: Floral, Cane Sugar Juice
Tasting Notes: Blackberries, Red Plums and Malted Milk Chocolate
 The fundamental reason as to why this coffee is special is the altitude and native varietals to the Guji zone. Coffee can be found growing as high as 2,300 masl and none of the cherry coming into the washing station is grown lower than 1,900. It’s a drier climate than Yirgacheffe and the shade is phenomenal. This would be considered semi-forest in Ethiopia but essentially these coffees grow under a full shade canopy.

 333 years ago, the famed Viennese coffee house Zur blauen Flasche (or, The Blue Bottle) transformed the public into loyal patrons with their Yemeni coffee.
 Centuries later, Mokhtar Alkhanshali, two suitcases of coffee in hand, fled war-torn Yemen through the very port that first supplied Vienna and the world with coffee, heralding the beginning of Yemen’s modern coffee revival.
 Now, in collaboration with Port of Mokha, we’re sharing this venerable drink—from its oldest source—with you.

 “The invigorating wine that raises you to a state of ecstasy.”
 - Translation of Qahwah, the Arabic word from which “coffee” derives

 “It’s a miracle that this coffee is here.”
 - Mokhtar Alkhanshali, Port of Mokha Founder

 A special note from our roasting team: Due to the limited quantities available and the extra care required, we will roast and ship this coffee on Monday mornings.
After tasting a Yirgacheffe coffee at our Mint Plaza cafe, Mokhtar Alkhanshali (Ahl-kahn-sha-lee) began a journey that led him to found Port of Mokha, a Yemeni coffee interventionist project. Known as the site of the first commercially cultivated coffees, Yemen was once home to the world’s most celebrated coffee (the original 17th-century Blue Bottle in Vienna probably offered Yemeni coffee), and Mokhtar’s mission was to help farmers in Yemen restore that famous quality to its coffee trade. Along the way, he faced kidnapping and the outbreak of violent civil war, narrowly escaping to bring this coffee to a table where a modern-day Blue Bottle and a revitalized Yemeni coffee were reunited once again.
 The landscape where Hussein al-Haba’s coffee is grown is so extreme, it’s nerve-wracking. Suspended high on the deserted, rocky, sun-scorched slopes of Yemen’s Hayma region, this coffee grows in what seems like impossible conditions. But then, Hussein al-Haba is not one to shy away from a struggle. Father of three daughters and two sons and provider for his extended family of 25, Hussein has been farming coffee since he was a child, and his 490 coffee trees are a testament to his brilliant resilience.

 Blackberry jam / Sage Honey / Arnold Palmer
 Arnulfo Leguizamo is the example of what a Colombian coffee farmer should aspire to be. Based on his reputation for consistently exceptional coffee, he has become one of the most recognized names amongst coffee producers throughout the world. In 2011, when he won the Colombian Cup of Excellence, with Primavera, his first farm. That year his coffee commanded the unprecidented price in the COE auction of $45 a pound. With that money he was able to take his family on vacation to see the ocean along with investing his winnings into his farms. He is a leader within his community, passing his experienced knowledge along to other memebers of the Association Los Naranjos, a 97 member farmer group which has established a strong reputation in it’s own right. Along with exhibiting the ability to produce outstanding cup quality year after year, Arnulfo has become a strong leader within his community, passing his experienced knowledge along to others. We are proud to be able to offer his coffee as our newest Imperial Reserve.
 Arnulfo Leguizamo’s Finca Primavera leads with flavors of lemon, apricot and honey before developing sweet tones of blackberry cobbler and Dubble Bubble gum. There is an herbal tannin in the finish that pairs well with the blackberry sweetness and turns the lemon notes into an Arnold Palmer. The clarity, delicateness, and sweetness are a testament to the skill Arnulfo has developed in his years of experience. This is the perfect coffee to drink on the porch on these warmer summer days.

 El Manzano Caturra Microlot is sourced from the Luis Gómez family farm in the small department of Nariño—roughly the same square area as the state of Maryland. Nariño borders Ecuador and the Pacific Ocean, but has an extremely diverse geography. Hot plains lie on the Pacific Coast, lush Amazon tropics occupy the central region, and the Andes Mountains traverse north to south along the inland border.
 It is this Andean region that put Nariño on the map as a top coffee producer in the 1990s, when high-volume coffee buyers turned to the region’s farms as source of choice for its excellent coffee. This trend discouraged farmers from producing higher priced, premium coffees.  As these buyers migrated much of their business to other countries, premium coffee demand simultaneously increased and farmers saw an opportunity to sell their unique offerings. Collaborations have resulted, building a network of resources for these farms.
 Luis Gómez and his family have justly reaped the benefit of this shift. The Gómez farm has seen improved efficiency, increased earnings from their coffee sales, and strengthening of their family’s livelihood.

 Our Organic Colombia Tolima comes from the municipality of Planadas in the southern tip of the Tolima Province. Lying in the foothills of the Central Andes, Tolima is known for its mineral-rich soils and fresh water. Though relatively unknown in the coffee industry until recently, Tolima is now the country’s third largest coffee producer and is increasingly being recognized for producing great tasting coffee.
 The beans in this lot come from two small cooperatives in Planadas: ASOPAP and Resguardo Indígena Nasa We’sx.
 The 29 members of the ASOPAP cooperative are fully committed to quality coffee and organic standards from their farms, which are situated at 5,400-6,200 feet. Their beans have yielded excellent cup profiles for some time, drawing attention from international coffee traders.
 The Nasa We’sx are an indigenous community brought to Planadas in the early 1900s by the Colombian Army as a mine workforce. For decades, they were caught in the conflict between the army and the largest guerilla group in the country, FARC, until recently, when they made a peace pact with local guerrillas.

 To drink a cup of Ethiopia Nigusse Lemma is to connect with the origins of coffee.  Beans from Ethiopia’s Limu woreda (district) deliver unique flavors that can only be discovered in heirloom varietals.  Located in the southwestern part of country, Limu is not as well known as Yirgacheffe or Harrar, but deserves the attention that it is receiving.
 Our Ethiopia Niguisse Lemma is sourced from the family farm of Lemma Edeto and is located in the highest elevations of the Limu region.  Shade from old growth trees, water from spring fed stream, and native varietal of coffee that flourish organically are in no better hands than the Edeto Family.  Lemma, with over 60 years in the coffee industry, has passed down the knowledge to his sons Nigusse and Haile, who operate the farm which their father recovered after it was confiscated by the Derg regime in the 1970’s.  The family’s commitment to quality includes a fully natural dry processing that insures no unripend cherries taint the taste of the finished product.  Fully control from farming to milling has resulted in award-winning coffee.  Nigusse and family were recently honored for the African Taste of the Harvest competition awarded by the African Fine Coffee Association.

 This coffee comes to us from the farm of Welser Hernandez, just outside the town of Jacaltenango in the Huehuetenango Region of Guatemala. It’s here that Mr. Hernandez grows and processes his coffee—in the Sierra Madre Mountains that lie in the Western Highlands of the country. Though growing altitudes range from 4,300-5,900 feet, the dry, hot winds from the Mexican plains fend off the threat of frost, naturally protecting the vegetation. After harvest, the beans—predominantly Bourbons and Caturra—are fully washed, then sundried, yielding the coffee bean that we call “Guatemala Mr. Hernandez”, in honor of his commitment to quality.
 Cupping notes : Milk chocolate, Medjool Dates, Raspberry
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Guaya’b is a cooperative of over 300 indigenous Mayan and Quichua farming families in the region of Jacaltenango, Huehuetenango. Since the introduction of coffee into the Jacaltenango region 40 years ago natural habitats, flora and fauna have slowly made a comeback from the once de-forested land. The recreation of the natural habitat has allowed for the reduction of soil erosion, restored natural habits and given the coffee crops a lush canopy that allows them to ripen slowly.
 Rich & delicately fruity; you’ll experience a thought provoking brew that begins with a chewy, chocolaty body that develops into a raspberry jaminess infused with deeper, bright fruit tones that suggest currant and strawberry.
 Cupping notes : Red D’anjou Pear, Raspberry Honey, Malt
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Deep in the interior folds of the Southern Sierra Madre Mountains in Chiapas, Mexico is the coffee growing cooperative of Ramal Santa Cruz. Among this multitude of coffee farms lies the home of Augustin Sanchez Espinoza and his three brothers who all farm together on adjacent parcels of land. The farms of the Brothers Sanchez are at the upper reaches of viable coffee cultivation, starting at 1600 meters and topping at just over 1800 meters, the highest of all coffee grown in the cooperative. The family began planting coffee on the land in the early 1970s. Many of the original plants are still producing. The majority of the coffee is Typica and Bourbon with a scattering of more recently planted Caturra.
 The coffee from these four brothers and their farms make up our Mexico Fair Trade, Organic, Ramal Santa Cruz, Cuatro Hermanos.  This coffee greets you with a red danjou pear citrus acidity followed with hints of raspberry honey and Meyer lemon.  We hope you will enjoy this extraordinarily smooth coffee from the Cuatro Hermanos.
 Cupping notes : Nectarine, Cherry, Caramel

 Situated near a gorilla habitat in the mountains of Central Rwanda, the Dukunde Kawa is a cooperative of 2000 member farmers, more than 80% of whom are women. Its award winning coffees and support from local and international sources have greatly benefited the producers’ families. In 2003, the cooperative was able to build its first washing station with funding from the Rwandan Ministry of Defense. In turn, the cooperative now donates 10 percent of its net profit annually to fund the construction of other washing stations throughout the country. Since receiving Fair Trade certification in 2004, Dukunde Kawa has implemented a direct training program and continued to improve the standard of living for its farmers.
 This coffee is 100 percent Bourbon varietal, grown at high altitudes ranging from 1,500 – 2,000 meters above sea level, which allows for slower ripening and cooler fermentation temperatures. The Bourbon cultivar and extended fermentation process, along with meticulous washing and sorting, produce a lush coffee with complex fruit notes.

 Our Sumatra Samosir Honey is a unique lot. It is the result of collaboration by three coffee growers from the Lake Toba region of Northern Sumatra. What makes this lot different lies in the coffee processing. Sumatran growers are known for using the unique process of “wet hulling” coffee. But these Lake Toban farmers have taken a still different approach using what is know as the “honey” process—a process originated in Central America but rarely used in Asia. The differences are not only interesting, they result in an entirely different flavor profile.
 The Wet Hulled Process, common to most Sumatran coffees, begins with the coffee being pulped and washed. This removes the sugary mucilage layer, as is done with all washed coffees. The difference with wet hulled coffees is, the beans are removed from their protective parchment layer before they have been allowed to fully dry. This premature exposure of the beans results in Sumatran coffee’s distinctive musty, earthy flavors. The Honey Process, used in producing this Sumatran, is named for the sticky mucilage found once the coffee cherry skin is removed. It is sometimes referred to as “honey”. During the Honey Process, coffee is fully dried with the sugary mucilage before the sugar laden parchment is removed from the bean. The result is a coffee with good sweetness and body but with flavors that are cleaner than traditional Sumatran coffee.

 This weekend, we debuted two new seasonal drinks, and brought back one old favorite. Kirkwood Barista Kim Morice has the details:
 The Shaken Lavender Rose iced latte combines our Espresso 700 with whole milk and a house-made syrup using our Indian Rose Garden tea. This drink is refreshing with subtle notes of lavender and rose, which mixes well with our espresso. 
 Another refreshing addition to our summer menu is our Shaken Rose Garden iced tea. Also using our Indian Rose Garden iced tea, this drink is prepared over ice with an ounce of a honey and lemon simple syrup and shaken to perfection. 
 For the fourth year in a row, we are bringing back our Shaken Honey Almond Cold Brew. Our cold brewed Espresso 700 is combined with honey and a splash of almond milk, and shaken until mixed. This is a guest favorite, a smooth and subtly sweet iced drink is perfect for summer months.

 St. Louis based Kaldi’s Coffee Roasting Co. is excited to announce the opening of four new stores in 2016. These will be the seventh and eighth stores in the St. Louis area and the second and third stores in Atlanta, Georgia for the company. 
 The first St. Louis location to open will be at the Gerhart building, located in the Gerhart Lofts at the corner of Laclede and Vandeventer, next to St. Louis University and the Cortex district. The second will be at the Mid Campus Center (MCC) building, located at 4590 Children’s Place, which is currently under construction on Washington University’s Medical School campus.
 The Gerhart building is located blocks from Kaldi’s Coffee’s Roastery, and will join the burgeoning neighborhood in St. Louis. “With IKEA going in, and SLU right across the street, we saw the potential for this location. When Capstone Development approached us about opening a cafe, we couldn’t have been more pleased,” says Kaldi’s owner Tricia Zimmer-Ferguson. The cafe is part of a larger rehabilitation of the building, with other retail on the first floor and lofts on the second. The building itself dates to 1897 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. “Expect to see some classic architecture and details mixed in with some new modern touches” adds Zimmer-Ferguson.
 “We’ve been looking to add a new location in St. Louis for the past couple years and these two are perfect fits” continues Zimmer-Ferguson. “Our relationship with Washington University just keeps getting stronger, and the new MCC building is going to be a beautiful addition to their campus. We’re excited to build out our location within the larger construction of the building, so we can form our ideal cafe from the ground up.” The Kaldi's Coffee at the MCC is in partnership with Bon Appetit Management Company.
 Kaldi’s Coffee is working with Space Architects on the Gerhart cafe and Christner on the MCC cafe.
 The two new locations in Atlanta, Ga., will join Kaldi’s first Atlanta store at Emory University’s Dobbs University Center. Bon Appetit Management Company and Emory University invited Kaldi’s to open a store there last summer. Building on that success, Kaldi’s will open a full-service cafe at the Depot, a historic train station located at One Eagle Row, in the heart of Emory’s campus, and a coffee bar at the Emory University School of Medicine.
 The Depot was built as the train station for Emory University in 1916, but service there stopped in 1970. Subsequent iterations of the building were an art gallery, a credit union, and a restaurant. “We’re excited to expand our presence at Emory University,” says Kaldi’s owner Tyler Zimmer. “We’ve been developing a different menu for this location too, since we have a full kitchen to work in.”  Kaldi’s is working with Square Feet Studio on the Depot cafe. The Emory University School of Medicine location will consist of coffee service, house-made bakery, and some grab & go items.

 Caitlin, one of our customer service reps, Brandon, from our Kirkwood cafe, and Bud, one of our roasters, were in Las Capucas, Honduras last week. Here are some stories and pictures from their trip.
 We visited Beneficio Santa Rosa de Copan on our way to Las Capucas. Their facility was beautiful and they had a great cupping lab. We took a tour of the dry mill - they poke every bag for QC as they stack them in amazing pyramids in the warehouse. The really large white bags are micro lots that are separated. They are sorting by density and again by color - using electronic sorting (infared camera picks out the ones that aren't the right color). 
 We cupped the top 10 finalists for the cupping competition. There were lots of great coffees throughout the trip so it's no surprise that the top ten scored well (85+). We then went to the zipline! This course consisted of 5 ziplines that took us from a farm to the Las Capucas wet mill - what a great view from above! Brandon was the most courageous - great aerial videos and photos are thanks to him Bud and I were holding on too tight - no free hands for photography! 
 Brandon and I started the morning at the farm of Bernard Ornilla. His entrepreneurial spirit has resulted in many projects to better the community and continually improve quality. Bernard is always moving forward and his farm, Finca de Origenes Planon, is no exception. Located at almost 1700 meters in the Celaque mountains, this farm spreads down the mountainside and makes for a beautiful landscape. Finca de Origenes Planon, meaning "origins", the farm is compiled of many different varietals from many different origins across the globe. We saw red catuai, yellow catuai, and red bourbon among other varieties. Because the farm is organic, many other plants grow among the coffee trees including lemons, limes, avocados, bananas, and plantains. 
 The festivities began later that day with Te Van a Conocer Compa. There was great music, local vendors, wonderful dances and delicious street food. They announced the winners of the competition and we got to meet the farmers who's coffee we will be featuring at Kaldi's. The winner of the competition had visited Atlanta a few years ago. He was beside himself when we shared with him that we were going to feature his coffee in our cafe in Atlanta. What a great connection! We hope to continue to grow our relationship with the producers of Las Capucas in the future.

 A lot of us at Kaldi’s are big big soccer fans. We’ve played growing up, we’ve played in college, our kids play, and we even had a go at an indoor league (check out that picture!). But this may be our proudest soccer moment yet. Starting this year, Kaldi’s is a proud sponsor of the Saint Louis Football Club and St. Louis Scott Gallagher.
 “We followed the club pretty close last year, so when the opportunity arose to be a part of this team, we jumped at the opportunity.” says Kaldi’s co-owner Tyler Zimmer. “Their proud connection to St. Louis and all the work they do with the city and with their youth programs only made us more excited to lend our support.”
 We can’t wait to follow the team in the USL this year, and look forward to the years to come.

 Wednesday was a travel day for our group. After spending the first 2 days in Pyin Oo Lwin, it was time to head to the highlands of Shan state. Myanmar has many different microclimates and the weather changed quite a bit on our drive. It is still 2 months until raining season begins and much of the drive was very brown. It will look very differently in May. It took us 7 hours to make the trip including a few stops to see some amazing heritage sites and pagodas.
 Ywangan is home to many smallholders in the area. In 2013, there was a new emphasis brought to the area to try to increase quality and in return, a better price for their coffee. Traditionally, much of the coffee in the area was either consumed domestically or in China, neither bringing very high prices. Coffee has been grown in this area since 1890, after it was introduced by English Missionaries. There are dozens of small villages in the area and the Myanmar Coffee Association has begun to work with about 30 of them, representing over 400 smallholder farmers. Traditionally, the coffee is washed as each village has their own pulper. Winrock and USAID have helped set up a small cupping lab in Ywangan complete with a sample roaster and dehuller, where we will cup 14 different lots from different villages. Winrock also has a full time Q grader here training locals on technical and cupping skills. The goal is build a sustainable model locally.
 We visited with Myanmar Coffee Association Vice Chairman, U Win Aung Kyaw at a local storage building where coffee is often stored before heading to the Mandalay Coffee Group to be dry hulled. The vice chairman was very grateful for the visit and is very encouraged by the improved quality they are seeing. They have doubled the prices that the local farmers are be paid to incentivize quality. He said they need to continue education and training but they are seeing an impact. Other small growers in the area are noticing the difference and want to be more involved with the association and Winrock. One of the bigger changes has been implementing some new ideas on the processing side. They have been doing some natural process coffees and the results seem encouraging.
 After meeting with U Win Aung Kyaw, we met with Su Su Aung and many other smallholders, all women. She has been very active as a leader in the area since 2004-2005 when she began acting as a broker for the region and encouraging trade between the producers and China. Su Su Aung had a very impressive milling operation and some of the cleanest looking natural coffees you will see in any coffee producing countries. She has had training from Mario Fernadez and Marcelo Pereira, who is a Winrock employee and coffee veteran after stints in Costa Rica, Brazil, and Ethiopia. She is a role model for all the women producers in the region. Her production of naturals is small this year, 2,000 pounds, but she hopes for more next year.
 Thursday we will begin to cup many coffees from the area and visit many local villages to see some production. More to come…  #followthegoat

 It is our second day here in Pyin Oo Lin and we start out the day by heading to the Mandalay Coffee Group’s office and cupping lab. We checked out their mill and the systems they have in place. This is the 2nd year that the mill is in operation and it is as nice as any in the world. All the coffee here is wet processed and fermented 24 hours in concrete tanks. The coffee is then moved to the concrete patios where the coffee is turned and raked until it is dry. It is then moved to their storage facility where the coffee rests until the parchment is ready to be removed at the dry mill. They are still finishing their dry mill on property so their coffee is milled at a nearby facility.
 After the more in-depth tour of the mill we have 2 rounds of tables to cup. There are 17 coffees from the Pyin Oo Lwin region that we are evaluating. For perspective, last there were very few coffees scored over 82 points in the entire country. In this morning’s cupping I scored 11 of the 17 over 82 points with the lowest score being 80 and the highest score 85. This is a dramatic improvement in quality from last year and this is still a very small sample size. Most of the top coffees last year came from the Ywangan area in Southern Shan state which we will see tomorrow and Thursday.
 After cupping we visited two more estates beginning with the Lone Star Estate. The ways that some of the farms get their names is quite funny. In this instance the owner had a friend from Texas and next thing you know you get Lone Star Estate! This was another relatively large farm of about 100 acres, 85 of which is planted with coffee, one of the other crops is dragon fruit. Lone Star grows only the S795 variety which is a hybrid of Liberica and Kent (typica) at 1150 meters above sea level. This is one of the more popularly planted varieties planted in Myanmar. We did come across just a few yellow fruited plants, probably yellow catuai. We had tasted this coffee as a pourover on Monday at the MCG offices but it did not show quite as well on the cupping table, scoring 81.5 for me.
 After Lone Star we headed to other side of Pyin Oo Lwin to Mr. Sai Wan’s farm, Green Land. One of the first things we see is Sai Wan’s nursery filled with SL 34, Sarchimor (a Costa Rica hybrid) and Panama Geisha! He also had macadamia and a type of shade tree called silver oak that was actually an evergreen. Most of the farm is planted with Sarchimor with a small amount dedicated to SL 34. He is planning on planting more SL 34 this year. A large portion of the coffee is washed and fermented 24 hours, though he has begun to do some small experimenting of naturals. Sai Wan had 3 coffees on this morning’s table and all 3 scored 83 points or higher. I scored his lots, 83, 84, and 85 respectively, the 85 lot being a naturally processed lot of sarchimor, great results for his first year of processing naturals!
 Pyin Oo Lwin has been a great experience so far. Such big improvements are being made in a short period of time, though they still have a ways to go in overall quality. Tomorrow we head off to southern Shan, near Ywangan to visit the many small holders in the area.

 We got off to an early start, as we had to leave for the airport in Yangon to fly to Mandalay, the old capitol of Mynmar. It was about a 2 hour flight to Mandalay, in the center of the country. It is hot and dry this time of year, like Yangon, with raining season beginning in April and May. We had a 2 hour drive up some very windy roads to the Pyin Oo Lwin area. 
 As we made our way up the mountains, the temperatures cooled down but the landscape is still very dry this time of year. Our first stop was to the Mandalay Coffee Group and the Myanmar Coffee Association. The Mandalay Coffee Group is a group of local producers that received a grant from Winrock International to build a new wet mill and dry mill. It is state of the art and is among the nicest mills you will see in any coffee producing country. The wet mill has new fermentation tanks and most of the coffee is dried on concrete patios or raised beds. We had brief discussion there with many from the group. They were very enthusiastic about our visit.
 From there we drive about 5 miles to visit our first farm of the trip, Shwe Pu Zun. As we drive up, we see very tall, skinny, evergreen like trees planted in between the rows of coffee. The trees are extremely shaded. We found out later that one reason the trees are so heavy is to keep the temperature of the farm more even since they have threat of frost in this area. They had a small wet mill where all the coffee is washed, some of demucilaged and some is pulped and goes through a 24 hour dry ferment before finishing the washing process. Shwe Pu Zun is about 100 acres planted in 2000-2002. It is mostly planted with Catimor, S795, and SL34. There are probably a few other varieties mixed in, but they are for the most part sorted when picked and processed. Their annual production was about 100,000 pounds grown at about 1050 meters above sea level.
 The next farm we visited was about 40 acres and home to the 2nd place winner in the cupping competition last year, Sithar Farm. This farm is owned by Thu Zaw and his father in the law. The coffee is grown at about 1100 meters and is a mixture of SL34, Catimor, and S795. This year, they are expected to produce about 18,000 pounds of green coffee. They also have future plans to expand the farm.
 Overall it was a great first day getting introduced to Pyin Oo Lwin. There is much excitement about the possibility for specialty coffee here, and they have taken many steps to begin improving the process. We will learn more today as we move through the first round of cuppings.

 Over the years, we've been recognized by a number of local agencies and media for our great coffee. It's nice to think that people are that fond of Kaldi's, but we know that being a leader in the community isn't just about sharing a quality product, it's also about sharing your resources. For us, that has included:
 If you're interested in talking with Kaldi's about a community sponsorship or donation opportunity, please contact us.
 We don't create good coffee, we preserve it. 
 The coffee trade is long and slow. To get that fresh cup of Kaldi's coffee to taste its best, we start by sourcing the world's finest beans. That means constantly traveling to origin to find better coffees and let farmers know what we want. 
 Luckily, coffee is grown in many different places around the world. Each of these places has its own set of cultural habits regarding coffee cultivation. 
 Coffee does grow on a tree. These trees produces small, grape-sized cherries that usually contain two seeds. These two seeds are what we will eventually roast and turn into coffee "beans."
 To start with, different coffee producing regions grow different varietals of coffee that give each seed a unique flavor trait. Next, the coffee must be harvested from the trees. Picking ripe cherries instead of unripe cherries will vastly improve the final quality of a cup of coffee. Getting farmers to take this step of quality over quantity is one of the largest barriers to specialty coffee today.
 After harvesting, the coffee fruit must be removed from the seeds. This process is done in a number of ways that involves fermentation, washing/cleaning, and drying. The type of processing used gives the coffee a very unique flavor and is usually based on cultural traditions.
 Once the coffee beans are dry, they must go through a final milling process to remove a tough layer of skin surrounding the seed called parchment. The coffee is then sorted and cleaned.
 Getting coffee to Saint Louis in a timely manner after harvest is also a challenge. The fresher the crop, the more delicious the cup. We have tried to improve upon this freshness by using new shipping materials that are less prone to aging, absorbing scents, and trapping moisture.
 When the coffee finally arrives, we sample roast and cup it a number of times to determine a roast profile. Last, we do our best every day to preserve and present that quality to you.

 Sourcing at Dogwood Coffee is based on three principles: Quality, reciprocal relationships and balance. Through communication, travel and the cupping table, we find delicious coffees and awesome people to work with that mirror our philosophies about coffee and life in general.
 Quality is the driving factor behind what we do and provides expandable opportunities from the coffee farm to the brewed cup. In coffee, working for quality means access to sustainable markets and satisfaction with the work. There is little point in doing something without the drive to do it well, and in the end, we’re all interested in drinking tasty coffee.
 Relationships are fundamental to our sourcing approach. We partner with producers, exporters, importers and other sourcing pros that allow us to participate in the process and forge meaningful, longstanding relationships. We travel to the countries where coffee grows to know the places and people, and to push the process of discovery. We are not afraid to cultivate new relationships with producers who have been where we have before—trying to figure it out and do something new. Through building relationships we share in the risk of discovery and in the awesomeness of success.
 Balance runs through everything for us. Our offerings are balanced yet interesting—with wild coffees that knock your socks off and coffees you could drink all day. Balance means that we step back and try to understand what we do in a global perspective. Coffee is the livelihood of and hugely important to millions of people spanning culture and economics, but we remember that people have lives and that what happens around coffee is of equal significance.
 It is humbling to follow the process of coffee: a fruit that gets picked by hand on the other side of the world, pulped and dried, sorted and stored and sold, then put on trucks and boats to get to us. All along there are hundreds of ways something could go wrong, hundreds of factors that contribute to a delicious cup and hundreds of people intertwined. Quality, relationship and balance are on our minds as we buy coffees that help make us the company we are.
 Dogwood Coffee Company exists to support and spread the enjoyment of delicious coffee. Our participation is rooted in relationship, cultivated by discipline and grown through original expression.

 1650 - 1750 masl. In full sun.
 
							The coffee is selectively hand picked by hired pickers under
supervision of Elias. Cherries are hand sorted before they are
processed to make sure only ripe cherries are processed together.
After depulping the parchment coffee is rinsed in clean water.
Then the water is drained and the parchment is fermented for
14 to 16 hours. After fermentation the coffee is washed in clean
water that is changed 4 times. All ﬂoaters are removed during
the washing. The Parchment is soaked for 24 hours in clean
water before it is dried in parabolic dryers under shade from 25 - 35 days.						
 We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our espresso roasts are similar to our light roasts but are developed slightly more in order to reduce the intensity of acidity when brewed as espresso. This roast will give you slightly more bitter notes when brewed as a filter coffee. 
 We strongly recommend to use VST filterbaskets. Both the 18g, 20g and the 22g basket is great for our coffee.

The VST filters makes it a lot easier to extract the espresso properly which gives a lot more sweetness in the cup. They are also more or less identical to eachother which makes it easy to be more consistent when brewing on several groups at the same time.
You can buy the filters here. Just make sure they fit your machine. (Fits all La Marzocco machines and machines with 58mm filter baskets)

With the VST 18 gram filterbasket, we recommend the following brewing parameters:

18 – 19 grams freshly ground coffee
25 – 35 seconds brewing time
35 – 38 grams of final brew liquid in the cup
93°C – 94°C brew water temperature

 Eight years ago, we couldn’t have offered this coffee. It was hard enough for us to explain to people that a few particular Colombian coffees were more exciting than all the assorted grocery store coffee they had seen labeled “Colombian” for decades.
 While we were busy telling our parents why our expensive and floral and syrupy sweet Andino was really worth the effort, the farmers of Bruselas were doing their part as well. First the Andino co-op tightened up their tasting and testing, then they started sending us samples of their neighbors’ most exceptional coffees. What we’re saying is, things have really picked up over the last few years, on both the coffee production side and the coffee-drinking side.
 And now, here we are: 2016, and it’s the third year we’ve offered a sub-lot of Andino featuring the half-dozen coffees that jumped out to us. As usual, we’re paying these producers a quality-based bonus for these coffees beyond the premium prices fetched by the Andino co-op.
 Just like we told people in 2008, this coffee isn’t for everyone. It’s exceedingly tropical, held together with dense syrup and surprising complexity. In fact, there are some hungover mornings when we prefer the straightforward butterscotch flavor of the full Andino co-op to this wild coffee. But if you’re the kind of person who appreciates something rare and special, you really have to give this coffee a try. (And then another. And another….)
 
	        
	                
Every cup you drink should be exciting: a delicious representation of the region. To find these coffees, we work directly with farmers who share the same ambition and commitment for their craft as we 
do.
	        
                
 A South and Central American blend of hard-bean coffees, roasted until most of their essential oils rise to the surface. A classic roast perennially favored in Continental Europe.

							The coffee is hand picked by the farmers and their families. After delivering the coffee to the wet mill the good coffee cherries are separated from the inferior ones. The cherries are depulped and graded by using an old disc de-pulper that uses water and gravity to sort dense beans from less dense beans. The beans are dry fermented for about 12-16 hours over night in one tank, then transported to a second tank with water where the fermentation is continued for up to another 30 hours depending on the climate and amount of mucilage left. After fermentation the coffee is washed and graded in the evening before it gets  dried on african elevated drying tables, where defect parchment coffee gets sorted out. The coffee is dried to a moisture between 10-12% and stored in conditioning bins before delivery to the dry mill.						
 We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our light roasted coffees are suited for all brew methods except espresso. The roast level gives a cup with clarity, brightness and sweetness with little  bitterness and ashy flavors from the roast process.

If brewed as espresso on an espresso machine, the lighter roast style will result in a cup with a very high level of acidity due to the highly concentrated brew. We therefore recommend using our slightly darker roasted coffees for making espresso.
 All our coffees are packed in vacuum sealed, recyclable plastic bags that are flushed with nitrogen before seal- ing. The bags has a one way valve to let the coffee de-gas while quality is kept in the sealed bag.

When the coffee is roasted it develops a lot of CO2 gas inside the beans. This gas will make the coffee taste smokey and ashy immediately after roasting. It is abso- lutely crucial to let the coffee degas and rest for a while before use to ensure maximum flavour.

We recommend storing / degassing our ligher roasted coffees for minimum 3 to 5 days after the date of roast , sealed in the original bag at room temperature, before you use it.

Make sure you store it in a dark place at around 14°C - 20°C, away from any heat, moisture or light. The coffee has lost most of its sweetness and aroma 3-4 weeks after the day of roast, so make sure you use it before it is too late.

You can find the roast date and batch number on all our coffees in the bottom right corner of the front label on the bags. 
 We strongly recommend to use correct measurments and brewing techniques when you brew our coffees. Use a digital scale both to measure water and coffee in order to get consistent results.

We recommend to use between 60 to 70 grams of coffee per litre (1000g) of water, depending on the brewing method, water quality and coffee used.

 Coava travels the world in pursuit of coffees with the highest quality, complexity, and balance. We take an exhaustive hands-on approach to coffee as an agricultural process. Dedicating ourselves to learning about soil conditions, sustainable farming practices, varietal mutations, and plant diseases are only a few of the areas of specialty that have helped us source outstanding coffees.
 Each year, we spend months at origin courting the most conscientious coffee producers. We use our resources to build better processing facilities, introduce the best preservation practices, and spotlight individual farmers. We also collaborate with coffee mills to buy a farmer’s full harvest. This stands in opposition to the common practice of only purchasing parts of the harvest and leaving the farmer with the harder-to-sell remnants. Our rare approach ensures the purchase of an entire farm’s production at a higher price. We still get the top-tier separations, but we’ve also found a home for the rest of the coffees with the local coffee mill.
 We make these efforts to establish mutually beneficial partnerships with the men and women producing the coffees we adore.
 We are committed to the inherent qualities within each unroasted coffee. We strive to compose beautiful roast profiles that highlight the tremendous work that has been performed by the coffee producers each harvest. We never blend coffees and whenever possible we name them after the farmers who grow them. We are constantly tasting, documenting, and reevaluating our profiles to ensure that we enable individual coffees to shine.
 After everything has been said and done Coava is rooted in preparing exceptional beverages. Our passion for balanced & sweet espresso, perfect milk drinks, and delicious brewed coffee brings our baristas together as craftsmen. We push for consistent excellence by refining our skills through palate calibration, systematic preparation, and self-critique. This dedication has earned our team many first place honors in the Barista Competitions.
 a: given to general and cordial reception of guests
 b: promising or suggesting generous and cordial welcome
 c: offering a pleasant or sustaining environment
 At Coava’s core is the desire to share the delicious coffees that we are excited about. We never dreamed that the pursuit of such a simple goal would surround us with all of the incredible people that make up the Coava family. From our shop’s dedicated regulars to coffee lovers around the globe, we enjoy coffee together. We’ve danced and celebrated, barbequed and tinkered, but also dug in deep and supported one another.
 In similar fashion we would not be who we are without great partnerships. We problem solve harvest and processing issues alongside farmers. We help coffee shops all over the United States open, build up, and expand their businesses. We raise money and resources alongside non-profits to benefit our community. With these amazing partners Coava has been honored to grow, learn, and succeed.

 Simultaneously complex and intense; this coffee combines the jam-like, brambly qualities of boysenberry with the top-note florality of honeysuckle.
 The Gesha Cultivar is considered by many coffee professionals, connoisseurs, and enthusiasts to be the most intense, complex, brilliant cultivar ever discovered. Though Gesha gained its current acclaim from crops cultivated in Panama, its origin can be traced back to the fertile land on the slopes of southwest Ethiopia. From the birthplace of coffee, Gesha was transported across the world’s foremost coffee producing countries, finally landing on the shores of Central America in the 30s. Because of its unique traits from plant to cup, Gesha has built an unparalleled name for itself, and now we have access to the greatest cultivar ever discovered grown on some of the world’s greatest farms.
 "A place very far away and hard to get to", as defines the word "Jurutungo," is the name of Graciano Cruz' farm in Western Panama.
 In the seventies, Jurutungo was a freshly planted farm in western Panama near the Costa Rican border in a region called Piedra Candela. Jurutungo was planted with Catuai, Caturra and a modest hectare of the Gesha variety.
 In 2009, Graciano Cruz took over the overgrown farm and reinvigorated the land by stumping the existing trees and allowing them to regrow. The result; the rebirth of some of the world’s oldest gesha trees on one of the highest farms in Panama.
 A North American exclusive offering, Evelia Maria Natural Gesha celebrates "old-vine" character and terroir of one of the most intriguing farms we’ve come across to date.

 Why you’ll love it: Generations of Americans have loved Colombian coffees for their balanced and smooth flavors. The San Roque is our interpretation of this classic and popular style, with exceptional sweetness and subtle flavors of citrus, grape, and cherry.
 Story of the bean: Producers in the San Roque Association process and dry their own coffees and deliver them to quality analyst, Duver Rojas, who tastes the coffees delivered every day and pays incentives for the best coffees. Of 100 families in the association, this lot represents only ten producers who embraced these best practices. Their hard work on the steep hillsides unfolding below the San Roque Monastery and above the Magdalena River created this coffee of refined sweetness.

            The ROK Coffee Grinder is a refined and functional tool, designed to help you achieve a precise and effortless manual grind for any brew style.
          
 Requiring less than half the revolutions of a standard manual grinder, the ROK Coffee Grinder is quick, efficient and immensely easy to use, due in large part to the long handle, stable base and bevel gears with self-lubricating properties. While we love a quality electric grinder as much as the next brewer, there’s something to be said about employing a little elbow grease to achieve a precise grind, and with the ROK, doing so in about the same amount of time! It only takes about 30 seconds to grind the amount of coffee needed for a double shot of espresso. With a sleek design to boot, this grinder has got it all!

 Our coffee is decaffeinated at the Descafecol plant in Manizales, Colombia by using a specialized "combination procedure" utilizing water and ethyl acetate derived from sugar cane molasses. Ethyl acetate is an ester that is found naturally in several fruits and vegetables and Manizales is known for its many sugar cane plantations, making great use of a local product. Ethyl acetate's low boiling point enables a gentle caffeine extraction from the coffee bean, while pressure or excessive heat treatment are avoided and the natural structure of the green coffee bean cells are retained.

 To honor our long standing relationship with the Kochere Cooperative we are highlighting a dozen of their top scoring producers. These stalwarts have proven themselves through consistently delivering only the ripest of cherries. After processing and a period of rest we have the green coffee sorted for defects an additional two times longer than other lots coming out of Kochere. This Coava exclusive is named for the beautiful “blossoms” found on coffee trees before harvest.
 Black tea, honey comb, and sweet rose blossom mark the Meaza among the most delicious Ethiopian coffees we have ever tasted.

	The bean offers a sweet and delicate floral aroma mixed with flavors of peach, cherry, tangerine and tropical fruits along with subtle spices and dark chocolate. 
	
	Rodrigo Sánchez, along with his wife, Claudia Samboni, and daughter, Natlia, are the coffee entrepreneurs in charge of Finca Monteblanco. Monteblanco's name comes from its location, perched on the very top of a mountain, and often surrounded by clouds. Rodrigo has been farming coffee for almost 15 years now, and as of late, has started involvement in projects with three innovative partners in his locale, each with a complementary focus. 
Rodrigo first developed a curiosity to experiment with his coffees when he, along with Wbeimar Lasso's confirmation of nuances in cupping notes, discovered "La Caturra Purpura," or Purple Caturra. Only 26 trees out of a lot of 20,000 had this unique mutation in their development of leaf growth. Rodrigo now has now bred an entire lot of this variety in his second experimental farm.

It is farmers like Rodrigo who greatly excite us, as they are pushing our world of specialty coffee to new limits, identifying specific varieties, and experimenting with the use of current technologies to define the processing techniques these coffees deserve. This vector on the production side will undeniably call for a deepening response from roasters with the same ambition.

 At Coava Coffee Roasters, our philosophy is simple: we focus on quality, complexity, and balance in the cup. Our long term partnerships with amazing coffee producers combined with the diligent refinement of our craft has allowed our family to roast some of the highest scoring coffees in the world. We are honored to share them with you.

 Retinas burn and weak palates crumble when they see Neon coming.  Staying true to our roots, this espresso blend is bright and glows with sweetness.  In fact, we recommend wearing BluBlockers while extracting. The body of this blend is like syrup and the candy-coated finish lingers like a Minnesota goodbye. We're working hard on our end to create something crazy delicious, and now it's in your hands--a bit of patience and some effort will make this espresso explode with flavor and complexity.  Enjoy.

 We start with the highest quality coffee, cold brew it without heat for over 12 hours, then use a double filtration process to procure the end result: a complex, smooth and full-bodied brew with low-acid and a chocolate finish. Feelings of invincibility and euphoria are likely to follow.
 You don't do dairy. Say no more. We've mixed our life-affirming Cold Brew with the finest coconut cream from Sumatra, Indonesia for a dairy-free, vegan game changer.

 Our cascading and creamy Nitro Cold Brew is now available in a pop top. Pour it like you mean it into a glass or drink it straight from the source.

	Ardi is not your everyday cup of coffee...especially at Madcap. Ardi has been a staple in our line-up since 2010 and a fan favorite known for its syrupy sweetness and abundant fruit character. This enigmatic profile is the result of a specific and intentional method known as ‘dry processing’ or ‘natural processing’. With dry processed coffee, once the coffee cherry is picked, rather than removing the skin and mucilage (like is done with washed coffee), the coffee is dried with the cherry still intact, allowing the coffee fruit to raisin around the coffee seed. During this period of drying, sugars and alcohols in the mucilage and skin of the coffee fruit play a role in developing the unique character of natural processed coffees. To dry process well, however, takes a lot of work, intentionality, and an optimal climate.

	As with other Ethiopian coffees, heirloom trees grow wild in the cool, lush highland forests which are coffee’s native habitat. Ardi comes from privately-owned wet-mills, who pay individual farmers for their coffee. To assure that the coffee attains the right flavor, they sort through the drying cherries multiple times a day to pick out any under-ripe fruit. Meanwhile, the coffee is raked constantly to ensure even drying which minimizes the extent to which mildew and other molds could impart a fermented flavor to the coffee. The meticulous effort over the course of 3 weeks ensures a clean, well-structured, dry-processed coffee. Each of the coffees are kept separate from mill to mill, which provides us the opportunity to choose a specific top-graded Ardi lot we prefer year after year.

	At Madcap, we focus on clear, complex, and nuanced flavors and we rarely offer dry-processed coffee. However, each year during our summer months, Ardi is an exception. We find it to be a great example of a dry-processed coffee that is refreshing in the midst of our summer season. Ardi is the perfect coffee for someone who wants a bold, out-of-the-box, fruit-forward flavor experience.

 Initially conceived as an alternative to the erratically composed and often disappointing iced latte, our New Orleans iced coffee is cold-brewed for 12 hours with roasted chicory and sweetened with organic cane sugar. The end result is a potent concentrate that we cut with organic whole milk. It's sweet, creamy and, perhaps most importantly, consistently delicious.

 Just before you start the brewing process, grind one pound of coffee on a coarse setting.
 Add the grounds and 43 g of roasted chicory to your stockpot.
 Pour 2.5 quarts of filtered, cold water into the stockpot. Give the contents a few gentle stirs with a wooden spoon, so that all the grounds are visibly immersed.
 Cover the stockpot. Let its contents steep for 12 hours at room temperature.
 After the coffee's steeped, pour it through a fine-grained mesh sieve. Straining is easier if you first break the coffee crust with a wooden spoon. In terms of yield, look for about 4-5 cups of concentrate. As unappetizing as it may sound, the concentrate should resemble used motor oil.
 Add 85 g of simple syrup to your concentrate and incorporate it thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Serve over ice, and add milk to taste. The concentrate/milk ratio should be roughly equal. Unsweetened concentrate will last for 5-7 days. Once sweetened, it will only last for 1-2 days. Once you add milk, hustle up – it’s only excellent for an hour or so.

 This coffee has warm flavors of cinnamon, almond butter and caramel with a long finish and full body.
 Decaf coffee is a whole different animal, so we take extra care in roasting this coffee. The Swiss Water Process is a way of removing the caffeine from coffee without the use of chemicals; we feel that the process helps maintain some of the original flavors of the coffee and gives us more to work with in the roaster. Over the past year, we’ve been focusing on bringing in better tasting decafs by choosing origins we love and using higher quality coffees to put through the decaffeination process. This particular batch turned out super, it comes from the Guji region in the south where many of our tastiest Ethiopian coffees are grown.

 The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, popularly known as Proposition 65, is a California law intended to protect California citizens from chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm and to inform citizens about exposures to such chemicals.  One such chemical is acrylamide, which may be present in coffee, including the coffee sold by Blue Bottle Coffee.  Acrylamide is a naturally occurring byproduct formed when certain sugars and an amino acid react to high temperatures, such as when coffee is roasted.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not determined that the low levels of acrylamide naturally found in roasted coffee have any public health impact. Your personal cancer risk is affected by a wide variety of factors. For more information on acrylamide, please consult the FDA’s website at fda.gov.  For more information about both acrylamide and Proposition 65, please visit www.oehha.ca.gov/prop65.html. 
 All matters relating to our website and these terms and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision.  Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these terms or our website will be instituted exclusively in the federal and state courts located in Alameda County, California. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.
 (a) YOU AND BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER PRE-EXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, CONSUMER PROTECTION, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT, INJUNCTIVE AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS) BETWEEN YOU AND US ARISING FROM OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THROUGH THE SITE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION. (b) The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (”AAA”) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the ”AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this Section 12. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to arbitrability and/or enforceability of this arbitration provision, including any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge that the arbitration provision or the Agreement is void, voidable or otherwise invalid. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity. Any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you prevail on any claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys’ fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees to you under the standards for fee shifting provided by law. (c) You may elect to pursue your claim in small-claims court rather than arbitration if you provide us with written notice of your intention do so within 60 days of your purchase. The arbitration or small-claims court proceeding will be limited solely to your individual dispute or controversy. (d) You agree to an arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute, NEITHER YOU NOR BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced.
 No waiver by Blue Bottle Coffee of any term or condition set forth in these terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Blue Bottle Coffee to assert a right or provision under these terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
 If any provision of these terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these terms will continue in full force and effect.

Merging with The Northbridge Coffee Roasters’ Faculty of Espresso in late 2013, our onsite education centre is located on the next level to our operational artisan roasting facility and boasts enviable features such as eight operating commercial espresso machine workstations, alternative brewing method training areas, as well as a vast array of international coffee training resources.

 Finca Retana derives its name from Father Retana, the principal friar among the order who founded this farm a century ago. Are you expecting us to say that this coffee tastes heavenly? Because we’re not going to. Even though it does.
 We’ve been offering this coffee for many years now, but that’s nothing compared to the decades that Fernando Cofiño’s family has handled this farm. In recent years Fernando himself has spearheaded ecological sustainability and social responsibility efforts. Which again: heavenly.
 Fernando reforested over a hundred nearby acres with navel orange trees along with traditional pine. He’s also relied on old‐fashioned and unobtrusive methods in his fight against the coffee leaf rust that decimated his harvest two years ago.
 Just the very fact that Retana continues to grow low‐yielding, sweet‐tasting varieties like this is a sign of Fernando’s dedication to producing specialty coffee that’s actually special, all while retaining Antigua’s biological heritage. And that heritage means a lot to us, even if we’ve only been working with Retana for the last six of its dozens of years.
 This particular lot of Retana is a single Red Bourbon day-lot from the beginning of the harvest. We aren’t sure what made this particular lot so exceptional. We just know it’s worthy of the SMALL treatment.
 Ever since we've been exposed to "Sugar Processed" Decafs, we've fallen in love. Ethanol is used to extract a solvent found in sugarcane, which extracts the caffeine. Definitely the gentlest non-chemical decaffeination, and to boot this is done in the same country as the coffee was produced, Colombia, also a rarity in decaffeination. Honestly, this just tastes like a really beautiful coffee from Colombia, it just happens to be Decaf.
 ﻿All of our coffee is now flushed with nitrogen when bagged, creating an inert atmosphere that improves freshness. An unopened bag of coffee can now retain freshness for 4+ weeks.

 Today, SFMOMA is hosting a Topping Out event in Jesse Square park, where everyone can witness the highest beam lifted into place on their expanded building.  It’s hard to believe that over a year has passed since the SFMOMA ground breaking ceremony, where we marked the occasion with a site-specific cookie wall.   While we won’t be participating in today’s events, we wanted to share these photos taken on a shoot in July, commemorating a building that today reaches new heights, always deserving of a celebration, and happens to look great as a dessert.
 Originally, we created this layered dessert, inspired by Mario Botta’s iconic striated turret, for a press event introducing Snohetta’s plans for  SFMOMA’s expansion.  Alternating layers of black cocoa cake and whipped cream topped with a chocolate sable were diligently stacked in these perfect glass votives that Caitlin found on a whim.
 We were adamant about getting the dessert turret documented with the architectural turret it was inspired by.  So we packed up the camera, a pint of whipping cream, and a whisk and headed downtown where we whipped the cream and assembled the dessert on site.  Which happened to be outside at the fountain area just across the street from the museum we remember and love.  And now whenever I pass it, I think of all the amazing art-inspired desserts we got to make within the building, and how much fun is yet to be had outside of it.  Like whipping cream in situ.
 Two of our favorite and most frequent visitors to the rooftop coffee bar were curators of Architecture and Design, Jennifer Dunlop Fletcher and Joseph Becker.  They would come up for their morning espresso drinks, sometimes again for a meeting in the afternoon and if the timing was right, I would poke my head out from the kitchen to say a quick hello and inquire about any creative endeavors.  In their open and generous manner, they would update us on what they were working on next or who they were meeting while they waited (never too long) for their drinks. In exchange, I would usually give them a taste of what we were working on.  These brief exchanges would often turn into collaborations on a special event or a dessert.   On a tour with Jennifer through the Buckminster Fuller exhibition, as it was being installed, the creation of the Buckminster Fuller Hot Chocolate was finalized when we saw the magazine cover of the proposed floating village in a vitrine.  
 It was always a treat to correspond with people who reply to emails with enthusiasm and in some case with thoughts they might have on art that would make a good dessert.  Like these from Joseph:
 Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, ‘Dropped Cone’ (2001)
 and Le Corbusier…too architectural? But what about a chocolate meringue Ronchamp? Yum!
 This time two years ago,  Field Conditions opened.  This exhibition of “spatial experiments”, included nearly 30 works by artists and architects, and entirely in black, white and shades of grey.   For the opening event, the A+D department partnered with SFMOMA’s education team who had scheduled a program in conjunction with the San Francisco Electronic Music Festival to celebrate John Cage.

 We were already fans of Tauba Auerbach’s work, from the 2009 SECA exhibition which was up when we first opened the rooftop coffee bar, so it was no surprise that her “50/50 Floor” appealed to us.   The giant floor-tile installation, (coupled with a kinetic light installation by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer) is made of 50% black tiles and 50% white tiles, which are randomly distributed over the floor in a QR code–like pattern.  Could we do a Mondrian-style cake that when cut into could be photographed with a QR code reader and take you to a website? We dreamed in black and white.

 As the installation of the 50/50 floor neared completion, we got word at the side kitchen door that there were a few square feet of the black and white tile left.  I asked Joseph if we could use it for the event to serve the series of black and white crackers we were working.  In minutes we had them in the kitchen and started working on some spreads for the crackers.  I acquired some squid ink from our friend Stuart at State Bird Provisions and waited for Tess, (a vegan whom I care for dearly and who, I was afraid would never come back to work if she had to witness squid ink in our sweet little production kitchen), to leave for the day before I attempted to color match our house-made ricotta to the black tile.
 photo courtesy of Lanlian Szeto of SFMOMA, thankfully she took this, because it’s the only documentation we have of the whole process/event!
 Here, Tess Wilson and I are setting up what we like to affectionately call Tauba’s “Auer-crack-ers”.  We set up black and white tiles that functioned as serving plates for the crackers buttermilk (white) and black charcoal (black).  Guests were invited to choose their own spread (which we couldn’t help ourselves refer to as grout) from a selection of housemade squid ink ricotta, white bean hummus, black sesame spread and whipped ricotta.  Everyone was entertained at the thought that they were essentially “eating off the floor” and delighted to get to take their tile home as a memento.
 I just learned that today, August 26th 2014, is National Dog Day! In lieu of bombarding you with videos of cute dogs eating cake, I thought this would be a perfect occasion to share some photos of the time we made dog biscuits for humans.   Last January, the Roxie Theater screened Mike Mills’ 2011 film Beginners as part of an event for SFMOMA’s Live Projects series.As frequent SFMOMA collaborators, we set up a table at the front of the theatre to serve ticket holders New Orlean’s Iced Coffee and bags of dog treats to eat at specific points throughout the film. 
 The audience, fully caffeinated and captivated as they listen to director Mike Mills in conversation with SFMOMA’s Gina Basso about the film and his recent commission for Project Los Altos.
 In Beginners, Oliver (played by Ewan McGregor) inherits a Jack Russell, Arthur (played by Cosmo), from his father after he dies. For those who haven’t seen the film, Arthur has subtitles. This could be taken for him “talking,” but Mills suggests that the dog’s subtitles throughout the movie are “a way to externalize a character who was sometimes non-verbal.”  
 While we are huge Mike Mills fans, nothing gets our attention like a cute dog and the delight at what ensues when that cute dog “talks”:  the sound of 150 bags of cookies rustling at various points throughout a film.  
 When Design*Sponge approached me about building a photo backdrop for their book release party, I instantly arranged a meeting (drinks at Locanda) with Leah Rosenberg, my dear friend, boss, and partner-in-cake-crime. Though Leah’s an incredible painter, and I like to dabble in embroidery and flower-arranging, when we work together there’s generally baking involved. Leah’s the head pastry chef for Blue Bottle Coffee in SFMOMA’s Rooftop Sculpture Garden, and I’m her assistant, and we’re happiest when we’re working up there in our little 6'x6’ kitchen. Our brainstorming session yielded quite a few excellent, edible ideas that we would need serious grant money to pull off, but our favorite reasonable one was the notion of a wall of cookies. The Glamorous Wall Of Cookies… Guests could have their picture taken, eat a cookie, and feel at peace with the world.
 We went to work. I made a test batch of cookies just to play with sprinkles and such. I had the invaluable help of an enthusiastic 11-year-old, obviously a sprinkle & lustre-dust prodigy (she also took the photo).
 Using the random marker colors we had on hand, Leah & I did a (very, very rough) sketch of the cookie wall, to entice the Design*Sponge team. They liked it! The Glamorous Wall of Cookies was a go.
 I created a game plan in an Excel document to keep us on track. I don’t know if you can read my writing, but the only thing checked off is “Make a pointless Excel document”. 
 Next, I grabbed a piece of wood and a few nails from home and brought them to the tiny kitchen. We experimented with making holes in the cookies and hanging them from the wood, creating what I like to call The Hobo Wall Of Terror.  Don’t be scared, it’s all part of the process.
 Now that we felt confident that it was possible to hang cookies on a wall, we crunched the numbers and got started making 500 cookies. Remember: 6'x6’ kitchen. Our mixer can handle enough dough to make about 60 cookies, so we would be making 9 or 10 batches. As you can tell from her paintings and art cakes, Leah is incredibly skilled at creating and combining colors so she tinted her cookies confidently, but I still have so much to learn.
 I tinted small amounts of dough at a time, scared I would ruin an entire batch.  This actually ended up working fine, as we were so inspired by Julia Rothman’s book tour illustrations. We wanted to capture all the subtle colors she used, as well as the d*s ribbons and the gorgeous book cover.
 We rolled and cut the dough.
 We punched holes in each one (we discovered that old-fashioned paper straws worked best).
 And once all the cookies were baked, carefully layered them in Cambros, labeled with their quantity & (occasionally questionable) colors.
 All the while, the task of building an actual wall (that could hold 500 cookies and wouldn’t fall on people) loomed. We admitted we’re really more cake-bakers than wall-builders, so we outsourced to our immensely talented friend Sam of Synth Island, who whipped up an elegant, sturdy design.  The three of us took a fieldtrip to Discount Builders, where every single person working helped us. They were all patient, efficient, friendly, and truly helpful.
 We’d brought cookie “swatches” which we intended to share with all the employees….until I set them down in the wet color sample the nice paint boys whipped up for us. You see, it’s not enough to see what the cookies look like nearby the paint color- they really need to be all up in it. From the beginning, I’d been envisioning colorful cookies on a gold background- gold to reference the book cover and to add plenty of glamour. Leah gently reminded me that no paint would create the true-gold background I dreamed of- for that, we would need to gold-leaf the wall (we would still love to do this, so please contact us if you need a gold-leafed wall full of possibly edible-gold-leafed cookies. It would be gorgeous..). Instead of settling for a trying-to-be-gold-but-really-yellow effect, Leah had the great idea of using the pretty grey of the Design*Sponge website. When I put the cookies in the paint, the colors really popped, so we were satisfied.
 We found everything we needed, and loaded it up in a Zipcar (one of 4 vehicle rentals involved in this project- none of us have a car, and I don’t even have a license).
 The actual wall had to be built on the sidewalk in front of Sam’s apartment, as San Francisco apartments cannot accommodate very much lumber. Leah & I gridded out the holes for all of the nails (that took a few attempts), deciding to hang 2 cookies on each nail so the colors would change throughout the night of the party. I drilled, I broke the drillbit, she drilled, nailed, and painted, and I tried not to break anything else.  The day of the party arrived and Leah baked the hundreds of cookies in our little oven (referred to affectionately by guests as our Easy-Bake Oven). Our friend Kelly volunteered to be Leah’s lovely cookie wall assistant at the party, since I would be out of town. Excitement was running high! We love Design*Sponge, we love baking, and we love outlandish projects- I hope everyone at the event had as much fun as we did making the cookie wall!
 Here are some photos taken at the event at Anthropologie.  You can see  Blair Sneddon’s photos of guests posing in front of the wall eating their cookies here!

 We featured our Cartagena Ice Cream and Sorbet Trio in Modern Art Desserts, but didn’t get to include the story (or picture) of when we fed Alejandro Cartagena (the artist, himself!) the trio of ice creams and sorbets. He and Pablo Lopez Luz, another artist featured in the Photography in Mexico exhibition, were in town for the opening celebration, and we were delighted to invite him up to try our finalized (just in time for the opening!) dessert.
  Alejandro Cartagena and Pablo Lopez Luz eat some ice cream!
 We learned earlier on that it is best to get a sense of an upcoming show ahead of time, to talk to curators as they are planning the exhibition, to get inside scoops from the museum install crew, to make the most successful rendition of a dessert based on an artwork.  Often, extra time was needed to get the approval of the artist, or to work out serving details, or to order ribbon…from Canada. 
 But none of this mattered when I discovered one Wednesday night in April that Mary Heilmann was giving a lecture downstairs at the Wattis Theatre the following night.  Mary Heilmann  is my favorite artist. I could go on about how her work got me through grad school, but best to cut to the part about cake.
 I didn’t sleep that night – Mary Heilmann’s paintings playing like a slide show through my head – each one a possible dessert.  I thought about just going to the lecture, sitting on the edge of my seat and on her every word, but it would be a dream come true to meet her in person.  And if I met her in person, I would have to make her a dessert.  This is, afterall, why we were there doing what we did in the tiny kitchen at SFMOMA.  For moments like this. And this, and this, and even this.  
 Mary Heilmann, Fire and Ice Remix/ sketch by Leah for Fire and Ice dessert
 I had to carefully plan the following day, already packed with regular production, meetings and whatever else comes up in a day, in order to make something for Mary with the time and resources available.   Maybe all this sounds a bit crazy-making.  Or maybe, it sounds a bit like art-making.  Whatever it was, on April 11, 2013, thanks to some fancy facilitating by SFMOMA Public Programs Associate, Gina Basso, I got to meet Mary and Mary got an impromptu dessert based on her painting Fire and Ice Remix.   This Red Hot Red Velvet Cake with crème fraiche-spiked cream cheese frosting and buttermilk ice milk was made once and never again, what one might call an Artist Proof in the printmaking world,  I suppose. 
 In the time between a tech run-through and her lecture, Gina brought Mary Heilmann up to the rooftop for a cake and ice cream remix of her Fire and Ice Remix.  
 While the dessert might not have been perfect, it was eaten and now is gone.  Which thankfully, is not the case with the painting that inspired it. One week after her lecture, I received this sweet note in my inbox from Mary (herself!).  Even her emails turned to art. 
 “Leah   Thank you  again  for the beautiful  Fire and Ice Dessert…..  
 I even saved some and brought it                                                                                                               home to new york and ate it when I got home.Hey here it is I ’ll never forget   Love Mary H”
 For years, Tony Cragg's Guglie was the first artwork we would see as we emerged from the elevator and out into the SFMOMA rooftop pavilion.  For months, we had been thinking about building a striped frozen mousse using a cone shaped mold, but we had to be practical about time and freezer space.  With the Robert Frank show about to come down (and therefore our float), another ice cream based treat to replace it was on our minds.

 Sometimes the artwork would tell us what it needed to be and this time it begged us to be an ice cream cone.  In this case, the perfect flavor and hue of ice cream already existed, so it didn’t take much to call up our friends at Humphry Slocombe to send over a couple of buckets of their Strawberry Sorbet (Salted Caramel replaced this in the winter) and Malted Milk Chocolate to match the sculpture. Our true work would lie then on creating a custom cone wrapper (and eventually, on the warm days, non stop ice cream scooping).
 Here is Caitlin’s first test. Turns out some extra math was required, as we needed the stripes to match up just right.
 Where we would often find ourselves toiling away in the kitchen testing recipes, trying to get flavors and textures just right, this time we brought out the paint box to engineer a custom sleeve so we could transform what was once was a brown sugar waffle cone into… a Cragg cone!
 Before Modern Art Desserts (the book) came along, a photographer from the SFMOMA had been the primary chronicler of our desserts. Charlie Villyard, member of the installation crew and talented photographer, would come up every few months and document all of the goodies we had been making. And one of our very favorite shots he ever took was this one of our Tony Cragg ice cream cone.
 Here he is, doing whatever needs to be done to get the shot right. But quickly, before the ice cream melts!
 Since the Cragg piece was installed in the pavilion and not the main galleries, it was one of the rare occasions in which you could eat the dessert you ordered right in next to the artwork that inspired it.  An even rarer occasion was purposefully scooping ice cream directly onto the floor!
 After a visit to SFMOMA from LA, a relative of mine gave me this.  He had saved his cone wrapper, collaged it onto a photograph he took of the Tony Cragg piece and put it in a frame.
 Sometimes a sculpture inspires an ice cream cone.  Sometimes an ice cream cone inspires a collage.
 You can see the Cragg Cone (in its upright state) and the recipe on page 155 of Modern Art Desserts. And in case you want to dress your cones this summer in stripes, we made a template that you can download here.
 Today we celebrate National Ice Cream Day with a couple of art-inspired ice cream sandwiches! You can thank President Ronald Reagan, who in 1984, designated the third Sunday in July as National Ice Cream Day.  Clearly exhibiting his good sense when it comes to sweets, he carried on to proclaim the entire month of  July as National Ice Cream Month.  In the proclamation, President Reagan (who also had an affinity for jelly beans!) called for all people of the United States to observe these events with “appropriate ceremonies and activities.”

 Caitlin’s sketchbook detailing Joel Shapiro Ice Cream Sandwich recipe and flavors.
 We designed this dessert- a layer of strawberry and then lavender ice cream sandwiched between two vanilla ice box cookies (one with a black stripe and the other with a yellow stripe) for the  2011 SFMOMA Art Auction.  When SFMOMA asked us to do a special something for the upcoming art auction, we explored a few ideas before settling on this ice cream treat based on Joel Shapiro’s 2008 Untitled pastel drawing.  Earlier on, we mocked up thoughts for  Liz Larner chocolate dipped potato chips in which house-made potato chips would be dipped in a black cocoa-tobacco chocolate shell.  We considered a mondrian-style cake that reveals a colorful Mark Grotjahn burst.
 Leah’s sketchbook brainstorming desserts for SFMOMA 2011 Art Auction.
 The Joel Shapiro ice cream sandwich was a rendition of our Agnes Martin version we created  in 2010 while her paintings were on view for the exhibition, Calder to Warhol,  introducing the Fisher Collection and celebrating the museum’s 75th anniversary.  Subtle bands of cream, parchment and a glaze of creamy yellow inn Martin’s painting Wheat were translated into delicious, quiet layers of rose mastic ice milk, chamomile ice cream contained between two buckwheat biscuits. 
 Over the years, we created a few more art-inspired ice cream-focused treats, which can all be found with inspirational stories and recipes in the Modern Art Desserts book.  Hopefully there are enough of them to get you through to the end of this ice cream focused month… consider it your patriotic duty to enjoy them!
 Not long ago, I mentioned baseball in a post and assured you it would be the only time you would catch me referencing sports.  Since then,  I have attended two Giants games at AT&T park and a few days after that listened to the Mets playing the Giants in the kitchen, while I was playing with cookie dough. 
 At the stadium, watching the game live,  I had a bit of a hard time following the innings and strike outs, as I found myself more taken by the bountiful bouquets of cotton candy bouncing up and down the stairways across the stadium.  Or the way a vendor would hand a churro to a customer as if they were passing the baton in an Olympic relay.  The best , though, was the fellow, armed with a holster of whipped cream around his waist, who floated up and down our row suited with a back pack of hot chocolate.
 Surely by now you are wondering where this is going or get to the part about baseball already.  Perhaps by now you are imagining Modern Art Desserts taking their Pop Art Corn to the bleachers? Or the Mondrian Cake served up alongside garlic fries and beer?   As these thoughts fleeted around between innings, so did the image of the late San Francisco artist, Jay DeFeo flying a Giants banner from the fire escape of her Fillmore Street apartment while “The Rose” (1958–66) is removed via forklift.   
 The Jay DeFeo Trust posted this gem right as the Giants sweep the World Series in 2012 and DeFeo’s masterpiece was about to go on view at SFMOMA for her revelatory retrospective. During the exhibition walk through, one SFMOMA curator noted were DeFeo, an avid Giants fan, still with us today, you can bet she would have skipped the exhibition opening for the Giants homecoming parade. 
 Although we have yet to make desserts (marshmallows!) based on baseball bases, we did create a dessert, our version of an Ile Flottante, based on one of DeFeo’s works that we offered while it was on view at SFMOMA. 
 The Illustrated History of the Universe is an oil painting featuring a deceptively simple white disc floating asymmetrically against an impasto grey ground. Its complexity lies in how the layered textures convey three-dimensionality.  I love that you can see the artist’s handprint on the bottom left. 
 So, although I can’t give you a play-by-play of the nine innings of the Giants game I attended since my attention was drawn to other things, I can give you step-by-step instructions on how to knock this DeFeo dessert out of the park.  The photos that follow were all taken by Willa Koerner - at SFMOMA (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art).
 Step 1: sift the powdered sugar.
 Step 2: beat powdered sugar with egg whites. //  Step 3: pile the sugar + egg mixture into a piping bag- and also fold caramelized cocoa nibs into fluff before loading the mixture into the piping bag- details, details!
 Step 4: Pipe the meringues (an Ateco 808 tip is what we used).  // Step 5: Bake meringues at 200 degrees for 1 hour and let them cool in the oven overnight.
 Step 6: Dip the meringues in (all organic) chocolate magic shell.
 Step 7: Allow the shell to harden in a cool spot and remove from sheet tray.  Store in freezer until ready to serve.
 Step 8:  Spread the the creamy base (which is a black sesame creme anglaise) like you are applying an impasto layer of paint to a canvas.
 Step 9:  Float the meringue on the creme anglaise and sprinkle with charcoal sea salt.
 Step 10:  Eat, enjoy!  And then maybe take yourself to a ball game.
 When one thinks about art and tomato soup, Warhol’s screen prints of soup cans probably come to mind.
 Here is Caitlin pointing them out when we were visting MOMA during our visit to New York last spring.
 Warhol’s screen prints might also come to mind when one thinks about themes of seriality and repetition in art.  So too might Minimalist artist Donald Judd's  stack pieces that focus on “real materials in real space” and their purity of form.
 Donald Judd, Untitled, 1973; stainless steel and oil enamel on Plexiglas, 114 in. x 27 in. x 24 in. (289.56 cm x 68.58 cm x 60.96 cm); Collection SFMOMA, Purchase with the aid of funds from the National Endowment for the Arts and Friends of the Museum; © Judd Foundation / Licensed by VAGA, New York; photo: Ben Blackwell
 Last year when his painting Untitled 1962 was on view as part of the Permanent Collection exhibition on the 4th floor of SFMOMA, we made a minimalist soup in reference to the minimalist work.   Donald Judd’s birthday was last week and I wanted to make this soup for the occasion and float a candle in it, but it has been outrageously warm here and it didn’t seem right to post about a hot soup.  That said, word on the field is that Dirty Girl Farms just got their second wave of tomatoes in the ground this weekend that will be ready for harvest in August.  If you can’t wait until then, or are eager to make this soup for someone’s birthday like we were, you could use the whole peeled tomatoes by Jovial.
 The day we photographed this up on the SFMOMA rooftop last year, was a perfect day for soup. 
 And while this soup does a lousy job at holding a birthday candle it really does look like Judd’s Untitled!  Have a look for yourself!
 Epilogue:  It occurred to me that Donald Judd and Andy Warhol have more in common than repetition in art.  They also have tomatoes…or would have had tomatoes in common had we actually gone through with this Bloody Mary Jell-o we were testing in response to this savory palette self portrait. 
 This sketch by Caitlin is far more delicious than the Jell-o itself.  Trust us, eating paper would be more delicious than eating this particular Jell-o.  And although this is a place where we will share other failed attempts at creating edible artworks, this is the only time we will ever speak of this particular (and epically disgusting) Jell-o.

 THIS COFFEE WAS SOURCED BY CAFE IMPORTS
 This process is known as E.A. Sugarcane. It starts by fermenting molasses to create ethanol and combining it with acetic acid–found in vinegar–to make ethyl acetate. This is added to water, and applied to the green coffee to dissolve the caffeine completely out of the beans. The caffeine is separated from the greens and is steamed and washed with more water.
 This is truly an exceptional cup of coffee with flavors of citrus, caramel, and honey.

							The coffee is hand picked by the farmers and their families. After delivering the coffee to the wet mill the good coffee cherries are separated from the inferior ones. The cherries are depulped and graded by using an old disc de-pulper that uses water and gravity to sort dense beans from less dense beans. The beans are dry fermented for about 12-16 hours over night in one tank, then transported to a second tank with water where the fermentation is continued for up to another 30 hours depending on the climate and amount of mucilage left. After fermentation the coffee is washed and graded in the evening before it gets  dried on african elevated drying tables, where defect parchment coffee gets sorted out. The coffee is dried to a moisture between 10-12% and stored in conditioning bins before delivery to the dry mill.						
 We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our espresso roasts are similar to our light roasts but are developed slightly more in order to reduce the intensity of acidity when brewed as espresso. This roast will give you slightly more bitter notes when brewed as a filter coffee. 
 We strongly recommend to use VST filterbaskets. Both the 18g, 20g and the 22g basket is great for our coffee.

The VST filters makes it a lot easier to extract the espresso properly which gives a lot more sweetness in the cup. They are also more or less identical to eachother which makes it easy to be more consistent when brewing on several groups at the same time.
You can buy the filters here. Just make sure they fit your machine. (Fits all La Marzocco machines and machines with 58mm filter baskets)

With the VST 18 gram filterbasket, we recommend the following brewing parameters:

18 – 19 grams freshly ground coffee
25 – 35 seconds brewing time
35 – 38 grams of final brew liquid in the cup
93°C – 94°C brew water temperature

 We are happy to be working with Scott Rao to sell his books officially in Europe!  It holds it own as the most concise, and thorough book on barista training available.
 FROM THE AUTHOR: When I began in the coffee business fourteen years ago, I read every book I could find about coffee. After reading all of those books, however, I felt as if I hadn't learned much about how to make great coffee. My coffee library was chock-full of colorful descriptions of brewing styles, growing regions, and recipes, with a few almost-unreadable scientific books mixed in. I would have traded in all of those books for one serious, practical book with relevant information about making great coffee in a café. Fourteen years later, I still haven't found that book. I know many other professionals as well as some obsessive nonprofessionals would like to find that same book I've been looking for. This book is my attempt to give it to them.

REGION: Apaneca, Ataco
VARIETAL: Bourbon
FARM: Las Cruces/Jasal
ALTITUDE: 1515 M
FARMER: Jose Antonio Salaverria
ROAST: Medium+
NOTES: Honey process, 94 Points by Coffee Review

 
Our 94 point espresso returns along with it's sweet blast of caramel, brown sugar and molasses flavors. Followed by a creamy dark chocolate and orange finish, The Las Ranas will definitely get your day going! 

	Owned and operated by JASAL, the home of renowned producers Jose Antonio Salaverria, Cerro Las Ranas takes its name from a lagoon that is populated by thousands of frogs (Hill of the Frogs). 
	

	Cerro is the pride and joy of Don Jose Antonio and since the devastating Santa Ana Volcano eruption in October, 2005, he has restored the farm to pristine shape. Ripe, red cherry is picked and delivered to Las Cruces Mill where it undergoes a process pioneered by JASAL that is now becoming more and more common throughout Central America. The cherry is processed normally but the coffee is then immediately sent to the clay drying patios still covered in the sticky mucilage where it is laid out and constantly raked and turned to ensure even drying. 
	

	This process (called Pulped Natural or “Miel”,honey-processed) imparts a subtle sweetness and fruit note, lending an atypical complexity to the cup.
	

94 Points by Coffee Review

Blind Assessment:

	Complexly structured: quite sweet with a tart and bitterish balance. Honey, tangerine, dark chocolate, hints of flowers and apricot in aroma and small cup. Full, buttery mouthfeel. The short finish is sweet and gently flavor saturated; the long turns richly drying. Pronounced presence in milk: fat-bodied, chocolaty, with a hint of flowers.

 Shrubs are a delicious relic from colonial times, when fruit was preserved in an intriguing blend of sugar, vinegar, and aromatics. The resulting syrup or ‘shrub’ captures the deep sweetness of fruit harmoniously balanced by the tangy acidity of vinegar. On a recent sourcing trip to Costa Rica, we came across a stunning lot of ‘cascara,’ the cherry-like fruit surrounding the coffee seed or ‘bean.’ In lieu of discarding the intensely sweet, floral and elegant fruit (often treated as a byproduct of coffee production), we sought to share it. The result is our Coffee Cascara Shrub, produced in thoughtful collaboration with our friends at Berkeley-based, Shrub & Co.

 We bought our first roaster in 1995, set it up in the front window of our DeMun Coffeehouse, and started roasting the best coffees we'd ever tasted. Over the years, we've learned quite a bit more about this delicate process and we're happy to say we're still roasting the best coffees we've ever tasted. 
 The process starts by selecting high-quality green (unroasted) coffees from the world's best farms and co-ops. We then develop a unique roast profile for each coffee based on its taste characteristics, density, and processing type.
 Most of the coffees we roast are single origin coffees, meaning they come from one unique farm, mill, or co-op. Our goal when roasting these fine coffees is to accentuate the natural taste components inherent to each coffee. Dark-roasting a single origin coffee typically melts away the character and unique qualities for which we bought the coffee in the first place.
 We also blend coffees together to create our signature blends, like Espresso 700 and Café Kaldi. These coffees are designed to fit a specific taste profile. The blend of coffees used to achieve that taste profile will change slightly throughout the year since coffees are seasonal.
 Whether blend or single origin, each coffee is now roasted by one of our experienced coffee roasters using either our 1937 Vintage 75-kilo Probat or our 1960's era 22-kilo Probat. Both roasters are top-of-the-line and feature cast iron pieces for added heat retention and fantastic air flow abilities.
 Green (unroasted) coffee is "charged" into the roaster's spinning drum. The drum spins the coffee constantly to avoid it being burned by the bank(s) of natural-gas powered flames that heat it. The roaster is able to add or subtract heat to change the speed at which the coffee is roasted. During every roast, we monitor the temperature of the beans in the drum, the temperature of the exhaust, and gas pressure. By noting the changes in these marks over time, we can make many small adjustments to the gas pressure and air-flow to change a roast profile. Some coffees taste better with a short, fast roast, while others may come out better with a low-and-slow profile. 
 Our attention to these small details with each coffee we produce is what makes Kaldi's Coffee unique and delicious. We know you'll taste it in the cup.
 Kaldiʼs Relationship Coffees offer consumers the opportunity to take a proactive and global approach to their coffee purchasing decisions. Building on the success and wisdom of Fair Trade Certified, Kaldiʼs Relationship Coffees provide even greater transparency into the otherwise complex coffee transaction chain - from coffee grower to coffee lover.
 Our philosophy is simple: premium-priced coffees should taste premium. With Kaldiʼs Relationship Coffees, we select with our palates, ensure that our farmer friends are rewarded for their efforts, and that the coffee is grown in a sustainable, ecologically sound manner.
 The goals of Kaldiʼs Relationship Coffees are simple:
 Kosher foods are selected and prepared in accordance with traditional Jewish ritual and dietary laws. All of Kaldi’s Coffees are processed under supervision of the Vaad Hoeir of St. Louis, one of the world’s most respected kashrus agencies. While there is nothing inherently “un-kosher” about coffee in general, we invite a specially trained rabbi’s inspection of our roasting facility to ensure that our practices conform to the highest standards of cleanliness and purity. That inspection permits Kaldi’s to use the prestigious “OV” symbol  on our packaging – your guarantee that Kaldi’s Coffee meets that highest standards of cleanliness and kosher conformity. Even if you don’t observe kosher dietary prescriptions, these ancient traditions are considered by many to be among the most important food safety conventions in practice. For more information about kosher food, visit www.ovkosher.org.
 In 2001, we were one of the first retailers in St. Louis to offer certified Fair Trade Coffees. These coffees are monitored by Fair Trade Federation ensuring that at least a minimum sustainable wage was paid to the co-op at origin that exported the coffee. The Fair Trade minimum changes occasionally to reflect the economies and conditions at origin. We are happy to say that we have always and will always be paying at least this much for all of our coffees, and continue to improve upon the movement Fair Trade has started.
 Over the last few years, we have started focusing on new programs (see Kaldi’s Relationship Coffees) that reward quality and taste as well as help small farmers who may not qualify for Fair Trade certification. These coffees are typically produced by small, independent farmers and co-ops who have started to build value based on the quality of their coffee rather than a certification.
 Kaldi’s is a Certified Organic handler and processor of organic coffees and goods, meaning we buy and sell organic coffees and teas that have been grown without the use of harmful chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. In addition, and what most never realize, is that we follow a tedious and carefully-monitored set of specific operations when handling and packaging organic coffees and teas. Only then, when we follow these operations and pass our audits, can our coffee be offered as Certified Organic. Feel free to learn more via the USDA or through our certifying agent, Quality Assurance International.

 When you place an order from us, our highest priority is sending you the freshest coffee possible. You deserve it, and frankly so do our world class coffee producers and their coffees.
 If you order before noon on Monday - Thursday, your order will ship out the next day.
 If you order after noon on Monday - Thursday, your order will ship out two days later.
 For instance, if you order at 9am on a Monday, your order will ship out on Tuesday. However, if you order at 5pm on a Monday, your order will ship out Wednesday.
 If your order Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, at any time, your order will ship out on Monday.
 We ship flat rate USPS Priority Mail (or FedEx) for $2.95 on all orders under $50. Shipping is free for orders over $50! USPS Priority Mail does not guarantee a certain delivery time, but is good at hitting the delivery times provided by the map below. Generally, if you live within the continental United States you will get your order within three days. 
 We also can ship internationally and rush ship orders through FedEx. 
 When do orders ship?When you place an order from us, our highest priority is sending you the freshest coffee possible. If you place an order Monday through Thursday, we will ship your order the following day; Orders placed on Friday will ship out the following Monday. This is to ensure the coffee we are sending you is as fresh as possible.
 How to store coffee:There is great debate on whether to store coffee in the freezer, pantry, etc. Our recommendations are to store your coffee in a dry, cool, dark, and airtight place. Exposure to oxygen degrades coffee quicker and storing it outside of your freezer will ensure any neighboring ingredients don’t impose their flavor on your coffee.
 Does coffee have an expiration date?Coffee doesn’t expire, but we recommend buying coffee as often as you buy your milk, bread, and eggs (so about every two weeks or so). Stocking up on large amounts of whole bean coffee will lead to coffee being used further away from its roast date. The sooner you brew coffee from when it was roasted, the fresher it is and the better it will taste.
 Fair Trade Coffee:We have a selection of Fair Trade coffees available year round on our blends page. Sometimes, our single origin coffees will have a Fair Trade certification. All coffees we buy are bought at or above current Fair Trade prices. Our Kaldi’s Relationship Coffees are coffees with which we have a direct relationship with the coffee producer. We select coffees with our palates, ensure that our farmer friends are rewarded for their efforts, and that the coffee is grown in a sustainable, ecologically sound manner
 Return Policy:We don’t accept any whole bean coffee returns, but we'll happily replace your coffee with another selection should you not enjoy your purchase. Any merchandise bought from our website can be returned to our roasting facility within 30 days for a full refund. Please note our cafes cannot accept returns for online purchases. For more individual assistance on this, please email us at roastmaster@kaldiscoffee.com.
 What is the strongest/boldest/lightest coffee you have?Taste is very subjective. Equating roast profiles to flavor intensity only applies if you enjoy the flavor imposed on the coffee by its roast profile. For example: dark roasted coffees don’t necessarily have a stronger or bolder taste. When we roast our coffees, our goal is to bring out the inherent flavor of the green coffee we buy. That’s why our single origin coffees are all considered a light roast. We don’t want the roast profile to impose a taste on the coffee, but bring out those great, unique qualities.
 What do your flavor notes mean?Taste descriptions on our non-flavored coffees are notes that we found were most prevalent within that unique coffee and can be used as a guide on notes you may experience when brewing. None of these coffees are flavored in any way, but should be thought of as taste experiences you would find outside of coffee. For example, Ethiopian coffees tend to have a light, tea-like drinking experience, but Central American coffees generally have a nutty-like sweetness. Your experience and taste notes you pick up on will likely be different than our’s and you should use our notes as a guide to choose coffees you think you would enjoy.
 Why isn’t my favorite coffee being offered right now?Coffee is a seasonal crop and when we choose to offer coffees, we buy them at the peak of their season. Coffee crops by region vary throughout the year, so African coffees will be offered at different times than South American coffees. We only offer the best, so our current selection is among the highest quality coffees we could find at this given time.
 What coffee is in your blends?When we create a blend, we choose coffees that fit a unique taste profile. Since coffee is seasonal, we’re constantly adjusting and modifying each blend to match that taste profile based on the coffees we currently have in stock. The taste of each blend should remain consistent year round, but you may notice some subtle differences from time-to-time.
 Can I taste your coffee for free?Yes. We host a free weekly cupping at our roasting facility every Friday at 2p (holidays and some Fridays excluded) including a quick tour of our roasting facility. A coffee cupping is very similar to a wine tasting in that you will try a variety of coffees in a short amount of time. It is led by our roasting crew and a cupping is the same way we and coffee professionals evaluate coffees for purchase around the world. We'd love to have you visit us. How should I brew my coffee?There are a variety of exciting ways to brew coffee, all of which bring out unique qualities within you coffee. No matter how you brew your coffee, there are some standards that you should follow to get the best cup of coffee. We have guides for specific brewing methods available for download here.

Our Belle is our highest rated espresso blend with a 94 points by coffee expert Kenneth Davids of Coffee Review. Ken tried 40 espressos and rated over 30 espresso blends, placing Belle on top.
	

	Davids described the espresso by Klatch Coffee as: "Intense aroma: brandy, chocolate, caramel. In the small cup medium in body but smooth in mouthfeel, crisply pungent yet caramelly sweet, with a tightly knit, understated complexity: brandy, caramel, cedar and flowers, hints of which persist in the roundly rich finish. Masters milk with a gentle, brandied chocolate authority."

 Red Plum / Tarragon / Prosecco
 The Highlands of Papua New Guinea are stocked with challenges toward quality coffee production. Due to the immense diversity of indigenous tribes, many of which had no interaction with the western world until the 1930’s, there are over 800 distinct languages spoken throughout the country. The majority of mills that still operate were originally installed on massive commodity grade plantations in the 1920’s with seeds from Jamaica’s Blue Mountain. Today, 85% of coffee is grown by smallholder farmers, each owning anywhere between just a couple to a couple hundred trees.
 Kunjin operates a mill they lease on one of the original 15 coffee plantations, but purchases cherry from substance farmers in the Waghi Valley. They are able to control quality throughout the milling process, cupping day lots and building micro lot level containers to be processed separately.
 Kunjin is a beautifully complex and dynamic. Ripe plum initially comes to the forefront, offset by lime zest and a bouquet of sweet herbs. As it cools, the cup maintains its liveliness and picks up notes of white grape, coming together into a beautiful winey finish. This coffee is the highest quality lot we have seen from PNG, if not all of the Asian-Pacific region, and just may reshape your impression of the region. It is the perfect coffee for pairing with buttery pastries, whether sweet or savory.

 Yellow Bourbon is a natural cross between Red Bourbon and Amarelo de Botacuto, which is labelled as a Typica variant with yellow fruit. Bourbon resulted from selections made by French botanists in wild Yemeni coffee groves. Moved to controlled fields for propagation, the relatively humble stock produced a remarkable variety and was given the namesake of its nursery - Bourbon Island - upon its introduction to South American. Under expanded cultivation in Brazil, a yellow mutant with a unique flavor profile expressed itself and was isolated, expanded, and named for its color.
 This Variety Select lot comes to us courtesy of five small farmers from the villages surrounding the municipality of Iquira. With volcanic soil, anaverage temperature of 20-25° C, and 160 CM of annual rainfall, this area is extremely conducive to the cultivation of coffee. Generally, these farmers are processing only ripe cherries the same day of harvest using a dry fermentation of 18-24 hours. The coffees are then washed, and dried in parabolicos for an average duration of 12-18 days.

 This is a wild summer blend - joining coffees from two of our favorite origins: Ethiopia and Kenya. Both with distinct flavor characteristics, the washed Ethiopia Guji provides the base with a silky body, lemon and light peppermint flavors. Kenya Karagoto brings this blend’s summery brightness with fresh sweet tomato and mango punch. The days are long now, which means you need MORE COFFEE! Brew Dog Daze in the morning to get going for a day of canoeing, swimming and laying on the beach day drinking. Make a little more in the afternoon to keep you going through all the hot summer night partying. Also, relieves itchy mosquito bites.*

 Reko is consistently one of our favorite coffees year after year, and 2016 is no exception. Beautiful rose and blackberry, a gentle but bright acidity, this is as lovely of a fresh crop Yirgacheffe you could ask for.
 Cultivar: Local Heirloom, KurumeRegion: Yirgacheffe, EthiopiaProcess: washedOur roast days are Monday and Wednesday. All coffee is roasted to order and ships one day after the day it was roasted.
 ﻿All of our coffee is now flushed with nitrogen when bagged, creating an inert atmosphere that improves freshness. An unopened bag of coffee can now retain freshness for 4+ weeks.

 To honor our long standing relationship with the Kochere Cooperative we are highlighting a dozen of their top scoring producers. These stalwarts have proven themselves through consistently delivering only the ripest of cherries. After processing and a period of rest we have the green coffee sorted for defects an additional two times longer than other lots coming out of Kochere. This Coava exclusive is named for the beautiful “blossoms” found on coffee trees before harvest.
 Black tea, honey comb, and sweet rose blossom mark the Meaza among the most delicious Ethiopian coffees we have ever tasted.

 El Meridiano is the name of this coffee from the "Asociacion de Productores de Cafe Especial del Alto Saldana" or ASOCEAS. This lot represents the highest quality day lots from about 58 growers in the Tolima region in west-central Colombia. Most of the growers have modestly sized farms and wet mill their coffee with small, sometimes hand cranked depulpers. Coffee is fermented with traditional methods and dried on rooftops or in small greenhouses. Because of the climate of this region and the proximity to the Equator, Tolima generally has two harvest seasons.

 Creating a blend to achieve a particular flavor profile can be very exciting. It allows us to cup samples from all over, with the goal of finding the perfect coffee, or coffees, to suit our needs. In doing so for The 1950 Blend, we seek heirloom, varietal coffees from the birthplace of coffee: Ethiopia. These coffees are some of the most nuanced, and complex coffees on the planet and can shape-shift from region to region, processing, and through roast application.

 This sampler pack includes 2.5-oz tubes featuring three of Todd's favorite coffees from around the world.
 Haiti - For Haiti: Not only does this coffee taste delicious and refreshing when brewed hot or cold, it also represents a commitment to support and nurture the Haitian coffee industry.
 Ethiopia - YirgZ: Yirg for Yirgacheffe, Z for zero defect. Ethiopian coffees from the Yirgacheffe region are world-renowned for producing distinctively floral and aromatic coffee. "Zero defect" means this coffee is triple sorted by size, color, and density until it reaches a point of near perfection. This new harvest is on a new level of coffee obsession. The mountains and soil of the Yirgacheffe region are known for producing coffees with floral and citrus aromas. Our importing partner, Samuel Demisse, has amplified this reputation by employing a rigorous sorting process in Ethiopia.
 Brazil - Blue Diamond: In the 1940s, coffee consumption was beginning to soar and Brazilian coffee producers struggled to find a coffee tree that could withstand the strong winds and rain in the tropical savannas south of the Amazon. The solution was a hybrid plant called Catuai, a highly productive dwarf variety prized for its sweetness. With rich chocolate flavor and a full body, the Blue Diamond is a shining example of a Brazilian Catuai.

 The AeroPress is a coffee making system ideal for travel, or brewing a small amount at the home or office. It makes a very clean, sediment-free cup in a short period of time, and it is easy to clean up. You just need ground coffee, hot water, and a mug (ideally you brew directly into a mug, not included in the kit).
 Brewing with the AeroPress gives good control over the variables - you can easily adjust the water temperature or water-to-coffee ratio to change the results. In my tests, the cup results match both the full pot Technivorm brews and my cupping results (the process where we mix grinds directly with water and use a spoon to taste many coffees at once.)
 Here is an instructional video with more info on brewing with this!
 A lot of our coffees are prepared quite nicely with this method. It does add a bit more body to the coffee than a v60 does.

 Our latest version of Streetlevel Espresso made up of two incredible fresh crop coffees from Guatemala.
 Finca Candelaria is in the Alotenango region of Guatemala. In the past, coffees that came from Alotenango used to be labeled simply as Antigua because of its close proximity to the old town. Candelaria and other farms have created traction which has allowed for Alotenango to be seen as more than just Antigua's neighbor.
 Our stunning lot of Candelaria was hand-selected by our green coffee team by cupping through multitudes of day lots from the estate. We chose only late-harvest lots that were filled with dense stone fruit character. These lots come from the highest portion of the farm and are made up of Bourbon and Caturra varieties.
 The other component in our newest installment is a coffee called Los Santos. The coffees that make up Los Santos come from smallholder farmers in the Chimaltenango region of Central Guatemala. These farmers typically hold land between one hectare and 10 hectares. This specific region of San José Poaquil is fairly untapped, and most of the farmers have let their farms go wild. But, with immense potential, heirloom red and yellow bourbon trees and some guiding hands, the farmers are starting to receive premiums based on cup quality, which will quickly help the region's farmers understand its potential.
 Streetlevel Espresso works perfectly as your everyday espresso or as a brewed coffee. This version we have been liking pulled fast and medium in output.

			With each blend, we hope to achieve that unattainable quality, that little something extra that otherwise cannot be found in a coffee.
			
 Cupping notes : Ample-bodied, Forest floor, Licorice
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Breakfast Blend combines distinctly spicy and mildly pungent characteristics of Indo-Pacific coffees. The result is an eye opening blend that is bold yet well rounded, and profound flavors that are sure to illuminate your mornings.
 Cupping notes : Complex, Dynamic, Blueberry
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Elysian refers to a state of bliss or happiness, simply put – heavenly. The Elysian Blend can be characterized as a very rich, full bodied blend with a lot of depth and complexity in flavor. This makes it a good after dinner coffee to enjoy with dessert.
 Cupping notes : Deep Smokiness, Browned Butter, Caramel
Roast level : DARK
 We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as baker’s chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.
 Cupping notes : Smooth smoke, Caramelized sugar, Silky body
Roast level : DARK
 This is our darkest Fair Trade/Organic certified blend. We thoughtfully selected the coffees that make up this blend in order to maintain some of their individual aroma and flavor attributes while standing up to the intensity of the unique way that we roast them. The result is a dark roasted coffee with sweetly smoky flavor, light body and just a glimmer of lemony citrus notes; a perfect way to ease into your morning and a great complement to an evening meal.
 Cupping notes : Chocolate, Caramel, Butterscotch
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Whether approaching by sea or from within the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Strait imbues a sense of magic and wonder. The stunning landscapes and picture perfect sunsets inspired us here at Mr. Espresso to create a blend that attempts to capture its grace and majesty. Dark chocolate, sweet caramel and fruit toned acidity seamlessly blend together to create our homage to this wonder of nature.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 There are seven bridges that keep the people of the Bay Area connected, and the Seven Bridges Blend pays homage to the diversity of people and tastes in the San Francisco Bay Area.
 A blend of Fair Trade and organic certified coffees, the Seven Bridges Blend is a velvety bodied blend with depth and a complex, multilayer flavor dynamic. A favorite among customers and chefs alike, this blend can be found at some of the finest dining establishments around the San Francisco Bay Area.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Silky, Subtle fruit tones
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Countless cafés along the Viennese streets have loaned out their tables to some of the finest thinkers of our time and some of the greatest works of art, politics and philosophy found their inspiration accompanied by a rich cup of coffee. Here at Mr. Espresso we took inspiration from this legacy of creativity when we came up with our Viennese Blend. A combination of our finest dark and light roasted Latin American coffees come together to create a rich, smoky cup with low toned fruit notes and a silky mouth feel.
 Cupping notes : Sweet Chocolate, Vanilla, Cherry
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Named after the restaurant that Carlo’s brother Franco Di Ruocco owned, Ristorante Villanova (Oakland circa 1980) – and the house blend that was served there. Its mild intensity embodies the essential characteristics of a classic American roast, yet reflects our passion for traditional, wood fired roasting. The Villanova House Blend is sweet enough to serve as a dessert coffee and mild enough to enjoy throughout the day.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Smoky, Low-toned acidity
Roast level : DARK
 The choice to use water processed decaf coffees for our Decaffeinated French Roast was necessitated by our desire to deliver our customers a delicious dark roast without caffeine or compromise. A silky mouthfeel and low-toned acidity enables the rich smoky flavor to linger without interruption through the long, resonant finish.
 Cupping notes : Smooth, Well balanced, Medium body
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 This is a blend of water processed decaffeinated Latin American coffees combining to make a smooth, full flavored coffee with medium body and well balanced acidity.
 Cupping notes : Caramelized sugar, Fruit notes, Silky mouth feel
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 This is a blend of African and Indonesian beans decaffeinated by a water process developed in Switzerland, which is considered the most natural method of decaffeinating coffee. Decaffeinated Elysian Blend is a hearty and full flavored blend, which is most unusual of water processed coffees.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Modeled after our Organic Seven Bridges Blend, this coffee has all the positive characteristics of the Organic Seven Bridges Blend without the caffeine. A good alternative for after dinner enjoyment or simply for those who are caffeine sensitive. The coffee is 99.9% caffeine free.
 We ship freshly roasted coffee Monday - Friday. Get your order in by 12pm on weekdays, and have your coffee shipped the next day!

REGION: Kayanza
VARIETAL: Bourbon
FARM: Mpanga Washing Station
ALTITUDE: 1800-2000M
FARMER: Jean Clement
ROAST: Medium
NOTES: #1 & #3 in Cup of Excellence, Washed

 
A clean, rich cup that brings out flavors of subtle spice, sweet cocoa with bright tangerine acidity and plum body, giving a unique and memorable drinking experience. 

	Located in the Kayanza region, Mpanga washing station is among the most well recognized producers of complex, clean specialty coffee in Burundi. Mpanga has garnered high scores in the Burundi Cup of Excellence, including 1st and 3rd place in the 2014 COE. The washing station was built in 2008 under the initiative of Jean-Clement Birabereye, who manages the mill  and represents the farmers through the trading company SEGEC (Societe General d'exploitation et d'exportation du Cafe). Jean-Clement boasts an incredible resume, with more than 15 years of experience in milling.  Through SEGEC, Birabereye offers a premium to producers whose coffees place in competition, motivating farmers to meticulous harvesting and agricultural practices. The station processes cherry from 300 families with plots of 10-50 trees on average, though a handful have more than 100. Mpanga is equipped with 450 drying beds, six disc McKinnon pulping machines and two pressers.  Total production is about 1,500 tons of cherry per year.

No organic certification is currently held by farmers due to cost, although they planting process and maintenance of farms are organic by default. The station prides itself on paying above market price for cherries to encourage high quality production at each harvest.

	Our standard shipping option is a $6 flat-rate through UPS SurePost.
 
	We offer other options through UPS Ground that are calculated during checkout for quicker transit time. 
 
	We roast Sunday through Thursday. Once you place your order, you can expect it to be roasted and shipoed within 48 hours. Orders placed closer to the weekend may have to wait longer.
 
	Delivery time for UPS SurePost is dependent upon how far you are from Grand Rapids, Michigan but is anywhere from 1-5 days. We also offer 3 Day Select, 2nd Day Air and Next Day Air if you need your coffee to arrive sooner. Place your orders accordingly! Once your order is shipped you will recieve an email with your tracking number. 
 
	We do! If you have questions regarding your international order please feel free to email us at roast@madcapcoffee.com before you place your order.
 
	Of course you can. We strongly encourage you to grind your own coffee to achieve an optimum flavor experience but we will grind coffee on request. Select the appropriate grind in the shopping cart.
 
	All of our coffees are given a roast level that we feel brings out their best flavor. For us, roasting goes beyond color, which is why we focus more on sharing flavor profiles rather than information on the roast itself. The majority of our coffees are somewhere in the medium-light to medium roast range.
 
	We are happy to answer, neither. We've developed a way of sourcing coffee that we really believe in and that we feel, at least for us, works better than Fair Trade or Direct Trade. Madcap spends time every year visiting our producers and building relationships on the farm level. We work closely with every link in the supply-chain to ensure that quality and sustainability are top priorities. When buying coffee from farms we haven't yet visited, we use well-established organizations to assist with sourcing that are aligned with our core beliefs and interest in transparency. So in essence, our coffees are both fairly traded and directly traded, just not certified.
 
	Like all produce, coffee is seasonal. With our sights focused on quality, we purchase our coffee during harvest and only feature it while it lasts, usually about three or four months. We know it can be frustrating to fall in love with a coffee and then have it soon disappear, but think about how exciting it will be next year when its season rolls back around.
 
	Simply use the bag your coffee comes in, keeping it rolled up tightly and out of the sunlight. We encourage you to use your coffee within one month of the roast date and keep it away from the freezer. Every time you freeze your coffee a Madcap barista loses a tip.
 
	There are numerous ways to make coffee and no single way is correct. But here's some main pointers:
	1. Use filtered water. Water makes up 90% of your final product, so water quality plays a huge role.
	2. Make sure your water is between 200-205 degrees Fahrenheit. This is necessary to properly extract the awesome flavor.
	3. Grind coffee fresh right before brewing.
	4. Use roughly 10 grams of coffee for every 5 ounces of water.
	5. Have fun and drink responsibly!

 Todd Carmichael and JP Iberti founded La Colombe on a simple but profound premise: America Deserves Better Coffee. By sourcing and roasting with care, and borrowing on ancient and modern coffee traditions from around the world, the two have built a successful company and an elevated coffee experience for Americans. Through 20 years of hard work and innovation, the two have made sure that experience is shared in cafes and homes across the country.
 Todd Carmichael has lived and breathed coffee for over three decades. By pressing the limits of taste, service, and most notably, coffee sourcing – visiting the world’s developing countries to responsibly gather the planet’s best coffee – Todd has converted the nation’s culinary elite into La Colombe drinkers. Along the way, he has made his company the country’s leading coffee roaster while managing it philanthropically.
 JP Iberti is the craftsman behind the company's urban-industrial café spaces, and artisan breads and pastries. Trained in a classical Italian café setting and transplanted into Seattle’s emergent 1980s coffee scene, JP became entranced with the craft of roasting coffees beautifully. He abandoned an early career as a pilot to pursue the other machine that fascinated him—the coffee roaster. To this day, JP says that roasting coffee requires many of the same skills—attention, care, finesse—required to properly operate an aircraft.

 Syrupy, sweet and jammy; Our favorite things about Santa Barbara Hondurans intersect with our favorite things about espresso in this offering that melts faces whether on it’s own, or accompanied by milk.
 “I’ll never stop learning and improving in high quality every day”, told Oscar Edgardo Tinoco to the Cup of Excellence following his 2014 #14 finish. Since his first year entering his coffee into the Cup of Excellence, Tinoco is an example of how commitment to quality can change a coffee producer’s life.
 Tinoco is a 3rd generation coffee farmer. He was given his own parcel of farmland from his father when he was just 17 and it wasn’t long before he’d taken over his father’s farm, Pino de Oro, on loan. Having heard of the Cup of Excellence on the radio, he was determined to enter Pino de Oro into the competition and first did so in 2009.
 7 years, three top-ten Cup of Excellence finishes, a new car, a wet mill and a dry mill later; Edgardo Tinoco is debt-free and continues to grow his production of high-quality coffee alongside his wife, Nora, and three sons. for. Farmers deliver ripe, sorted cherries to Beneficio Bella Vista where they undergo a long, cool fermentation and thorough washing before being dried on raised beds.
 Looking to accentuate the decadent flavors of Edgardo Tinoco Single Origin Espresso? We recommend these specs to start with.

 Ever since we've been exposed to "Sugar Processed" Decafs, we've fallen in love. Ethanol is used to extract a solvent found in sugarcane, which extracts the caffeine. Definitely the gentlest non-chemical decaffeination, and to boot this is done in the same country as the coffee was produced, Colombia, also a rarity in decaffeination. Honestly, this just tastes like a really beautiful coffee from Colombia, it just happens to be Decaf.

 Layered with tropical fruit and black cherry flavors, Leonicio Castellon's coffee is dense, complex and jam-like.
 Another quintessence of a Farmlevel producer, Leonicio Castellon has been farming in San Luis, Honduras for 10 years. His sizable farm is just off a main road as you leave the town of San Luis. 
 This is the second year he is putting the effort into producing specialty coffee and separating all of his Catuai from the lower quality Lempira variety. Though more labor and for a lower yield, the premiums he receives for outstanding cup quality are well worth the hard work. In addition to separating his varieties he is also using less herbicides and, rather, picking the weeds in the farm by hand. 
 Last year he built his first solar drier on his farm to dry his coffee. The drier is sophisticated and going to be a perfect accompaniment to his farm. It will allow him to control the speed of his drying even more and produce repeatable results.

        Coffee is about pleasure. It’s that moment when your hand is warmed by the mug, you bring it up to your nose, inhale deeply and then take a sip.
      
 
        That sip is the culmination of years of work, three-thousand mile journeys, and passion. Here is how we make that sip perfect.
      
 
        While you are holding that cup of coffee, close your eyes. Open your mouth slightly. Breathe in deeply through your nose.
      
 
        You are smelling the most complex thing humans consume. When people talk about the flavors of coffee — notes of orange, or hints of clove — it’s because those organic molecules are contained in the coffee bean. If a coffee reminds you of apple pie, it's because coffee shares some of the same components as food, like lactic and malic acid.
      
 
        Inside that small bean are the same natural components that make flowers smell so lovely, the same ethers that let you know when a piece of fruit is ripe. Coffee has twice as much going on, molecularly speaking, as red wine.
      
 
        When tasting coffee, try waiting for it to cool down a little — you’ll be able to taste (and smell) the most when it’s the same temperature as your body.
      
 
        Flavor only matters in the context of you. What do you like? What does this scent remind you of? Are you looking for a full-bodied cowboy co
        ffee, or a delicate, tea-like finish? Chocolate aromas, or hints of jasmine?
 
        Don’t worry if you can’t describe it precisely, or have a different perception than someone else. Even when you can’t put it into words, you’ll know what you like.
      
 
        You experience the full flavors of the coffee bean if and only if nothing has gone wrong during…
      
 
        There is one right way to roast coffee.
      
 
        Someone stands by that roaster, all day, a person who knows exactly how to bring the best out of every bean — that ideal ratio of sweetness to acidity, that balance — because he or she has been doing this for years.
      
 
        Again and again, they repeat the same motion: pull a tiny sample of the beans. Stare at them, looking for the tiny signs of perfection. Smell them deeply. Put them back. Pull out some more beans. Stare. Smell. Five seconds later, repeat the process in a meditation that last hours. Do that hundreds of times a day. Do that every day for years.
      
 
        Know every bean on a personal level. Adjust times and temperatures throughout the day, knowing that 15 seconds could make the difference between letting this bean shine and overwhelming it. Know that in the morning, the roaster is cold. Know that in the evening it’s hot, and you should probably shave 45 seconds off that roast.
      
 
        Roast just enough to bring out the best and full potential of what’s inherent in each particular coffee already. Roast to draw out things like acidity, floral notes, chocolate, molasses, and earth. All of the coffee’s flavor potentials are presented at the first crack – an audible signal that happens at a particular point when roasting coffee. After that, roast just enough to add the right amount of body and sweetness, without degradation.
      
 
        Roasting different coffees as though they’re the same? Not going to work. Roasting for color, not taste? Never this.
      
 
        Please don’t burn those beans. They’ve been through so much. They’ve come all the way across the world.
      
 
        The best coffee grows in the most remote places. There is a thin band that goes around the world near the equator. Within that band, you need mountains, thick old-growth forest and just the right microclimate. Set aside up to four days to get there.
      
 
        On your way there, you’ll pass through Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport, or you’ll stand in the endless security line at New York’s JFK en route to distant parts of Ethiopia, Colombia, Indonesia and 10 other countries around the world.
      
 
        You’ll also experience 8 vaccines (the malaria pills—which can cause hallucinations and nightmares—are the worst), a passport that fills up with handwritten visas, bumpy eight-hour van rides, granola bars and in at least one case, eating the heart of a bull that has been slaughtered in your honor.
      
 
        The Green Team members, named for the color of coffee beans before they are roasted, don’t do it the easy way, which would be buying bulk, mid-quality beans at a trading floor in a capital city. Instead, they go right to the source of the best coffee — that farm or washing station high atop a distant Ethiopian hill. It ends when they arrive at that distant farm, washing station, factory or mill. They sit down in a home or around a campfire to talk about this year’s crop with a producer they have met many times. They get to work.
      
 
          In Colombia, if you go to four farms you will get four bowls of sancocho, which is this soup with chicken, yucca, plantains, potatoes, corn, avocado. Basically, it’s as many calories as you can cram in a bowl.”
        
 
        The Green Team visits every producer as often as possible, sometimes up to three times per year. They constantly roast and taste the coffee, and they form long-term, lasting partnerships with the producers. They’ll help them implement a new farming technique that could lead to even better coffee. Or they’ll teach a seminar on a new way to process coffee cherry, which is the fruit of the coffee tree surrounding the seed or bean.
      
 
        They routinely pay producers up to four times what they could get for their crop on the commodity market, but in return, they ask for a lot more work—hand picking each cherry at ideal ripeness, or implementing a new piece of equipment.
      
 
        The Green Team also identifies potential future producers—maybe this side of the mountain has just the right climate, but the quality level isn’t there yet. Stumptown will invest in that farm, or mill, or factory if that producer is willing put forth effort to get the beans to the level the Green Team looks for. It’s a partnership, and there is prestige and pride involved. For a producer, selling to Stumptown means something.
      
 
        Above all, they want to help farms become sustainable and to set up strong businesses that build up their communities and produce the highest-quality coffee possible year after year.
      
 
          Our partners are much more than farmers, they are coffee production experts, constantly innovating practices in planting, harvesting and processing the best coffees around.”
        
 
        We don’t buy in bulk on a trading floor. We buy directly from the people who are making the coffee. It’s not a transaction; it’s a partnership. If someone is growing the quality of coffee we’re interested in, then we will help them in any way we can. That means regular visits (even though that trip can take up to four days), implementing new techniques and equipment, and forming long-term partnerships.
      
 
        We shoot for sustainability, and not just in the environmental sense. A sustainable coffee producer is someone who is paid fairly for their incredible work and who can in turn encourage others to follow in their footsteps. A sustainable producer innovates, develops and improves cultivation and in turn can fetch even higher prices from Stumptown. The more each side of the partnership puts in, the better the coffee gets.
      
 
        We don’t call them farmers, we call them producers, which gives credit to the fact that they are production experts. They are the ones who make this coffee great. They are the ones who are like-minded, who will go the extra mile for quality, whatever that means.

          Producers are the heart of what makes great coffee.
        
 
          Their skills, expertise and craftsmanship is the difference between mediocre coffee and coffee that is like nothing you’ve ever tasted before. The coffee will never get any better in quality once it lands in our hands, after all. We rely on the producers for that pristine bean. A good roaster works tirelessly to preserve that coffee’s inherent greatness.
        
 
          The producers grow the coffee trees. They pick the cherry when it is perfectly ripe. They remove the outer fruit, leaving just the bean covered in a thin parchment. They rest the beans, let the beans develop into their full selves.
        
 
          Everyone on this page does something slightly different — he may tend a small patch of coffee trees on the farm he inherited from his grandmother; she may oversee the cherry soaking in a big tank of water, fermenting at just the right rate.
        
 
          They live on four continents. They speak at least 30 different languages. Some use traditional methods that are centuries old; some have taken out four-year loans to get that new top-of-the-line piece of equipment that will lead to a greater, cleaner cup.
        
 
          It’s not the easy way. It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way, and it creates the best coffee possible.
        
 
        Coffee is a tree, and you probably prefer one branch to another, even if you don't know it yet.
      
 
        There isn’t one kind of coffee, there’s a coffee family tree.   For hundreds of years, humans have been cultivating, hybridizing and perfecting it, and today there are hundreds of types, or varieties.
      
 
        The variety of coffee tree matters—or at least, it usually does. Just as different types of grapes yield different wines, the variety of th
        e bean can have a profound impact on the finished cup.   
 
        There are hundreds of varieties, and we’ve chosen roughly a dozen that we find truly special. But here are the first ones you should know.
      
 
          So sweet, so complex and so delicate, this is the pinot noir of coffee. The plants are fragile and don’t produce as much cherry as some other varieties, but they’re worth the effort. A cup of Bourbon-type variety is lush and classic. It’s the coffee of coffee. It charms the snob and the rookie alike. And no, it has nothing to do with the delicious brown adult beverage, though we at Stumptown are big fans of that kind of bourbon, too.

          This is an offshoot of of the Typica family, which is delicate, floral, at times even citrusy. This variety was brought to Indonesia in the late 1600s by Dutch traders. We love it for its nuances and high, fine acidity. Villalobos in particular brings strong flavors of stone fruits like apricots, peaches and plums.
        
 
          The beauty of these is in their mystery. They are the wildflower varieties, descended from the natural coffee forests of southwestern Ethiopia. Each village has its own variety, handed down over centuries and shaped by the soil, elevation and weather.
        
 
Related: All of them, really but these in particular: Typica, Gesha

 
          Think of Gesha as coffee from an alternate dimension. It's like a Szechuan peppercorn, or the Sun Ra Arkestra, complex and otherworldly. It’s as far as it could be from diner coffee, a delicate, black-tea body, with a zest of bergamot. Gesha is picky—it will only grow when, where and how it wants, in tiny microclimates. But whether you grow it in Indonesia or the Americas, it is always thoroughly itself.
        
 
Related: Nothing. It’s in its own orbit.
        
 
        Which, finally, brings us to the very beginnings of coffee…
      
 
        Ten thousand years ago, the Coffea trees grew wild and tangly on the mountain slopes of southwestern Ethiopia.
      
 
        There, you can still find people performing traditional coffee ceremonies many times a day—one woman will prepare it for the circle of her friends and family who stand around her. She roasts it in a pan, grinds it, pours hot water over it, serves it in the predetermined social order.
      
 
        The Dutch traders, enamored of this tradition, brought cuttings of the plants to Indonesia. French missionaries, who also saw the beauty in this hot, euphoric brew, spread it throughout Africa and across the sea to the Americas.
      
 
        Today, coffee trees are cultivated in every hemisphere on four continents. In 70 countries, you will find those shrubs and their cherry. You’ll also find find the farmers who tend them, the pickers who select them, the processors who obsessively convert fruit to bean. You’ll find the roasters who delicately transform them, and you’ll find the coffee drinkers.
      
 
        You’ll find the earliest riser in the backpacking crew that stokes the fire and sets the water on to boil. You’ll find the barista who pulls the first shot of the morning for the go-getter. You’ll find the group of 70-year-old men in the diner at 6 a.m., spending hours discussing the issues of the day over their bottomless cups.
      
 
          Drinking coffee is a pleasure. Coffee drinking is fun, and it feels good, and every once in awhile I remember that we’re actually cultivating pleasure. Why do you put anything in your mouth? Because it’s delicious.”
        
 
        Everything that came before—the shrubs, the farmer, the journey across the sea, the hybrids and the mutations—is for this moment. Because the only thing required for the smallest, quietest and most personal of coffee ceremonies are some good beans and a way to brew.
      
 
        You’ll hold that mug possessively. You’ll inhale deeply. And then you drink.

 French press coffee is dense and heavy. Though it’s sometimes criticized for being chalky, we think that a well-prepared French press is actually quite pure. But be careful: Of all methods, French press is perhaps the most vulnerable to over-extraction. For this reason, it’s necessary to transfer the entire contents of your pot to a cup or carafe immediately after it’s finished brewing.

 Bring to a boil enough water for your French press. For a 17-oz. press, you'll need about 400 grams.
 While the water is heating, grind your coffee. French press coffee calls for a coarse, even grind. We recommend starting with a 1:10 coffee to water ratio. If you're using 400 grams of water, you’ll want 40 grams of coffee.
 To start, gently pour twice the amount of water that you have coffee, onto your grounds. For example, if you have 40 grams of coffee, you’ll want to start with 80 grams of water.
 Give the grounds a gentle stir with a bamboo paddle or chopstick. If it helps, visualize gentle canoe paddling. Let the coffee bloom for 30 seconds.
 Add the rest of your water and place the pot’s lid gently on top of the grounds. Do not plunge yet. Let the coffee steep for four minutes. Four. Don’t guess.
 Gently remove your french press from the scale and place it on your counter. Press the filter down. If it’s hard to press, that means your grind is too fine; if the plunger thunks immediately down to the pot’s floor, it means your grind is too coarse. The sweet spot, pressure-wise, is 15-20 pounds. Not sure what this feels like? Try it out on your bathroom scale. We have. When you’ve finished pressing, serve the coffee immediately. Do not let it sit, as this will cause it to continue brewing.
 It’s no secret that good coffee fails without great brewing methods. There are a few basics that all good brewing methods must possess:

  "It’s now the third year that were buying the coffee from Kamwangi Factory in Kenya. Personally I think that the creaminess in the cup stand out, with a lot of acidity reminiscence of pink grape fruit. This year we’re buy both the peaberry and the AA selection of the coffee, this one being the AA meaning the larger bean size.” /Joanna Alm, Head roaster 
 The coffee cherries are hand sorted for unripes and overripes by the farmers before they go in to production. The pulp (cheery) is removed and the coffee is fermented for 24-36 hour under close shade depending on climate temperatures . After fermentation the coffees are washed and again graded by density in washing channels they randomly do soaking in clean water over night in clean water. They are then taken to the drying tables where they will be sun dried 12 to 20 days on African drying beds. Again this time depends on weather conditions. Coffees are covered in plastic during midday and at night to protect the beans from night moisture and rains.

 ”Working together with the exporters Daniella and Pedro we are supporting their program Sol de Mañana which is educating the farmers in treatments for leaf-rust and how a higher price can be achieve for higher quality. Villa Tunari is a colony in Caranarvi that have just started working in the project.” /Joanna Alm, Head roaster, Drop Coffee
 Elda is a young women who together with her husband Felix Choquehuanca source beautiful cherries from the colony of Taypiplaya. During the day they both tend the land, pruning, clearing and picking the cherries.  
 At the end of the day both Elda and Felix hand sort the cherries for unripes and defects, knowing this will help them be selected as a micro lot. Then by Taxi they deliver their cherries to the Buena Vista mill Every night from 12 pm to 4 am where the coffee is processed.  If selected as a micro lot it is separated and then cupped at the mill to access its quality. Being selected means a higher price for the cherry, and can then go on to be a lot like this one. 
 They are now a part of the program that Daniela and Pedro has, called Sol de Manana. Pedro and Daniela are exporting the coffee and finding a good market for it, they are also training the farmers to work for a higher quality with less leaf-rust.
 Producer: Elda and Felix ChoquehuancaLocation: Taypiplaya, Caranavi, Bolivia Varietal: Caturra, Catuaí and Typica Harvest: May to September 2015, peaking in June and JulyProcess Date: 19th July 2015Elevation:  1550-1650 maslProcessing: Full-washed Flavour description: A mature and sweet cup with a medium body. Notes of red grape, raisin and dried fruit.  
 Forty years ago, a cup of coffee was nothing more than a caffeine delivery vehicle. It didn't really matter how it tasted, it just had to slap you awake in the morning or prop you up through a long afternoon. But in the last decade or so, things have changed. A lot. A few people scattered across the country discovered how amazing a cup of coffee can be when you source the beans directly from farmers you know. When you roast the beans yourself in such a way that nothing intrinsic to the coffee is removed. When you brew the coffee with down-to-the-second precision.
 Ritual has been a pioneer in this delicious shift in coffee consciousness since we opened our doors on Valencia Street in 2005 and started what some call a coffee revolution in San Francisco. Our goal then--and our goal now--is to craft the very best cup of coffee available anywhere. Period. We've learned a lot over the years, but the care and attention we lavish on our process is unchanged, including tasting every coffee several times before it goes out to our coffee bars and into your cup.
 We don't do all of this to make coffee more complicated. We do it because pretty much everybody who works here has had a moment where a really, really good cup of coffee changed their lives.
 A blend of chocolate tones and sweet fruits
 Orion was designed to produce a unique espresso blend accentuating the elegance of chocolate and the complex nature of sweet fruit. 
 When we started planning our coffee program, we knew we wanted a strong, foundational house espresso; something complex enough to be enjoyed alone, and additionally have enough depth to hold up in milk. The combination of elements had to reflect something greater than their parts. Each character had to play its role to balance and accentuate the others. In unison, they create Orion: rich and silky in body, covering a range of chocolate tones with balancing notes of dark berries and citrus highlights. Although the elements occasionally change to reflect the seasonality of coffee harvests, these are the driving principles behind how we shape Orion.
 Orion, our flagship espresso, bears a name loaded in history. Orion is a constellation on the celestial equator. It is so bright and recognizable in the sky that humans have been marveling at it since the beginning of time. The belt of Orion is aligned with major, unexplained monoliths, such as the Great Pyramids and Teotihuacan. In Mayan culture, Orion was believed to be the beginning point of all creation, and they built their metropolis in response to it. In Greek myths, Orion is a superhuman giant often represented with a bronze club and shield. Even some US history has references to Orion: The Hopi villages (in what is now Arizona) from 1120AD mimic major stars of Orion like a map. Hopi beloved Orion was origin of their creator, Massaw. Ubiquitous in myth, Orion is the foundation for cities and culture.

 Throughout the years of civil war and unrest in Nicaragua, Don Anibal kept growing low‐risk vegetables like bell pepper, onions, and cabbage on his valley farm. He was moderately successful,but his dreams were up in the clouds. When peace finally came to the Nubarrones, that’s exactly where he went: the highlands of Nubarrones (“thunderclouds”).
 Up in the Nubarrones, he bought a modest 37 acres‐‐that’s about two Dolores Parks, for you locals. Unlike Dolores Park, this farm lacked roads. There are probably a lot of other things at Dolores Park that Anibal’s new farm lacked, but a way to and from the moutainside farm… well, that was a bit of a hurdle.
 Don Anibal spent more of his vegetable farm profits on a few mules to ferry supplies up and down until he finished the road. He expanded the farm in all directions. All the while, Anibal’s long‐held dream continued to glow in the back of his mind: the chance to start a coffee farm, up among the clouds.
 This is the Maragogype separation from Anibal’s farm‐‐his Caturra is among our usual offerings. The first time we visited Anibal’s farm, we hiked straight uphill, from the base of his farm to the Honduras‐bordering peak. Up at the top, a south‐facing expanse of beautiful Maragogype came into view, like a mirage. Since that day, Anibal started sending us separated samples of this lot, and now here we are, with an outstanding SMALL lot.

	We've been proudly featuring Fair Trade/Organic coffees since 1999 and throughout that time we've developed longstanding relationships with a number of co-ops that provide us with exemplary coffee year after year.
			
 Cupping notes : Sweet-smoky, Tamarind, Layered
Roast level : DARK
 Our Organic Colombia Tolima comes from the municipality of Planadas in the southern tip of the Tolima Province. Lying in the foothills of the Central Andes, Tolima is known for its mineral-rich soils and fresh water. Though relatively unknown in the coffee industry until recently, Tolima is now the country’s third largest coffee producer and is increasingly being recognized for producing great tasting coffee.
 The beans in this lot come from two small cooperatives in Planadas: ASOPAP and Resguardo Indígena Nasa We’sx.
 The 29 members of the ASOPAP cooperative are fully committed to quality coffee and organic standards from their farms, which are situated at 5,400-6,200 feet. Their beans have yielded excellent cup profiles for some time, drawing attention from international coffee traders.
 The Nasa We’sx are an indigenous community brought to Planadas in the early 1900s by the Colombian Army as a mine workforce. For decades, they were caught in the conflict between the army and the largest guerilla group in the country, FARC, until recently, when they made a peace pact with local guerrillas.
 Cupping notes : Smooth smoke,  Caramelized sugar, Silky body
Roast level : DARK
 This is our darkest Fair Trade/Organic certified blend. We thoughtfully selected the coffees that make up this blend in order to maintain some of their individual aroma and flavor attributes while standing up to the intensity of the unique way that we roast them. The result is a dark roasted coffee with smoky flavor, peppery body and just a hint of caramelized sugars ; a perfect way to ease into your morning and a great complement to an evening meal.
 Cupping notes : Sweet Chocolate, Sweet Caramel, Fruit toned acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Originally created as the companion to our Golden Gate House Blend, this espresso has a sweet chocolate flavor complimented by notes of fruit and caramel along with a well balanced acidity. It is a harmonious blend of Fair Trade and Organic certified coffees.
 Cupping notes : Chocolate, Sweet Caramel, Fruit toned acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Whether approaching by sea or from within the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Strait imbues a sense of magic and wonder. The stunning landscapes and picture perfect sunsets inspired us here at Mr. Espresso to create a blend that attempts to capture its grace and majesty. Dark chocolate, sweet caramel and fruit toned acidity seamlessly blend together to create our homage to this wonder of nature.
 Cupping notes : Strawberry jam, Milk chocolate, Currant
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Guaya’b is a cooperative of over 300 indigenous Mayan and Quichua farming families in the region of Jacaltenango, Huehuetenango. Since the introduction of coffee into the Jacaltenango region 40 years ago natural habitats, flora and fauna have slowly made a comeback from the once de-forested land. The recreation of the natural habitat has allowed for the reduction of soil erosion, restored natural habits and given the coffee crops a lush canopy that allows them to ripen slowly. Rich & delicately fruity; you’ll experience a thought provoking brew that begins with a chewy, chocolaty body that develops into a strawberry jaminess infused with deeper, bright fruit tones that suggest currant and raspberry.
 Cupping notes : Red danjou pear, Raspberry honey, Malt-like body
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Situated deep in the interior folds of the Southern Sierra Madre Mountains in Chiapas, Mexico is the coffee growing cooperative of Ramal Santa Cruz. Among this multitude of coffee farms lies the home of Augustin Sanchez Espinoza and his three brothers who all farm together on adjacent parcels of land. The farms of the Brothers Sanchez are at the upper reaches of viable coffee cultivation, starting at 1600 meters and topping at just over 1800 meters, the highest of all coffee grown in the cooperative. The family began planting coffee on the land in the early 1970s. Many of the original plants are still producing. The majority of the coffee is Typica and Bourbon with a scattering of more recently planted Caturra.
 The coffee from these four brothers and their farms make up our Mexico Fair Trade, Organic, Ramal Santa Cruz , Cuatro Hermanos.  This coffee greets you with a  red danjou pear citrus acidity followed with hints of raspberry honey and Meyer lemon.  We hope you will enjoy this extraordinarily smooth coffee from the Cuatro Hermanos.
 Cupping notes : Rich chocolate, Hazelnut, Mellow acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Our goal with Organic Neapolitan was to create an espresso blend that contained similar attributes as our conventional Neapolitan using only coffees that are Fair Trade certified and grown without the use of agrichemicals. Complex, intense and rich in both flavor and aroma, Organic Neapolitan Espresso is the perfect balance of taste and social responsibility.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 A blend of Fair Trade and organic certified coffees. Seven Bridges Blend is a velvety bodied blend with depth and a complex, multilayer flavor dynamic. A favorite among customers and chefs alike, this blend can be found at some of the finest dining establishments around the San Francisco Bay Area.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Modeled after our Organic Seven Bridges Blend, this blend has all the positive characteristics of the Organic Seven Bridges Blend without the caffeine. A good alternative for after dinner enjoyment or simply for those who are caffeine sensitive. The blend is 99.9% caffeine free.
 Cupping notes : Cocoa-caramel, Fruit-tones, bold body
Roast level : MEDIUM
 The challenge in creating a blend that reflects the ideal characteristics of a truly delicious espresso is too often compounded by the availability and quality of the decaffeinated coffees on the market. Organic Decaffeinated Espresso is a challenge met. Thick, golden cremaand cocoa-caramel aromatics that follow through into the cup with distinct, yet subtle fruit notes. Perfectly balanced in milk drinks and alive with flavor as a straight shot.

 Why do we only sell one kind of filter basket in our webshop?  Simple.
 The key to uniform extractions and consistency between group-heads is the goal of every coffee professional.  We have developed a tamper that is so precise that it can only work with a VST Ridgeless Basket.  The tolerance for our tamper is 0.02mm, which has been unheard until we pushed the limits with our tamper bases and with any other baskets, it simply will jam or not fit.  These baskets are so uniform that along with our tamper you will increase your extractions without fail, while setting a bar for your barista team to work in a uniform way.
 This is not for everyone, but if you want the most precise combination of a competition grade tamper and basket, this is it, hands down.

 By luck and chance we were offered this stellar micro lot from the Consaca Cooperative in Narino Colombia. Colombia is an country we know very well and have built some of our strongest producer Direct Trade partnerships with. This however is our first ever from the area of Narino in the far southwest of Colombia. We have visited Narino once before while on the Jury of for the Cup of Excellence held in Pasto, Narino. While there we met the producer group of Consaca. Randomly 4 years later we receive a sample from a close Exporter partner in Colombia from Consaca, and surprise it delicious. The rest they say is history...Or maybe the future...

 Clean, juicy sweetness with mild acidity, pleasantly balanced with medium body.
 This blend is like one of the mixtapes you made for the person you really like-liked, but didn't know very well. It is balanced, a little bass-y and a little bright. The components meld together well, and most people will like it. We leave this blend open to change depending on the season, our offerings and what tastes yummy. It's a crowd pleaser, or it's for that special someone that you don't want to scare away with either Norwegian black metal or Jewel.

 Why You’ll Love It: With notes of almond and orange zest, this brew shows how climate, soil, and community can subtly change the familiar Central American coffee profile. Story of The Bean: La Llamada is a small micro lot on the La Bastilla farm, a Rainforest Alliance-certified producer for over 10 years. La Bastilla is extremely involved in the local community, and operates a primary school for 165 students, in addition to a technical agricultural school that teaches ecologically sound cultivation practices to over 50 students producing honey, dairy, vegetables, and coffee. This fully washed, Caturra-variety coffee takes on some of the bright citrus notes typical of higher altitude beans, but stays true to the sweet, full flavors of traditional Central American coffees. Nutty, syrupy almond notes balance out fruit flavors of red grape and orange, making this a coffee you'll crave every morning.

 This delicious coffee comes to us through a strong relationship between Joe and the El Paraiso growers association in Huila. From the beginning of our roasting adventure, El Paraiso has connected Joe with a number of excellent, high-quality Colombian coffees. In fact, Joe currently purchases 40% of El Paraiso’s annual output. This particular selection was grown by a special group of El Paraiso’s member farmers: The Guarnizo Family. 
 The Guarnizo family is comprised of 9 brothers and 1 sister who own and operate 6 total farms in the area surrounding the town of Tarqui. Their 6 farms sit between 1600 and 1800 meters in elevation on the eastern slopes of the Central Cordillera in the Andes Mountains. They primarily grow Caturra and Colombia varieties with plantings of Yellow Caturra and Geisha planned for the next few years. Processing and drying here is very simple but carefully monitored. The cherries are placed in a tank filled with water where the floating cherries are separated from the higher quality, denser cherries that sink to the bottom. After passing through a basic depulping machine with a small amount of water, the seeds are then fermented for 24 hours in tile-lined tanks. After fermentation, the coffee is washed in the same tank with fresh water before being placed on raised beds to dry. 
 The Guarnizos dry their coffee in shade for about a week before moving it to a sunnier, covered solar dryer where it will dry slowly for another 10-15 days. They carefully monitor the temperature and humidity in the dryer and regulate them by opening or closing ventilation flaps in the structure. The beds remained covered because of the unpredictable rains in this region of Colombia. When the coffee is dried to the proper level, they will deliver their parchment coffee to the El Paraiso warehouse for quality assessment and payment. 
 Our initial conversations with El Paraiso involved having a fixed-price contract with one or two of the Guarnizo family farms but the Guarnizos banded together to include all 6 farms. They and Joe agreed on a quality minimum, based on El Paraiso’s cupping scores and a quantity over the course of a year. The fixed contract allows the entire family to count on a steady price for their higher quality coffees while easing some of the worry of market volatility with what would be differentially- priced coffees based on a fluctuating commodities market. It’s a true win-win agreement. 
 This part of Colombia has 2 harvests per year. The first semester runs from April-July while the second usually runs from October-December. The two growing periods allows us to have fresh coffee from these farms all year round.
 All orders are roasted on Monday and Thursday and are shipped on the same day. Note that if you order Two-Day Shipping after 7am on any given day, your order will be processed *the following roast day*. We do this to ensure your coffee arrives to you as fresh as possible!
 All coffee is delivered whole bean. If you need your order ground, please specify your brew method in the special instructions section.
 For questions concerning your order, please email orders@joenewyork.com.

 These are current, fresh crop filter coffees. This means in the summer to early winter, you’ll see lots from Central America and East Africa. In the winter through the spring, southern hemisphere will take over.
 This is a new delivery of San Juan, fresh crop and full of the first part of the harvest. These pickings are beautifully sweet and fruit forward.
 Under Luis Pedro’s supervision, the coffee is shaded entirely at the beginning of its life at the farm. This year completes the 3 year cycle of pruning and maintenance through most of the farm. The idea was to renovate in thirds - pruning every third row, allowing the row immediately behind it to receive more sun and hence have more production, mitigating declines in overall yield. This is typical practice for San Juan, and the farm is looking exceptional. The focus on agronomical practices is quite outstanding, from soil renewal, irrigation control to pruning and picking - this is a year round project that brings us some of our favorite coffees from Guatemala.

 Economic and ergonomic, the Skerton has an anti-slip grip that lends a hand when it’s time to grind.
 The larger storage capacity is nice if you want to brew more than one cup. A fair warning: Hand grinders do take a little elbow grease, but burr is better!

 
              When people ask us about better brewing tips, getting the grind right is always at the top of our suggestion list. Read more.

 We devote constant attention to Big Truck and think it might be the best organic espresso blend you can find. Coffee is a seasonal fresh produce and different producing countries have varied seasons and harvest periods. We strive to buy smaller lots in their prime to keep the blend as fresh as possible. The ingredients of the blend change based upon seasonality, yet the flavor profile for Big Truck remains the same.

 With notes of tropical fruit and blackcurrant, this coffee exhibits many of the hallmark characteristics of a Santa Barbara Honduran.
 An aptitude for growing coffee runs in the Benitez family. With a family involved in coffee for generations; Juan and his brother own neighboring small-farms in the Cielito region of the Santa Barbara mountainside where their Pacas trees thrive. 
 Benitez employs traditional processing methods compared to rural Honduran standards. Upon de-pulping his coffee into a tile-lined tub, it undergoes a dry fermentation for 24 hours until the mucilage begins separating from the parchment. Coffee is then washed and dried on raised beds in a greenhouse before being delivered to Beneficio San Vicente for trial and dry-milling..

 Bourbon coffee cherries thrive at over 2,000 meters above sea level in the mountains on Lake Kivu, where several hundred farmers deliver their coffee cherry to the Cotecaga washing station. At the station, the seeds are de-pulped from the coffee fruit using disc depulpers. They are then dry-fermented in tanks—imparting complex flavors—before being washed in long channels, soaked overnight, and then dried on raised beds. Organic production is common in Rwanda, though very few seek certification. We travel there annually to work directly with the station’s owner, C. Dormans, to cup lots of coffee separated throughout the harvest. This is the world exclusive lot to Olympia Coffee Lot 1 from the first week of the harvest.

 Fresh Blueberries · Dark Chocolate · Balanced  
 This variant is currently sold out
 Please fill in the form below if you'd like to be notified when it becomes available.
 The Sermon is our fruit forward and heavy bodied espresso. A fresh, lighty tart blueberry and coffee cherry up front, with dark chocolate in the finish. These flavor characteristics blend incredibly well in milk drinks making a cappuccino with The Sermon decadent and dessert-like.
 The Sermon has always been a new take on an old classic. A round body, heavy chocolate notes and berry sweetness are what we consistently strive for. We find coffees that suit this profile and create a blend that focuses on flavor, and highlights coffees from East Africa and South America. Fazenda Aurea a dry-processed Catuai from Brazil, offers a sturdy body and is a great background, while a perfect Guji dry-processed Ethiopia provides an intense berry note. Balancing out these extremes is a coffee from Colombia made up of smallholder farmers' coffees from the northern Cauca region; known for being clean, sweet and full of ripe fruit flavors. All together they yield an espresso that is both exciting and approachable.
 The Sermon excels on a wide variety of espresso machine types (including the old-school, vintage lever machine types). We use a relatively standard approach on our more modern equipment. The Sermon is versatile, so a shorter shot tastes great too. Some folks also like to use the blend on their coffee brewer or press pot for a deep cup.

 Amazingly complex and vibrant peaberry lot from the Gakuyu farmers cooperative in the Mathira East district of Kenya. It is composed of SL 28/34 cultivars grown at 1800 meters, washed and dried on raised beds. You'll immediately take note of its physical appearance: small, dense, rolled-up looking little peaberries. While that alone doesn't indicate quality potential, we certainly love the evenness and density of the small beans and how explosive this lot is! We are absolutely enamored with its clean, supple, winey profile. It's full package coffee, with notes ranging from raspberry to dark chocolate, mango, and honey. 
 12 oz / 340 g whole bean
 We roast and ship on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. Orders placed Thurs through Sunday will roast and ship Monday.

 When Coava Coffee Roasters began packaging coffee by the kilogram in 2008 our intention was twofold: First: Our roaster has been designed to operate most efficiently by the kilogram. By sticking to the metric system and maintaining strict roast cycles, we’ve been able to reduce our waste to less than one pound of coffee per week. This careful planning is another way we show respect for the work of the coffee producers we represent. Second: Roasting by the kilogram allows us to package our coffees in 250 gram increments. Known as the Coava 250, our retail bags promote freshness, dissuade waste, and divide evenly with most brew methods. It is the perfect quantity for the average coffee drinker.
 To show respect for the full chain of quality coffee (sourcing, roasting, preparing) we do not offer any blends. Our coffees carry the names of the co-ops and individual farmers who harvest, process, and prepare them for us. We commit to show honor where honor is due.
 We only partner with producers who are mindful of their people, their environment, and their crop. The farms we work with take great care of their coffee from seedling to harvest, through processing and storing, and finally in packaging. It is through these sustainable partnerships that we ensure the longevity of the coffee beans and the final quality in the cup.
 We only work with the best importers and exporters. Their transparency, care for the farmers, and quality of transportation and storage of our coffees is absolutely essential. These partners are rarely heralded, but hold our industry together. Once the coffees arrive in Portland we move them directly into our green room. This temperature controlled room combines several proprietary practices and ensures that all of the work done before us is kept intact.

  Finca Tamana by Tim Wendelboe 349,-
 Immy Camarade is one of Rwanda’s many female entrepreneurs. In fact, she owns the gas station in Kigali where we picked her up for the drive out to her brand new Karisimbi mill. That mill, even in its young state, is part of the incredible transformation the Rwandan coffee industry has experienced over the last 20 years.
 That transition–from focusing exclusively on volume to adding the element of quality–happened at the processing level. The yummy Bourbon variety coffee, the volcanic soil, and the climate have always been there; infrastructure and habit were the only things to improve. Karisimbi mill is among those mills working exclusively with fully washed coffees, and accentuating excellence rather than sheer quantity.
 Of course, the country itself has gone through bigger changes than that. Rwandans really capitalized upon the assistance international NGOs have offered since Rwanda’s 1994 genocide. The country seemed to us to be one of the most clean, safe, and progressive places we’d ever been. On an individual level, Immy herself joined a businesswoman’s delegation that visited the US for entrepreneurial training, including a stint working with coffee folks like us.
 Immy’s nascent mill in Karisimbi is still a small and temporary setup. This year’s output–her first ever–was only around 1,300 pounds total. But she has pretty big plans, and we hope to partner with her for years to come.
 Designed to go with the 6 cup or 8 cup Chemex coffee maker. These are pre-folded filters, famous for their thickness which allows as clean of a cup as possible with a manual pour over brewer. We love these.

 This coffee comes to us through one of our most celebrated producer relationships, a longstanding connection with the Mierisch family in Nicaragua. We visit the family each year to taste and select coffees as well as observe improvements and expansions on their farms. 
 Mama Mina—the nickname that Steve, Eleane, and Erwin Mierisch gave to their grandmother Giurmina—sits on land that has been in the family for more than 100 years. Erwin “Doc” Mierisch acquired the land in 1994 after the civil war, and began quickly working to improve the conditions by re-planting higher quality cultivars and implementing quality systems for pruning, harvesting, and processing. 
 These Caturra and Catuai cultivars are grown between 1,275 and 1,400 meters above sea level, and harvested between December and March each year. After the ripe cherries are harvested, they are processed at the Mama Mina wet mill, where they are depulped and fermented in concrete tanks overnight. The coffee is washed in channels before being transported to the patios and dry mill in at Beneficio Don Esteban outside of Matagalpa where it is dried, sorted, and milled for export. 
 This lot of coffee, which was constructed out of coffees from a few different harvest dates and a few different parts of the farm, struck us as being balanced and approachable while carrying a signature brightness and sweetness.
 All orders are roasted on Monday and Thursday and are shipped on the same day. Note that if you order Two-Day Shipping after 7am on any given day, your order will be processed *the following roast day*. We do this to ensure your coffee arrives to you as fresh as possible!

 This cold brew takes its name from the famous Zamboni ice resurfacer. The Zamboni Company has a history of innovation in keeping cold things smooth. The family started in refrigeration over 90 years ago and as the popularity of ice skating rose, Frank Zamboni shared his ice-related talent by building the Iceland skating rink in southern California in 1939; later, he introduced the world's first ice resurfacing machine. Through Frank's persistence and commitment to the industry, Zamboni has become famous all over the world.  We hope that this cold brew can achieve some of the same goals. We want you to enjoy something that tastes smooth and delicious, and cools you down fast. This blend is specifically sourced and roasted for the cold brew method. The base is a natural processed Brazil—giving it a chocolate-toffee base, while the Ethiopian component gives it a higher noted, wild, fruity element.
 To brew this coffee the way we think you should ;) you'll need to use one whole bag (12oz) to 7 cups of water. Use a coarse grind (like for a french press) and steep in cold water in the fridge for 12-14 hours. Drain the brew and cut with 50% cold filtered water. 
 Add on one of our cold brew retail bottles to store (some of) your brewed cold brew! We can't send you our brewed concentrate, but you could use this bottle and pretend like we did. Bottle also works great for using as a vase for a few flowers, storing homemade ginger beer or kombucha, or shampoo.

 In 6th century Ethiopia, a goatherder named Kaldi stumbled upon his wandering flock as they sampled berries from nearby bushes. Ordinarily sluggish, his goats had an unusual amount of energy. After tasting several seeds himself, Kaldi discovered that the berries were the cause for the increased energy. It wasn’t long before coffee beans and their stimulating effect traveled far and wide.

 Why you'll love it: Our freshest green coffees are expertly blended and carefully roasted to create a brew that's sweet and seasonal.
 Story of the bean: When you cook a dinner of locally grown, seasonal vegetables, you know that the great taste is thanks to not only the chef, but to the farmer who grew the food with care and diligence. It’s the same with coffee. Quality starts at origin and, for us, the Origins blend is about giving credit where credit is due: with the farmer.  Farmers work hard to develop unique and distinct flavors in their high-quality coffee varieties. We designed this blend to bring those origin flavors forward, adapting our roasting style to downplay the smoky flavors the roaster creates. As a result, fruity, natural flavors like lemonade and blackberry really shine through. By changing the blend seasonally to highlight the freshest and sweetest-tasting coffees available, we’re getting back to our Origins.
 Blend notes: Lemonade, Blackberry, Black Tea

 Our green buying team constructed this regional lot while cupping dozens of freshly harvested coffees in Antigua at Bella Vista Mill in January. In our search, small producer lots from Chimaltenango stood out as the most fruited, vibrant and sweet coffees available. To present the best possible offering, we decided upon constructing this blend from our three top-scoring lots. Chimaltenango is a central region in Guatemala and possesses many of the ideal characteristics to produce exceptional coffees: 1800 to 2000 meters of altitude paired with a vast majority of Caturra and Bourbon varieties make for a solid foundation of quality. This cup leads with aromatics and flavors of toffee and nougat and continues to become more vibrant as it cools with a dynamic display of flavors ranging from black cherry to milk chocolate to cashew butter.
 Fresh coffee is roasted every Sunday, Monday and Wednesday and shipped the following day. Please place your order by 5:00 PM Eastern Time the evening before the respective roast day to ensure that it is included.

 There’s more than one way to make a coffee. Like, totally hypothetically, let’s just say you decided to start growing coffee on a little stretch of steep‐sloped land through which the Karru Nagesso river runs. That would be totally normal. But what if the river was at the peak, not valley, of your land?
 Well, growing coffee below a river would allow you to use that river for cheap and clean irrigation without pumps and generators. In fact, you could even dig a couple trenches to flood your farm once a month in the dry season. Of course, if you did all that, you’d be doing something nobody else does; would that be cool with you?
 It’s cool with Tolemariam (“Tolu”) Jibat, who founded Goljo just a decade ago. His parents were coffee farmers, but he chose to head to town and start a few pharmacies. He seems to have picked up a lot of ideas from fruit farmers, or maybe just his own ingenious brain.
 Ethiopia, on the other hand, features the most traditional techniques of any producer. (That stands to reason, considering Ethiopia started growing coffee a few hundred years before the rest of us caught on.) Our very first batch of Goljo combines both traditions: something old, something new, something borrowed, and something to brew.

 Spyhouse West, our fourth location, opened its doors in August 2015. The design and artistic aesthetic of the North Loop community reflects our vision for coffee culture, and therefore inspired a cafe that reflects that commitment to creative integrity.
 We are so humbled by the warm response from the neighborhood, and happy to call it another home away from home.

 Why You'll Love It: Unique, high-altitude growing conditions and slow-drying during processing infuse this coffee with bright, balanced fruit flavors.Story of The Bean: The mountains of Huehuetenango (way-way-te-nan-go) in the Western Highlands of Guatemala are known for exceptionally high-quality coffee.  Dry, hot winds blowing from southern Mexico protect the coffee plants from frost at night, allowing the beans to mature more slowly and soak up more of the cherry fruit. This is what gives the coffee its sweet flavor.   After the beans have been removed from their fruit, they are laid out to dry. Deviating from common practices, producers in Huehuetenango stack the beans so that they'll dry slower. Because some of coffee fruit remains on the bean while they dry, they take on unmistakable raisin and melon notes. A smooth, fruity coffee to brighten up mornings.

 In Kenya, wet mills are called “factories,” and are run by cooperative societies comprised of smallholder farmers. The Thangathi coffee factory is part of the New Gikaru Cooperative Society, along with 3 other factories in Nyeri County. Thangathi takes delivery of coffee cherries from around 1350 farmer members from the surrounding area. These farms grow mostly SL28 and SL34 cultivars with a small amount of Ruiru11 and Batian, at elevations between 1400 and 1600 meters above sea level.Farmers take ripe cherries to be processed at the factory where they are pulped, fermented overnight, washed and sun-dried on elevated tables. Dry parchment is then taken to a dry mill for further processing and grading. During their harvest from November to February, Thangathi produces on average 105,000 kgs of clean coffee every year. We are excited to showcase this coffee and celebrate our relationship with our partners at Collaborative Coffee Source.
 All orders are roasted on Monday and Thursday and are shipped on the same day. Note that if you order Two-Day Shipping after 7am on any given day, your order will be processed *the following roast day*. We do this to ensure your coffee arrives to you as fresh as possible!
 All coffee is delivered whole bean. If you need your order ground, please specify your brew method in the special instructions section.

 When designing our seasonal blend Telemetry, we look at our entire lineup of single origin coffees from that season, and think about the flavors each varietal is bringing to the table, and how they may work together to create a blend that is sweet, bright, and rounded in its flavors and character. 
 We've designed the component series to allow you to explore the construction of Telemetry. Each pack includes a 4oz bag of each Telemetry component, as well as a 4oz bag of Telemetry itself. Taste them separately, or together, and build your own understanding of how we structure our blends, and how unique flavors can work together to create something really special.

  We have been part of developing the Oslo cup series from Figgjo together with designer Kristin Hærnes Ihlen from Physical Design and Figgjo. Therte are three different cups in the series. All made to enhance the drinking experience.
  We have been part of developing the Oslo cup series from Figgjo together with designer Kristin Hærnes Ihlen from Physical Design and Figgjo. Therte are three different cups in the series. All made to enhance the drinking experience:
 "Tulipan" (Tulip) is designed for coffees with lower acidity like typical Bourbons from El Salvador, Brazil or Indian coffees. The cone shaped cup enhances more earthy aromas and gives you an impression that the coffee is very sweet as the liquid enters the mouth in a narrow stream and hits the middle of the tongue.
 "Splitt" is designed for coffees with intense fruity and floral aromas and bright acidity. Typically we use these cups for our Kenyan and Ethiopian coffees. The unique design enhances the aromatics when you smell the coffee in the cup and the wide shape makes the liquid enter your mouth with a wider spread so that you percieve acidity more clearly.
  "Åpen" (open) is more of an allround cup. The classic U-shape is a forgiving shape when it comes to taste balance yet it has the ability to intensify aromas when you smell the coffees. We typically use these cups for coffees that has fruity characters and medium intense acidity. 
 The fun part is that you can play around with the different shapes with different coffees and change your guests perception of how the coffees taste like.
 All the rich enjoyment of a cup of feel-good coffee, without the caffeine. Our Decaf Organic Blend is a peaceful, fulfilling way to wake up. You'll enjoy the dark chocolate and almond flavors - as well as the fact that it's made entirely with USDA-certified organic coffees.

 Currently only roasting for espresso.  Check back soon for filter roasts.
 Mr. Nicolas Castillo is so passionate about coffee that even at 63 years of age, he works out in the coffee plantation. Currently he has 60 hectares planted with coffee, to which he has dedicated much care and has constantly renovated to have the plantation in optimal conditions and younger plants to produce quality and higher yields. For Nicola’s plantation the best shade tree has been the Chalum and Capulil, which has planted around the coffee for the share of course but also for the organic material that they provide back to his soils. He is trying to grow his coffee as organic as possible.

 Syrupy and intensely sweet, like a raisin, Lucila Bolaños' coffee pairs red fruit with a clementine acidity.
 When they arrived to the farm twelve years ago, they found not coffee trees but rather cattle pastures. Along with her husband, Marco Antonio, Lucila Bolaños began recovering the two opposing hillsides that make up Finca El Porvenir with castillo trees. 
 As we walked the farm with Lucila and her family, her son-in-law, Jose, casually harvested banana, plantain, yucca and avocado from the trees that also call home to "El Porvenir" providing shade and windbreak to the coffee trees, as well as food to the Bolaños family. 
 Lucila Bolaños castillo produce is processed in the typical Colombian small-farmer fashion where it's depulped and soaked in small, plastic fermentation tubs before drying in her on-site parabolic drier.

 *We are pleased to offer free ground shipping for orders $65 and up within Canada and the continental USA. To see if this option will work for you, simply scroll down for a handy map that includes transit ETA.* 
 Q: When will my order ship?
  A: We ship all online orders Monday - Friday. On Canadian holidays, your order will ship the next available shipping day. If you would like your order to ship the same day, that can be done! Simply have your order submitted before 10am PST on weekdays.
 Q: What kind of shipping should I choose for my order?
 A: There are a couple options available to get your order to you when you need it. We offer all services that are available with Canada Post. If choosing a UPS option, we have UPS Standard, Expedited or UPS Express Saver. 
 Q: I placed an order, but haven’t received my package yet, and I ordered it awhile ago; where is it?
 A: We want you to get your order quickly and error free. Since we work with Canada Post and/or UPS to make this happen, we will need your help too! If it’s taking longer than usual, first take a look at your tracking number that gets emailed to you upon shipping. If the tracking indicates that the package has been delivered, give Canada Post or UPS a call; they are the most appropriate people to help in this case. It is possible there was an error in the shipping address. In some cases, severe weather warnings can delay things as well.
 We do nitrogen flush both our coffees and teas, so even though we hope a delay doesn’t happen, it is much less likely to affect the quality and freshness of your order.
 Q: Do you offer free shipping?
 A: We currently offer free ground shipping on orders of $65 or more within Canada and the continental USA for online orders. For wholesale accounts - we offer free ground shipping for orders above 40lbs in both continental USA and Canada. For more information on becoming a wholesale partner, check out our wholesale page.
 Q: Do you ship to the U.S.A.?
 A: Yes we do! We've got some pretty good shipping rates as well. Just a reminder that duties and fees are not charged on coffee orders - however, for purchases on retail items exceeding $200.00, you become responsible for any duties and fees.
 Q: How about to the rest of the world?
 A. We can ship coffee just about anywhere, but it can get pricey depending on where you are located. Brokerage, duties and taxes associated with international shipping apply solely to the customer and we assume no responsibility for issues with international shipping. If you have any questions, you can contact us at onlines@49thcoffee.com.
 Q: What is your return policy?
 A: We can help with returns on a case by case basis. For opened coffee and tea, these are not refundable. Please contact onlines@49thcoffee and one of us will get back to you as soon as we can.

 Because it was conceived just 38.5 miles from our Oakland roastery by Aerobie (those wonderful folks who created an improbably long-flying disc), we'd like to humbly assert that the AeroPress is our first locally-produced piece of merchandise. It’s a peculiar and lovely device – easily the most durable and portable option for brewing quality coffee. It produces a cup that’s thick and focused, but still quite nuanced.

 Bring to a boil enough water for both the AeroPress and your brew vessel. 400 grams ought to do it.
 Insert a paper filter into the AeroPress’s detachable plastic cap.
 Weigh out 15 grams of coffee.
 Grind your coffee. AeroPress calls for a fine grind – just a bit more so than drip coffee.
 Assemble your AeroPress. Make sure the entire assembly is dry, since any residual moisture can compromise the device’s seal.
 Place it on your scale with the flared end up, then tare the weight. The numbers should appear upside-down. It’s possible to attach the black filter cap and place it right side-up, but this tends to cause leakage and make accurate brewing slightly more difficult.
 Add your ground coffee. Be careful not to spill any grounds into the ring-shaped gutter at the top of the AeroPress, as this can make attaching the cap a challenge later on.
 Add twice the weight of water to your amount of grounds. For example, if you’ve got 15 grams of coffee, add 30 grams of water. Your water ought to be about 200 F.
 Gently immerse the grounds with a bamboo paddle or butter knife. The goal here is not to stir them so much as it is to guarantee even saturation. Let this sit for 30 seconds.
 Add another 160 grams of water and let sit for one minute.
 Use the remainder of your water (it should be about 200 grams) to wet your filter and cap. The water will serve a dual function here: It will both help the filter adhere to the cap, and it will heat your brewing vessel.
 After a minute has elapsed, give your grounds 10 vigorous stirs.
 Screw the cap onto the AeroPress. You’re in very close proximity to seriously hot coffee here, so please be careful.
 Flip the whole assembly over with haste and control and purpose. All three. Position it atop your brew vessel and begin applying downward pressure. You ought to experience about 30 pounds of resistance here. If the pushing feels too easy, your grind is likely too coarse; if it’s very hard to push, chances are the grind is a bit too fine. Your coffee’s fully brewed once it begins to make a hissing sound. This means there’s no more water to push through the device.
 Now here’s the really satisfying part, for two reasons. Once you’ve unscrewed the cap, you can pop out the filter and the puck of condensed grounds by simply pushing the AeroPress’s interior section a final inch. Then, of course, you can pour your coffee and enjoy. And please do enjoy.
 This lot actually combines three farms, all owned by members of the Lovo family. Each farm’s lot was washed in a separate beneficio, then immediately delivered to the La Estrella mill for drying on African‐style raised and shaded beds.
 First, there’s dad: Don Joaquin Augusto Lovo Lopez. He’s sort of the neighborhood’s go‐to elder for specialty coffee. He made sure that his sons were educated, but kept them working on the family farm evenings and weekends.
 Among the sons: David Ariel Lovo Gutierrez. David Ariel bought Finca La Pradera back in 1969, and‐‐except for the conflicts of the 1980s‐‐hasn’t left it since.
 Finally, his brother: Don Luis Joaquin Lovo. He’s basically the spokesman for the family, or at least the guy who sells us the coffee. Don Luis is actually a pretty quiet guy for a spokesman, come to think of it. What he is, is driven. He’s the one who pesters the Estrella mill‐workers and his export partners, frequently checking in on the coffee’s quality, always seeking feedback.
 It was a desire for feedback as much as anything that motivated Don Luis to hold back a few bags of his Maragogype crop for the Nicaraguan Cup of Excellence. What he got was an award. We’ll have a little of that for you this summer. But for now, step into this Caturra lot from the whole Lovo family.

 This week we have released three coffees from Bolivia. This is a big milestone for Drop Coffee, to be able to manage and work directly with one producer and exporter in a long term relationship, where we can make a big impact. However the two superheroes for Bolivian specialty coffee is our exporter and producers Pedro and Daniela Rodriguez. Daniela and Pedro Rodriguez Our goal is just to get a tastier cup of coffee, but if we can do this and make a positive impact its a win-win situation.

 Figured we hadn't posted the video from the Nordic Roaster Forum November 2015 in Copenhagen just yet. The talk is not perfect at all, however it sums up alot about our roasting philosophy.  As said in the beginning, knowledge in coffee roasting is developing so quickly and all we can promise year after year is that we're consistently trying to create a better cup of coffee.  Giving this talk, we did not yet have a reader for exhausted temperature and currently we're looking into consistent airflow. However, the philosophy is staying the same: a coffee with a clear taste profile with a lot...
 I just placed forth in the World Coffee Roasting Championship in Shanghai, China.  Placing third in the world in the world in 2014 (Rimini) and second in the world 2015 (Gothenburg) the expectations were very high. However, this is nothing we're disappointed in at all. This is actually the best competition I've done so far. I was super happy with how I presented the single (Panama), reminding of strawberry lemonade and citric. The blend I created with 80% Santuario from Cauca since it simply was stunning; vibrant, juicy and a surgery sweetness. For the rest of the blend I was using...

			Our espresso philosophy is simple: source and roast the coffee best suited for espresso roast. That means we choose based on balance, clarity and lots of sweetness, and roast to bring out the uniqueness of the coffee, where it comes from and the right balance to endure the high pressure brewing required for espresso. Instead of offering complicated blends with meaningless names, we’ve chosen coffee from producers we believe in to give you the best espresso experience. Each of our espresso offerings are single origin and sourced in partnership with the many great producers we collaborate with. Our selection of espresso coffee is ever changing and always reflective of what’s in-season.

 This coffee was a magic carpet ride for us. Starting with the depth of Figs, zigging to the sweetness of a Mango, and zagging to the end with a splash of White Grape Juice. It's a whole new world. 
 Region: Rio NegroFarm: 5 VariousMunicipality: IquiraVarietal: Yellow BourbonAltitude: 1600-1750 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed 
 Yellow Bourbon is a natural cross between Red Bourbon and Amarelo de Botacuto, which is labelled as a Typica variant with yellow fruit. Bourbon resulted from selections made by French botanists in wild Yemeni coffee groves. Moved to controlled fields for propagation, the relatively humble stock produced a remarkable variety and was given the namesake of its nursery - Bourbon Island - upon its introduction to South American. Under expanded cultivation in Brazil, a yellow mutant with a unique flavor profile expressed itself and was isolated, expanded, and named for its color.
 This Variety Select lot comes to us courtesy of five small farmers from the villages surrounding the municipality of Iquira. With volcanic soil, anaverage temperature of 20-25° C, and 160 CM of annual rainfall, this area is extremely conducive to the cultivation of coffee. Generally, these farmers are processing only ripe cherries the same day of harvest using a dry fermentation of 18-24 hours. The coffees are then washed, and dried in parabolicos for an average duration of 12-18 days.

 Lots of love from Ethiopia. Muscovado Sugar and Jasmine start the journey and they fall into a bed of Apricots. We can't stop. 
 Region: Shakiso, OromiaFarm: Kayon Mountain Varietal: TypicaAltitude: 1900–2200 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed & Sun Dried
 The Kayon Mountain Coffee Farm is owned by multiple families that have been born and raised around the experience of coffee. These share-holding members had mainly been supplying coffee to auction for the past 30 years until they started their farm in 2012. This farm boasts a 500 hecatarespread, of which half is planted in heriloom Typica coffee and the other land reserved for cabbage, and indigenous shade trees. By 2015, they had implimented washing stations and dry-hullers allowing them to start exporting their own coffees and now see an annual production of about 300 tonnes. The coffees see an average fermentation time of 24-26 hours, followed by an average drying time of 12-20 days. As for the future, Kayon Mountain plans to plant more coffee, improve the quality of their processing, and even begin leasing more land to expand their practice.
 The ECX was started in 2008 to help protect farmers from market forces that might prevent them from making a living. Most of the coffee in Ethiopia is produced by small-holders who own 0.7 hectares, bumper crops often lead to big price drops, which can make it unprofitable for farmers to harvest their coffee. What the ECX does is commoditize grains- including sesame, beans, maize, wheat, and most importantly, coffee. This ensures prompt payment to farmers. It also integrates all parts of the “eco-system” involved in a grains market, including warehousing, grading, trading, and payment. Access to information is emphasized, as farmers can obtain information about trading prices and local delivery points easily through dedicated telephone lines.
 Here is a general rundown of how the ECX chain works in Ethiopia:
 While this system does ensure prompt payment and streamlines supply chain issues, it removes essentially all traceability from the coffee. This is problematic in the specialty world, where traceability is paramount.
 The ECX does not allow for complete traceability, but coffee cooperatives in Ethiopia do have the ability to go around the ECX and export the coffee themselves. Coffees that are exported by a cooperative can have traceability, possibly even to a single farmer.

 Division was designed to exhibit the fervor of mulitple elements in alliance, creating a rich & complex profile of dark sugars. We crafted this offering on the foundation of rich chocolate and caramel notes with just enough sweet, dark fruit overtones to make it an exceptionally versatile coffee. Primarily intended to serve as a brewed offering, this coffee has been shaped to serve as a Fair-Trade & Organic alternative to Orion, our flagship espresso.
 Division was created to be paired with food. The rich body holds up well against heavier traditional breakfast items. Inversely the fruit tones are held in careful balance to compliment a wide range of pastries and desserts. Although sweetness is clearly present in the cup, it is not overpowering. We created this offering to showcase the versatility of a carefully balanced cup. This makes Division an exceptional choice for cafes and restaurants looking for a “work horse” coffee. We like to think of this offering as the nicest “diner coffee” you will ever find; perfect for bookending your day.
 Although the elements shift occasionally to reflect the seasonality of coffee harvests, we are careful in our selection of what we pair in Division. While looking for rich, sugared tones we make sure we are working with a seasonally rotating selection of reputable cooperatives, known for consistent quality and fair practices.

			Colombia is a very well known and celebrated coffee producing country known for its range of flavour, sweetness and acidity. Coffee is an important part of its history, with many of the coffee growing regions in the country listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites. We’ve been sourcing coffee from Colombia since 2010 and have focused on building relationships with producers in the Huila region, one of the most notable for quality. This has led to some great relationships, like with our long-time friends the Guzman Brothers.
		
 Coffee in Colombia, though very exciting, can be quite a challenge as many farms in the country value yield over quality processing. This can traced back to federally funded programs aimed at increasing production. These programs are beneficial for many producers but aren’t always the best strategy for inciting quality coffee producers. The programs often focus on fast and hot drying systems, which are quite damaging to quality coffees and negatively affects their shelf life. What gets us going when it comes to Colombian coffees are the relationships that we’ve been able to develop with producers who are truly interested in improving quality and are passionate about their product. Kindred spirits, if you will. This is what we’ve found in the Guzman  Brothers.
 Audenar, Alirio and Abelardo Guzman have been our partners and friends since 2010, and have implemented projects to improve picking coffee cherry, processing, drying and storage. We’ve helped them design and build raised drying structures that optimize conditions by shading the coffee and improving the air-flow. Each brother monitors the drying coffee five times a day in order to achieve the ideal moistures and water activity. To protect their coffee from high humidity and temperatures, they store everything in GrainPro at their farm until they can make a delivery. This diligent work has led to some outstanding results and provided us with our best Colombian coffees for the past two years. In order to show our appreciation, we enthusiastically agreed to a three-year contract, committing us to buy all the quality coffee they produce.
 We’re also in the process of seeking out more producers who are interested in working with us to improve the quality of their coffee. A challenge, yes, but we’ve been inspired by what we accomplished with the Guzmans and hope to repeat the success story.

	We've been proudly featuring Fair Trade/Organic coffees since 1999 and throughout that time we've developed longstanding relationships with a number of co-ops that provide us with exemplary coffee year after year.
			
 Cupping notes : Sweet-smoky, Tamarind, Layered
Roast level : DARK
 Our Organic Colombia Tolima comes from the municipality of Planadas in the southern tip of the Tolima Province. Lying in the foothills of the Central Andes, Tolima is known for its mineral-rich soils and fresh water. Though relatively unknown in the coffee industry until recently, Tolima is now the country’s third largest coffee producer and is increasingly being recognized for producing great tasting coffee.
 The beans in this lot come from two small cooperatives in Planadas: ASOPAP and Resguardo Indígena Nasa We’sx.
 The 29 members of the ASOPAP cooperative are fully committed to quality coffee and organic standards from their farms, which are situated at 5,400-6,200 feet. Their beans have yielded excellent cup profiles for some time, drawing attention from international coffee traders.
 The Nasa We’sx are an indigenous community brought to Planadas in the early 1900s by the Colombian Army as a mine workforce. For decades, they were caught in the conflict between the army and the largest guerilla group in the country, FARC, until recently, when they made a peace pact with local guerrillas.
 Cupping notes : Smooth smoke,  Caramelized sugar, Silky body
Roast level : DARK
 This is our darkest Fair Trade/Organic certified blend. We thoughtfully selected the coffees that make up this blend in order to maintain some of their individual aroma and flavor attributes while standing up to the intensity of the unique way that we roast them. The result is a dark roasted coffee with smoky flavor, peppery body and just a hint of caramelized sugars ; a perfect way to ease into your morning and a great complement to an evening meal.
 Cupping notes : Sweet Chocolate, Sweet Caramel, Fruit toned acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Originally created as the companion to our Golden Gate House Blend, this espresso has a sweet chocolate flavor complimented by notes of fruit and caramel along with a well balanced acidity. It is a harmonious blend of Fair Trade and Organic certified coffees.
 Cupping notes : Chocolate, Sweet Caramel, Fruit toned acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Whether approaching by sea or from within the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Strait imbues a sense of magic and wonder. The stunning landscapes and picture perfect sunsets inspired us here at Mr. Espresso to create a blend that attempts to capture its grace and majesty. Dark chocolate, sweet caramel and fruit toned acidity seamlessly blend together to create our homage to this wonder of nature.
 Cupping notes : Strawberry jam, Milk chocolate, Currant
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Guaya’b is a cooperative of over 300 indigenous Mayan and Quichua farming families in the region of Jacaltenango, Huehuetenango. Since the introduction of coffee into the Jacaltenango region 40 years ago natural habitats, flora and fauna have slowly made a comeback from the once de-forested land. The recreation of the natural habitat has allowed for the reduction of soil erosion, restored natural habits and given the coffee crops a lush canopy that allows them to ripen slowly. Rich & delicately fruity; you’ll experience a thought provoking brew that begins with a chewy, chocolaty body that develops into a strawberry jaminess infused with deeper, bright fruit tones that suggest currant and raspberry.
 Cupping notes : Red danjou pear, Raspberry honey, Malt-like body
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Situated deep in the interior folds of the Southern Sierra Madre Mountains in Chiapas, Mexico is the coffee growing cooperative of Ramal Santa Cruz. Among this multitude of coffee farms lies the home of Augustin Sanchez Espinoza and his three brothers who all farm together on adjacent parcels of land. The farms of the Brothers Sanchez are at the upper reaches of viable coffee cultivation, starting at 1600 meters and topping at just over 1800 meters, the highest of all coffee grown in the cooperative. The family began planting coffee on the land in the early 1970s. Many of the original plants are still producing. The majority of the coffee is Typica and Bourbon with a scattering of more recently planted Caturra.
 The coffee from these four brothers and their farms make up our Mexico Fair Trade, Organic, Ramal Santa Cruz , Cuatro Hermanos.  This coffee greets you with a  red danjou pear citrus acidity followed with hints of raspberry honey and Meyer lemon.  We hope you will enjoy this extraordinarily smooth coffee from the Cuatro Hermanos.
 Cupping notes : Rich chocolate, Hazelnut, Mellow acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Our goal with Organic Neapolitan was to create an espresso blend that contained similar attributes as our conventional Neapolitan using only coffees that are Fair Trade certified and grown without the use of agrichemicals.

Perfectly balanced in milk drinks and alive with flavor as a straight shot.

 Why you’ll love it: Sweet and refined, this bright Ethiopian coffee will please the perfectionist in all of us.
 Story of the bean: Yirg for Yirgacheffe, Z for zero defect. Ethiopian coffees from the Yirgacheffe region are world-renowned for producing distinctively floral and aromatic coffee. "Zero defect" means this coffee is triple sorted by size, color, and density until it reaches a point of near perfection. This new harvest is on a new level of coffee obsession. The mountains and soil of the Yirgacheffe region are known for producing coffees with floral and citrus aromas. Our importing partner, Samuel Demisse, has amplified this reputation by employing a rigorous sorting process in Ethiopia.
 Workers at the mill are paid well to sort the coffee seeds by hand, meaning only the very best beans make it to La Colombe. This pure expression of these Heirloom varietal results in a coffee with the clean, pronounced taste of traditional Yirgacheffe coffees.

REGION: Antigua Valley
VARIETAL: Bourbon + Caturra
FARM: Buena Vista Mill
ALTITUDE: 1660 M
FARMER: Luis Pedro Zelaya 
ROAST: Medium 
NOTES: Peaberry
 
Our newest peaberry is packed with sweet and bright flavors of hazelnut and lime along with subtle hints of milk chocolate, dried apricot, raisin and vanilla in aroma and cup. 

	Antigua Valley is perfect for cultivating coffee, with ample rainfall, altitude above 4,900 feet and a constant humidity of 65% -- making Antigua coffee number one in Guatemala.
	
	Luis Pedro Zelaya is a fourth generation coffee farmer working in the heart of the well-known Antigua region. Managing the renowned Beneficio Bella Vista and many other well-known farms in the area, Luis Pedro has produced some truly exceptional coffees over the years. This past year, he built an incredible greenhouse to dry the coffee, which is an improvement over the usual patio setup. 
	
	Peaberry, a type of coffee bean. Normally the fruit (“cherry”) of the coffee plant contains two seeds (“beans”) that develop with flattened facing sides, but sometimes only one of the two seeds is fertilized, and the single seed develops with nothing to flatten it. This oval (or pea-shaped) bean is known as peaberry. Typically around 5% of all coffee beans harvested are of this form.

VARIETAL: Typica + Bourbon
FARM: Las Serranias
ALTITUDE: 1500 M
FARMER: Various
ROAST: Medium
NOTES: 89 points by Coffee Review

 
	This is a "natural" processed decaffeinated coffee or otherwise known as the sugar cane method. Let us take you to Dorkville real quick to provide some insight one what this specific decaffeination process is and how it affects the overall flavor of the coffee. Basically there are four basic decaffeination process that we know of or have been introduced so far. They are the Direct Solvent, Indirect Solvent, Swiss Water and Co2.  
	
	For this specific coffee, we're going to focus on the Solvent based process. Now don't freak out. Let us expand on what this process actually is. To simplify, this processes is when the caffeine is removed from the beans with the help of a chemical solvent, such as methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. Those solvent based processes in turn can be divided into methods using the “direct” method and the “indirect” method. 
	
	This specific coffee goes through the "indirect" process. What that mean is, instead of applying the solvent chemical directly onto the beans, the beans are soaked in near boiling water for several hours, which extracts the caffeine as well as other flavor elements and oils from the beans. The water is then separated and transferred to another tank where the beans are washed for about 10 hours with either methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. The molecules of the chemical solvent selectively bond with the molecules of caffeine and the resulting mixture is then heated to evaporate the solvent and caffeine.
	
	Lastly, the beans are reintroduced to the liquid to reabsorb most of the coffee oils and flavor elements.
However, because of the impracticality of gathering natural ethyl acetate and its cost, the chemical used for decaffeination appears to be synthetic. Ethyl acetate is produced commercially from ethyl alcohol and acetic acid, which in turn may be produced from natural ingredients or petroleum derivatives.
In the direct method caffeine is removed by soaking the materials directly in a solvent; the solvent is directly applied to the beans. 
	
	Las Serranias is graded "A" decaffeinated process that uses a derivative from sugar-cane known as Ethel Acetate (EA). The pleasing characteristic from the sugar cane adds to the sweet acidity and banana, apricot and cream notes. More importantly, It's not giving the dirty flavors most decaffeinated coffees are associated with. Overall, it's a well structured, smooth, and balanced coffee.
	
	Although Las Serranias is not a part of the Las Mingas Project directly, it was produce by the founders. Las Mingas Project promotes coffee relatinships, a partnership that brings producers, exporters, and roasters together to collaborate. Giving farmers bargaining power and receive honest pricing for trading practices. La Serrania came directly from Virmax, a premier exporter of Colombian Specialty Coffees that works under Direct Relationship model. 
	
	Without a doubt, decaf drinker or not, you will appreciate and adore Las Serranias. Kenneth Davids from Coffee Review scored Las Serranias 89 points and stated this decaf as "delicately rich and fruit-toned. In the aroma distinct cocoaish chocolate complicated by fresh-cut fir. In the cup soft, wine-like acidity, lightly syrupy mouthfeel, and continued fruit-inflected chocolate."

 Our San Sebastian Reserva combines lots--selected from hundreds cupped--from producers in San Sebastian De La Plata, Huila. These producers farm at elevations above 1,700 meters on three hillsides surrounding the community of La Plata. After manual de-pulping, their coffee beans are fermented in tanks for up to 24 hours before being washed and laid to sun dry on parabolic beds. The creation of San Sebastian Reserva project intended to develop lasting, quality-focused relationships between farmer and roaster. In order to ensure that we are working in tandem with our growers, the project incorporates a staff cupper in Colombia who works with both farmer and roaster; hundreds of samples of coffees fresh from harvest sent to Olympia Coffee to be cupped every week throughout the two growing seasons in La Plata; and multiple farm visits from the staff of Olympia Coffee.

 Occasional bits of deliciousness from your friends at Blue Bottle.
 Jun. 16, 2016 - Story by Kelly Sanchez
 Quality Control Specialist Kelly Sanchez makes sense of five popular brewing methods.
 We made our Green Coffee Buyer unpack his travel bag, because we wanted to find out what a coffee buyer takes with him on his trips to more than a dozen countries a year. Here’s what we found.

 When we first tried the coffee that Mokhtar Alkhanshali brought us from Yemen, it stopped Blue Bottle Coffee founder James Freeman in his tracks, and we’ve been counting the days until we could share this veritable coffee miracle from Yemen with our guests.
 Judith is our Quality Control Specialist, which means she’s tasked with tasting, testing, and troubleshooting every single coffee we offer, every single day. You may have seen her in the cupping room at our Oakland roastery, circling around the cupping table.
 After all, you can't create a painting without the proper canvas and base, and you can't build a warm, hospitable, community-creating cafe experience without music.

 May. 12, 2016 - Story by Charlie Habegger
 "Coffee should taste like what it is: a tropical fruit seed, separated and cleaned of the flesh, dried, roasted until caramelized, and then crushed and extracted into water." – Charlie Habegger, Green Coffee Buyer
 On a sunny Tuesday morning, printmaker Carissa Potter and painter-baker Leah Rosenberg get together in Carissa’s Oakland kitchen and studio to discuss their creative collaboration This, That, & Hours in the Sun.
 You can stick with the basics and get a lot of mileage out of your AeroPress, but you can also experiment with tools and techniques for countless variations on your morning cup. Here are three ideas.
 Did we ever think we would set up shop in the desert for some 200,000 guests? No, not even close.

 Many shots were pulled, pitchers steamed, and miles traveled by our intrepid Blue Bottle baristas on their journey to the U.S. Coffee Championships.
 Hedy Macferran, Director of Culinary at Blue Bottle Coffee, shares her travel philosophy, the food she loves, and why she thinks everyone should take time to travel alone.
 A day ends at the stroke of midnight, but for many of us who labor over creative pursuits, it’s hard to say exactly when a project is finished.

 The Chemex's design has remained completely unchanged (right down to its charming wood handle and leather cord) since its invention in 1941 by a German inventor named Peter Schlumbohm. Schlumbohm's designs were once characterized as “a synthesis of logic and madness”, and we're inclined to agree. Equal parts brilliance and common sense, the Chemex remains a staple in every coffee enthusiast's arsenal. Coffee from a Chemex is very similar to drip coffee, except that there’s more room for error. In order to guarantee the best results, make sure you’ve ground your coffee a bit coarser than in a ceramic dripper (there is, after all, more of it), and that you’ve given extra attention to your rate of pour. The upside? You can make enough to share with friends.

 Bring to a boil twice as much water as you’ll need for the actual brewing (around 1,200-1,400 grams for a 6-cup Chemex).
 Weigh out about 50-60 grams of coffee (or approximately four or five tablespoons of beans).
 While the water is heating, grind your coffee. The grind should be about as coarse as that of a French press.
 Unfold your filter and place it in your Chemex, insuring the triple-fold portion is facing the pour spout and lays across it without obstructing it.
 Pour in some of the extra water, fully saturating the filter and warming the glass. After about a minute, you can pour this water into your cup to heat that, too.
 Pour your ground coffee into the filter and give it a gentle shake. This will flatten the bed, allowing for a more even pour.
 Starting at the bed’s center, gently pour twice the amount of water that you have coffee into your grounds – for example, 100 grams of water for 50 grams of coffee. Work your way outward gently, and avoid pouring down the sides of the filter.
 Allow the coffee to expand, or “bloom” for between 30 and 45 seconds. A solid bloom will ensure even water dispersion – and a delicious cup later on.
 Continue pouring – delicately, beautifully – into the center of the grounds. You should pour at such a rate that the complete brew process takes about four minutes. Drink your coffee. Marvel at your dedication and skill. Repeat if necessary.
 Copper plated with a clear-coated interior to prevent any 
tarnishing, this elegant kettle takes a shine to any kitchen. The narrow spout allows for a slow and precise pour. 
 The Hario’s beautiful copper gooseneck spout offers even more pour 
control. Equally impressive in its beauty and performance.

 
              Nuanced and versatile, the Hario is an elegant brewer for those who want to perfect the pour. It’s great for folks who are looking for complete control over brewing extraction. The key here is to pour slow. The entire brew process for a 10oz mug takes about three minutes.

 Why you'll love it: With stunning notes of hibiscus and asian pear, this coffee is tropical and complex. 
 Story of the bean: This geisha coffee contains unique flavors caused by the "natural" processing method, during which coffee beans are dried inside the fruit of the coffee cherry. Producer Roberto Brenes and his team at La Aurora farm know that the longer the beans are able to soak up the juices, the stronger the fruit notes will be, so they rest these beans inside their fruit for 45-60 days. Infused with all that sweetness and complexity, this coffee presents the vivid flavors and aromas of origin, providing a full sensory experience that transports to you to a Panamanian coffee farm.

 This year’s coffee trip to Guatemala proved to be a very exciting and productive visit. Our friends at TG Labs in Guatemala City recently began managing a wet mill in Antigua called La Esperanza. TG Labs bring a wide range of expertise in traceability and quality development to a real scenario through this actual mill run by them. Via La Esperanza, their team is able to extend best practices for recommended processing to the final cup, monitoring every step and bringing the most potential of the farmers to the buyers. 
 This particular farm, simply named Lago (Lake) after Lago Atitalan where it is located, is owned and run by Juan Perez. Three years ago, Juan was introduced to TG Labs and became interested in their programs promoting traceability and quality development. Conditions around the lake are not great for processing or drying, so with the management of La Esperanza, TG Labs is now able to process coffee cherries from Lago in Antigua under superior conditions and strict controls. Generally harvesting coffee from November to March, Lago produces about two containers per harvest of Caturra and Bourbon between coffee 1,500 and 1,800 meters above sea level. We at Joe are honored to be among the first buyers to taste the final product of this inspired collaboration.
 All orders are roasted on Monday and Thursday and are shipped on the same day. Note that if you order Two-Day Shipping after 7am on any given day, your order will be processed *the following roast day*. We do this to ensure your coffee arrives to you as fresh as possible!
 All coffee is delivered whole bean. If you need your order ground, please specify your brew method in the special instructions section.

 The Sermon has always been a new take on an old classic. A round body, heavy chocolate notes and berry sweetness are what we consistently strive for. We find coffees that suit this profile and create a blend that focuses on flavor, and highlights coffees from East Africa and South America. Fazenda Aurea a dry-processed Catuai from Brazil, offers a sturdy body and is a great background, while a perfect Guji dry-processed Ethiopia provides an intense berry note. Balancing out these extremes is a coffee from Colombia made up of smallholder farmers' coffees from the northern Cauca region; known for being clean, sweet and full of ripe fruit flavors. All together they yield an espresso that is both exciting and approachable.
 The Sermon excels on a wide variety of espresso machine types (including the old-school, vintage lever machine types). We use a relatively standard approach on our more modern equipment. The Sermon is versatile, so a shorter shot tastes great too. Some folks also like to use the blend on their coffee brewer or press pot for a deep cup.

 3 bags once a month, or 1 bag every 2 weeks, you choose how much espresso you need and how often. We'll send out espressos that we think are the best right now. Coffees will ship fresh and are roasted to order. On top of that, all of our coffees are nitrogen flushed and vacuum sealed to ensure that once you receive your coffee, it stays fresh. Simple as that. 
 Rather than paying a large upfront cost - you are billed with each shipment. This allows you to make changes to your subscription as you please!
 Each week, we will decide what espresso we are most excited about. Sometimes there will be Single Origin Espressos that only our subscribers will get access to. This is a curated, espresso program that you can increase, or decrease the frequency and/or the quantity of coffee you receive. You can put the subscription on pause if you are going on vacation, or cancel if you need to. You are in complete control, and you'll never be without espresso in the house.

 La Gaitana is a micro blend of coffees from various producers near small towns such as Timana, Palestina and Pitalito in South Huila. The majority of specialty coffee exported from Colombia comes from this region, and also hosts various Cup of Excellence winners. The average farm size here is 3-4 hectares, producing coffee almost year round. The most common varietals in this region are Castillo, Caturra and Typica. We named this micro blend after the chief who led the resistance against the Spanish invaders in South Huilla during the 16th century.

 Lots of love from Ethiopia. Muscovado Sugar and Jasmine start the journey and they fall into a bed of Apricots. We can't stop. 
 Region: Shakiso, OromiaFarm: Kayon Mountain Varietal: TypicaAltitude: 1900–2200 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed & Sun Dried
 The Kayon Mountain Coffee Farm is owned by multiple families that have been born and raised around the experience of coffee. These share-holding members had mainly been supplying coffee to auction for the past 30 years until they started their farm in 2012. This farm boasts a 500 hecatarespread, of which half is planted in heriloom Typica coffee and the other land reserved for cabbage, and indigenous shade trees. By 2015, they had implimented washing stations and dry-hullers allowing them to start exporting their own coffees and now see an annual production of about 300 tonnes. The coffees see an average fermentation time of 24-26 hours, followed by an average drying time of 12-20 days. As for the future, Kayon Mountain plans to plant more coffee, improve the quality of their processing, and even begin leasing more land to expand their practice.
 The ECX was started in 2008 to help protect farmers from market forces that might prevent them from making a living. Most of the coffee in Ethiopia is produced by small-holders who own 0.7 hectares, bumper crops often lead to big price drops, which can make it unprofitable for farmers to harvest their coffee. What the ECX does is commoditize grains- including sesame, beans, maize, wheat, and most importantly, coffee. This ensures prompt payment to farmers. It also integrates all parts of the “eco-system” involved in a grains market, including warehousing, grading, trading, and payment. Access to information is emphasized, as farmers can obtain information about trading prices and local delivery points easily through dedicated telephone lines.
 Here is a general rundown of how the ECX chain works in Ethiopia:
 While this system does ensure prompt payment and streamlines supply chain issues, it removes essentially all traceability from the coffee. This is problematic in the specialty world, where traceability is paramount.
 The ECX does not allow for complete traceability, but coffee cooperatives in Ethiopia do have the ability to go around the ECX and export the coffee themselves. Coffees that are exported by a cooperative can have traceability, possibly even to a single farmer.

 These blends reflect the freshest coffees of the season. 123°W Longitude Blend is a medium roast and French is for those who enjoy dark roasts.
 
			Known for a unique quality of processing and drying, coffee from Kenya is very exciting. It’s washed and soaked twice in a style called “Double Fermentation” and then dried on raised beds. As with all styles of processing, when done well it can yield unparalleled results. We’ve been traveling to Kenya ourselves since 2011 and over the years, have had the privilege of many of their phenomenal coffees passing through our roasterie.
		
 Coffee production in Kenya is handled mainly by co-ops, and every factory or washing station sorts its coffee by bean size, with AA being the largest. Many in Kenya believe that the larger the coffee bean, the higher the quality, which drives prices much higher for those given the AA grade. While this is often the case, we believe that the AB coffees can be just as good.
 Kenyan coffee runs on a well-established auction system. Each week, all the bidding exporters will cup and taste over 1500 coffees to decide which ones to buy through the auction. Although it’s a strong system for buying coffee, our preference is always to work more directly with particular factories year after year. Thankfully, great exporting companies like Dormans Coffee allow us direct access through their sister company Coffee Management Services (CMS) to all the lots of particular top factories or washing stations that we enjoy. We pay a premium for these coffees (higher than auction prices) but we believe it’s well worth it for the chance to have the same Kenyan coffees every year.

 Stir vigorously with your spoon or stir stick. This is to ensure all coffee is evenly saturated.
 Allow 20 seconds for a de-gas and then start pouring slowly into the center. To prevent water from escaping without extracting the coffee, your pour should be slow and your water line should not go far above the coffee line.
 When you have reached 360 grams of water, do a last stir to get the grounds off the side & do not leave any coffee high and dry!
 Your pour should take 1 min and 50 second or up to 2 min and you total contact time should be 2:20 to 2:30

		    In addition to our Italian style blends, feel free to experiment with our Single Origins and Blends to make a distinct espresso with an additional layer of verve and intrigue. 
		    
 Cupping notes : Sweet Chocolate, Sweet Caramel, Fruit toned acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Originally created as the companion to our Golden Gate House Blend, this espresso has a sweet chocolate flavor complimented by notes of fruit and caramel along with a well balanced acidity. It is a harmonious blend of Fair Trade and Organic certified coffees.
 Cupping notes : Bittersweet chocolate, Hazelnut, Caramel candy
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Surrounded by the sights and smells of the region during his youth, Mr. Espresso’s founder, Carlo Di Ruocco, set out to master the art and science behind coffee roasting and blending of classic espressos true to the region. We believe he did just that, and today Mr. Espresso is proud to offer Carlo’s interpretation of a timeless classic. True to its roots, Neapolitan Espresso is sure to delight the senses whether it is prepared at home with a stove-top “Caffettiera Napoletana” or expertly crafted at your neighborhood espresso bar.
 Cupping notes : Rich chocolate, Praline, Toffee
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Our goal with Organic Neapolitan was to create an espresso blend that contained similar attributes as our conventional Neapolitan using only coffees that are Fair Trade certified and grown without the use of agrichemicals. Complex, intense and rich in both flavor and aroma, Organic Neapolitan Espresso is the perfect balance of taste and social responsibility.
 Cupping notes : Meyer lemon, Brazil nut, Cocoa finish
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 “Triestino” Espresso refers to Trieste, Italy – which is the capital city of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region in Northeast Italy. The Port of Trieste is Italy’s and one of Europe’s great coffee ports, supplying more than 40% of Italy’s coffee.   Lighter bodied than our more traditional espresso blends with a smooth body and creamy mouthfeel; the rich nut-toned cocoa flavors of this blend are accented by lively fruit notes.  The flavor profile of the Espresso Triestino is inspired by the style of espresso which is normally consumed in this region.
 Cupping notes : Rich chocolate flavor, Stunning aromatics and Sweet resonant finish.
Roast level : MEDIUM
 “Tuscan Espresso” refers to the region of Tuscany, Italy – which is known for its role as the birthplace of the Renaissance, simple yet wonderful cuisine, and a wine producing region to which the Napa Valley is often compared to for both quality and beauty.  The flavor profile of our Tuscan Espresso is inspired by the style of espresso which is normally consumed in this region.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Licorice, Caramel
Roast level : MEDIUM
 If you are anything like us, the urge for an espresso can hit you at just about anytime day or night. With this in mind, we searched out and found the decaffeinated coffee dreams are made of (or at least allows for the sleep to dream). The rich golden crema, syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of licorice and caramel might just change your mind about how good a decaf can be. This is the perfect blend to pair with a dessert, or as one. Feel the freedom to indulge.
 Cupping notes : Cocoa-caramel, Fruit-tones, bold body
Roast level : MEDIUM
 The challenge in creating a blend that reflects the ideal characteristics of a truly delicious espresso is too often compounded by the availability and quality of the decaffeinated coffees on the market. Organic Decaffeinated Espresso is a challenge met. Thick, golden crema and cocoa-caramel aromatics that follow into the cup with distinct, yet subtle fruit notes. Perfectly balanced in milk drinks and alive with flavor as a straight shot.

 Huckleberry · Orange Blossom · Juicy  
 This variant is currently sold out
 Please fill in the form below if you'd like to be notified when it becomes available.
 Tart and concentrated, this honey-processed Gesha exhibits both the intensely sweet and juicy qualities of huckleberry with a hallmark Gesha florality akin to orange blossom.
 The Gesha Cultivar is considered by many coffee professionals, connoisseurs, and enthusiasts to be the most intense, complex, brilliant cultivar ever discovered. Though Gesha gained its current acclaim from crops cultivated in Panama, its origin can be traced back to the fertile land on the slopes of southwest Ethiopia. From the birthplace of coffee, Gesha was transported across the world’s foremost coffee producing countries, finally landing on the shores of Central America in the 30s. Because of its unique traits from plant to cup, Gesha has built an unparalleled name for itself, and now we have access to the greatest cultivar ever discovered grown on some of the world’s greatest farms.
 "A place very far away and hard to get to", as defines the word "Jurutungo," is the name of Graciano Cruz' farm in Western Panama.
 In the seventies, Jurutungo was a freshly planted farm in western Panama near the Costa Rican border in a region called Piedra Candela. Jurutungo was planted with Catuai, Caturra and a modest hectare of the Gesha variety.
 In 2009, Graciano Cruz took over the overgrown farm and reinvigorated the land by stumping the existing trees and allowing them to regrow. The result; the rebirth of some of the world’s oldest gesha trees on one of the highest farms in Panama.
 A North American exclusive offering, Evelia Maria Honey Gesha celebrates “old-vine” character and terroir of one of the most intriguing farms we’ve come across to date.

 Yukro joins our menu for the first time and its addition highlights the diversity of Ethiopia's growing regions. Yukro is located in Ethiopia's western region of Jimma. Though situated in the remote west, Yukro is a strongly supported cooperative due to the investment of an international non-profit, TechnoServe. TechnoServe's mission is to support impoverished agricultural communities by providing business advisory and funding. In the case of Yukro, TechnoServe has aided quality through the hiring of agronomists and cooperative management. Yukro shines in the cup: heavily sugared flavors accented by bergamot and black tea are in harmonious balance.
 Fresh coffee is roasted on Sundays and Wednesdays and shipped the following day. Please place your order by 8:00 PM Eastern Time the evening before the respective roast day to ensure that it is included.

 1650 - 1750 masl. In full sun.
 
							The coffee is selectively hand picked by hired pickers under
supervision of Elias. Cherries are hand sorted before they are
processed to make sure only ripe cherries are processed together.
After depulping the parchment coffee is rinsed in clean water.
Then the water is drained and the parchment is fermented for
14 to 16 hours. After fermentation the coffee is washed in clean
water that is changed 4 times. All ﬂoaters are removed during
the washing. The Parchment is soaked for 24 hours in clean
water before it is dried in parabolic dryers under shade from 25 - 35 days.						
 We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our light roasted coffees are suited for all brew methods except espresso. The roast level gives a cup with clarity, brightness and sweetness with little  bitterness and ashy flavors from the roast process.

If brewed as espresso on an espresso machine, the lighter roast style will result in a cup with a very high level of acidity due to the highly concentrated brew. We therefore recommend using our slightly darker roasted coffees for making espresso.
 All our coffees are packed in vacuum sealed, recyclable plastic bags that are flushed with nitrogen before sealing. The bags has a one way valve to let the coffee de-gas while quality is kept in the sealed bag.

When the coffee is roasted it develops a lot of CO2 gas inside the beans. This gas will make the coffee taste smokey and ashy immediately after roasting. It is absolutely crucial to let the coffee degas and rest for a while before use to ensure maximum flavour.

We recommend storing / degassing our ligher roasted coffees for minimum 3 to 5 days after the date of roast , sealed in the original bag at room temperature, before you use it.

Make sure you store it in a dark place at around 14°C - 20°C, away from any heat, moisture or light. The coffee has lost most of its sweetness and aroma 3-4 weeks after the day of roast, so make sure you use it before it is too late.

You can find the roast date and batch number on all our coffees in the bottom right corner of the front label on the bags. 
 We strongly recommend to use correct measurments and brewing techniques when you brew our coffees. Use a digital scale both to measure water and coffee in order to get consistent results.

We recommend to use between 60 to 70 grams of coffee per litre (1000g) of water, depending on the brewing method, water quality and coffee used. 
 It’s high time we wrote a little something about our single origin mochas at our newest location on Hawthorne.  Many people know us for our extremely limited menu at our tasting room that does not offer any syrups or additives to our beverages.  We’re passionate about showcasing single origin coffees that give credit and honor back to the producers.  When we opened our second cafe we knew it would be more of a neighborhood shop. We knew that if we were going to offer a mocha, it had to be really special.
 Since Coava started in 2008 we’ve been partnering with the folks at Cocanu, providing them with coffee to use in their chocolates. With this relationship already established it seemed like a no-brainer to partner with them for the chocolate used in our mochas and hot chocolates. With this in mind, Cocanu began manufacturing a line of single origin chocolates that is pulverized into a powder so that it can be incorporated into milk drinks without losing the qualities and unique flavor profile of the chocolate itself.
 The chocolate in Cloudforest is a 70% dark Ecuadorian chocolate that is rich and earthy with a guava sweetness. These taste notes, paired with any of our single origin espressos translate into a delicious and balanced drink that stays true to both the chocolate and coffee producers without one overshadowing the other.
 To create these mochas we melt 28 grams of shaved chocolate into the cup and mix it, by hand, into the espresso. Come see this display of craftsmanship at 2631 Hawthorne Blvd. and treat yourself to a delicious mocha.

	Over the last decades, quality coffee production in Rwanda has advanced substantially. Since being decimated by civil war and strife, coffee has become a major export in Rwanda, where more than three-quarters of its citizens subsist through agriculture. Investment in infrastructure to process coffee and close work with growers has increased production of specialty coffee, work aided by non-profit and government funded programs, some of which was advised by professionals in specialty coffee. Kanzu the Cooperative  has had the support of Technoserve, an organization that was also involved in Mutovu and Yukro. It certainly helps that Rwanda’s terrain is very mountainous, with the high elevations, healthy ecosystems and nutrient rich soil beneficial to quality production.
 
	The Kanzu name refers both to the cooperative and the washing station. Kanzu rests in a valley betwixt mountain peaks near the shores of Lake Kivu. Founded in 2006 with the aid of Technoserve, Kanzu brings together the coffee from hundreds of farmers who harvest fruit from trees cultivated on the mountains above and deliver ripe cherry for processing. Old-growth bourbon trees and terroir of the Nyamasheke region provide the backbone for this coffee with powerful character and acidity, while a 24 hour fermentation process adds complexity. After harvest and drying in March-July, this coffee then faces an epically long journey from land-locked Rwanda here to the USA.
 
	Lush, deeply fruited, and juicy, Kanzu is vivid, clear and clean. This marks our third consecutive season purchasing coffee from the Nyamasheke region. This dynamic coffee represents the potential for high-quality in Rwanda, and elsewhere in Africa where excellent terroir can be at odds with challenges in infrastructure and government which make uncovering coffees like Kanzu difficult. We’re very excited to offer this coffee for Winter and Spring.

 Dario Quilindo is a producer in the Huila Dept of Colombia. This is a micro-lot that has seen its second export to the United States in 2016. The coffee was imported through Coffee Shrub and Bar Nine has committed to the entire production of the micro-lot, making it exclusively available through us this year.
 Our roast days are Monday and Wednesday. All coffee is roasted to order and ships one day after the day it was roasted.
 ﻿All of our coffee is now flushed with nitrogen when bagged, creating an inert atmosphere that improves freshness. An unopened bag of coffee can now retain freshness for 4+ weeks.

We are, however, the first and only roaster in the United States to roast coffee beans exclusively over a fire fueled by Oak Wood. The differences are not what one might initially expect. Unlike cooking with a wood oven or grill, where the smoke from the wood imparts a flavor to the final product, the main difference between wood and conventional roasting lies in the quality of the heat delivered to the beans. Heat derived from wood has higher moisture content and is better suited for slow roasting.
 The more oil preserved within the bean, the more exquisite the final flavor will be. The natural humidity within the wood seems to envelop the beans during the roasting process, hence preserving more of the lipids within. Meanwhile, the slow roasting aspect ensures the coffee is lower in acidity and higher in body. The result is most apparent in our espresso, yielding more crema, fuller flavor, and a smoother finish. For drip coffee for which we actually wish to retain the acidity of the coffees, we subject the beans to a faster roasting time.
 The unique advantages of wood roasting do not come without challenges, as the use of such an inconsistent fuel (i.e. wood) creates difficulties in maintaining consistency between roasts. A nightmare for an inexperienced operator, years of experience of roasting with wood are required to develop the intuition and instinct necessary to master the process. Luckily for us, with 30 years of wood roasting under our belt, we are able to claim this as an advantage; since through the unpredictable nature of roasting with wood, we are required to be attentive and obsessive with each and every roast: nothing can replace the skilled guidance of our experienced roasters. However, never the ones to be overconfident, we still go through extra steps to ensure consistency and quality.
 We begin by selecting well seasoned wood from responsible suppliers. We then utilize thermocouple data collected at key locations on the roaster along with VFD motor control, which allows to make fan and drum speed adjustments during the roasting process. The wood smoke emissions are then abated by high powered afterburners which are in full compliance with local air quality standards. Combining these tools with our years of experience, we are able to maintain control of the roasting process with a very high level of consistency. As you can see, wood roasting is an artisan craft where human experience using old world methods, combined with the latest technological advances in roasting, delicately blend art and science. We hope you will enjoy a distinctive coffee experience which is impossible to duplicate.

 Characterized by citrus fruit and subtle berries, Layo Teraga beams with a vibrant acidity and delicate complexity.
 Three hours southeast of Yirgacheffe in the Oromia region of Southern Ethiopia, Uraga is a special woreda that serves as home to the Layo Teraga cooperative. Run by some of the most animated and enthusiastic people we came across during recent Ethiopia travels, it comes as no surprise that this coffee sings with complexity and character every time it lands on our cupping table.
 The Layo Teraga Cooperative is supplied by approximately 500 member smallholder farmers scattered about the staggering altitudes found in Uraga. Ripe coffee cherries are disk-pulped and fermented for 48 hours before dried on raised beds. One of the hallmarks of great Ethiopian coffees, it is to this thorough process that coffees like Layo Teraga owe their cleanliness and delicate complexity.
 Layo Teraga is located in a more arid climate than its neighbor Yirgacheffee. While arid, the area is loaded with semi-forested areas which allow for ample shade to give the trees respite from the sun. These attributes head led to an extremely dynamic flavor profile.

 The wheels of fate turn in mysterious ways. Sometimes they need a little help from us mere mortals. Luis Pedro Zelaya Zamora is one of those guys who greases the wheels.
 It’s been six years since we met, and every year we’re more impressed with the great Guatemalan coffees he helps us find. Along with the farms run by his family, he keeps his Bella Vista mill (which processes both his family’s coffees and those of his neighbors) in top working order.
 Three years ago, we were in Antigua, cupping with Zelaya. We’d bought from one of his neighbors for a few years straight, and every year they produced a tiny amount of coffee. But that particular year they produced even less than usual. Ever resourceful, Zelaya added some extra, neighboring farms to our cupping.
 His idea was to make sure we’d buy enough coffee to make importing it efficient. But what he got was a couple Four Barrel folks constantly pestering him about this anonymous “neighboring” coffee that blew us away on the cupping table.
 Eventually we discovered that the “neighboring” farmers really were his neighbors‐‐practically next door to Bella Vista.  The Yuc (pronounced “yook”) family farms sit scattered around the Volcan de Agua, and they somehow produce the absolutely exquisite florality we treasure in Guatemalan coffees. Apparently, the wheels of fortune are spinning in our favor.
 The town of Lintong Nihuta sits on the southern shore of Lake Toba in Sumatra, and is home to the hundreds of small farms that produce this coffee. These farms grow Ateng, Djember, and Garundang variety plants. The coffee seeds are processed in the characteristic Indonesia Wet-hulling method. this is an intensely herbal cup with notes of oak, red wine, and black currant.

			Colombia is a very well known and celebrated coffee producing country known for its range of flavour, sweetness and acidity. Coffee is an important part of its history, with many of the coffee growing regions in the country listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites. We’ve been sourcing coffee from Colombia since 2010 and have focused on building relationships with producers in the Huila region, one of the most notable for quality. This has led to some great relationships, like with our long-time friends the Guzman Brothers.
		
 Coffee in Colombia, though very exciting, can be quite a challenge as many farms in the country value yield over quality processing. This can traced back to federally funded programs aimed at increasing production. These programs are beneficial for many producers but aren’t always the best strategy for inciting quality coffee producers. The programs often focus on fast and hot drying systems, which are quite damaging to quality coffees and negatively affects their shelf life. What gets us going when it comes to Colombian coffees are the relationships that we’ve been able to develop with producers who are truly interested in improving quality and are passionate about their product. Kindred spirits, if you will. This is what we’ve found in the Guzman  Brothers.
 Audenar, Alirio and Abelardo Guzman have been our partners and friends since 2010, and have implemented projects to improve picking coffee cherry, processing, drying and storage. We’ve helped them design and build raised drying structures that optimize conditions by shading the coffee and improving the air-flow. Each brother monitors the drying coffee five times a day in order to achieve the ideal moistures and water activity. To protect their coffee from high humidity and temperatures, they store everything in GrainPro at their farm until they can make a delivery. This diligent work has led to some outstanding results and provided us with our best Colombian coffees for the past two years. In order to show our appreciation, we enthusiastically agreed to a three-year contract, committing us to buy all the quality coffee they produce.
 We’re also in the process of seeking out more producers who are interested in working with us to improve the quality of their coffee. A challenge, yes, but we’ve been inspired by what we accomplished with the Guzmans and hope to repeat the success story.

 Grown in Sidamo, right outside Yirgacheffe, Deri is collected from various private washing stations within the region. This lot is purchased out of the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX); as are all private washing station coffees as per Ethiopian law, rendering full traceability dubious at best. The struggle with getting sweet, clean, delicious coffee out of this region absolutely relies on the people working each day, tending to their trees, and only delivering ripe fruit. This is easier said than done when you have countless smallholder farmers to work with, but those who deliver to the washing stations in this region do a fantastic job.
 With lush forests and incredible biodiversity, as well as commitment to quality, this is such a special place. We do hope that one day there will be ability to seek full traceability on lots like these. With the ECX barcode system that is slowly being rolled out as of last year, we are on the way to seeing that happen. 
 With soft honey aromatics, and vibrant flavours of meyer lemon and yellow plum, this is a stunning example of a fresh crop Sidamo coffee.

 Why you'll love it: One of our more darkly roasted single-origin coffees, this natural-processed Brazilian has the sweetness and nuttiness of a chocolate-caramel candy bar.
 Story of the bean: In the 1940s, coffee consumption was beginning to soar and Brazilian coffee producers struggled to find a coffee tree that could withstand the strong winds and rain in the tropical savannas south of the Amazon. The solution was a hybrid plant called Catuai, a highly productive dwarf variety prized for its sweetness. With rich chocolate flavor and a full body, the Blue Diamond is a shining example of a Brazilian Catuai.

 One of the most popular single-cup brewing devices.
 It might look unconventional, but it makes a nice cup of coffee with relative ease and simple cleanup. Coffee fans around the world love the AeroPress and it is one of our favourite brewing methods. Interestingly, it's created by the same people who brought us the Aerobie frisbee. We like it because it's simple to make one cup at a time, produces great flavour articulation, and is relatively easy to clean. However, because it only makes one cup at a time, if you're entertaining you’ll need patient friends!

 This coffee was a magic carpet ride for us. Starting with the depth of Figs, zigging to the sweetness of a Mango, and zagging to the end with a splash of White Grape Juice. It's a whole new world. 
 Region: Rio NegroFarm: 5 VariousMunicipality: IquiraVarietal: Yellow BourbonAltitude: 1600-1750 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed 
 Yellow Bourbon is a natural cross between Red Bourbon and Amarelo de Botacuto, which is labelled as a Typica variant with yellow fruit. Bourbon resulted from selections made by French botanists in wild Yemeni coffee groves. Moved to controlled fields for propagation, the relatively humble stock produced a remarkable variety and was given the namesake of its nursery - Bourbon Island - upon its introduction to South American. Under expanded cultivation in Brazil, a yellow mutant with a unique flavor profile expressed itself and was isolated, expanded, and named for its color.
 This Variety Select lot comes to us courtesy of five small farmers from the villages surrounding the municipality of Iquira. With volcanic soil, anaverage temperature of 20-25° C, and 160 CM of annual rainfall, this area is extremely conducive to the cultivation of coffee. Generally, these farmers are processing only ripe cherries the same day of harvest using a dry fermentation of 18-24 hours. The coffees are then washed, and dried in parabolicos for an average duration of 12-18 days.

 Lots of love from Ethiopia. Muscovado Sugar and Jasmine start the journey and they fall into a bed of Apricots. We can't stop. 
 Region: Shakiso, OromiaFarm: Kayon Mountain Varietal: TypicaAltitude: 1900–2200 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed & Sun Dried
 The Kayon Mountain Coffee Farm is owned by multiple families that have been born and raised around the experience of coffee. These share-holding members had mainly been supplying coffee to auction for the past 30 years until they started their farm in 2012. This farm boasts a 500 hecatarespread, of which half is planted in heriloom Typica coffee and the other land reserved for cabbage, and indigenous shade trees. By 2015, they had implimented washing stations and dry-hullers allowing them to start exporting their own coffees and now see an annual production of about 300 tonnes. The coffees see an average fermentation time of 24-26 hours, followed by an average drying time of 12-20 days. As for the future, Kayon Mountain plans to plant more coffee, improve the quality of their processing, and even begin leasing more land to expand their practice.
 The ECX was started in 2008 to help protect farmers from market forces that might prevent them from making a living. Most of the coffee in Ethiopia is produced by small-holders who own 0.7 hectares, bumper crops often lead to big price drops, which can make it unprofitable for farmers to harvest their coffee. What the ECX does is commoditize grains- including sesame, beans, maize, wheat, and most importantly, coffee. This ensures prompt payment to farmers. It also integrates all parts of the “eco-system” involved in a grains market, including warehousing, grading, trading, and payment. Access to information is emphasized, as farmers can obtain information about trading prices and local delivery points easily through dedicated telephone lines.
 Here is a general rundown of how the ECX chain works in Ethiopia:
 While this system does ensure prompt payment and streamlines supply chain issues, it removes essentially all traceability from the coffee. This is problematic in the specialty world, where traceability is paramount.
 The ECX does not allow for complete traceability, but coffee cooperatives in Ethiopia do have the ability to go around the ECX and export the coffee themselves. Coffees that are exported by a cooperative can have traceability, possibly even to a single farmer.

  ”This is a coffee we’ve been buying Hunkute for a four years now, a fairly small cooperative in the Dalle region in Sidama. It seems to be one of the magic spots, where the micro region with fairly simple conditions keeps delivering stunning coffee year after year; a clear and juicy cup with a lot of apricot and white floral notes.” /Joanna Alm, Head roaster 
 Hunkute is made up of two washing stations (the imaginatively named Hunkute 1 and Hunkute 2) and is located in the region of Dalle in Sidamo. It is made up of 270 members. Hunkute 1 is located at 1850 masl and started 10 years ago, and Hunkute 2 at 2150 masl started around5 years ago, (both collecting from the members and taking in from surrounding farmers that wants to deliver ).
 All the co- operatives in Ethiopia belong to a Union, in this case the Sidamo Union, that sell and export the coffee. They also take care of dry milling and grading before export. Hunkute is superbly run aiming not only for quantity but also for quality in the cup
 Producer: Hunkute Site 1 and Hunkute Site 2 cooperative  Location: Dalle, Sidamo Ethiopia Varietal: Ethiopian Heirloom Varieties Harvest: December 2015Elevation:  1900-2000 maslProcessing: Fully washed Flavour description: Juicy and silky. Notes of mature apricot as in the white flower note, sweet chocolate bottom and rip yellow fruit.

            Form meets function in the peerless design of these tampers handcrafted for us by Reg Barber.
          
 Each tamper that leaves Reg Barber’s workshop in British Columbia, Canada is meticulously crafted by hand. While fresh beans and a quality grind are essential to preparing a delicious espresso, a righteous tool for tamping can make a world of difference in the quality of extraction. We use these tampers in both shops and are consistently impressed with how evenly the ground coffee is compressed in the espresso basket. Each one has been thoughtfully designed for comfort and repeated use and we couldn’t be more pleased with the result.

 It’s been many years since a coffee from Papua New Guinea has been on our menu, and it hasn’t been for lack of wanting. This lot from the Aiyura Valley in the Eastern Highlands is from a 34 Hectare washing station/ plantation owned by a gentleman named Sero Bebes - and what a fantastic job done by those who delivered to this station!
 Papua New Guinea is home to many Typica and Bourbon selections, including ones like Arusha, and Blue Mountain. This coffee is very versatile and we knew it would be a great addition to our espresso offerings.
 Here are the parameters that we've been using with Papua New Guinea Sero Bebes (parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket)
 A confirmation with instructions will be emailed to you.
 To celebrate all that we’ve come to love about coffee in twenty years of reverence, we’ve made a blend that combines the most exciting, downright mouthwatering flavors this noble tree has to give. In abundance. Citrus, berry, floral. Respect.

 Fresh coffee from some of the best coffee producers we know of, roasted to enhance the flavours of the different coffees character. We think that all coffee suits all brew methods. Coffee is roasted the same week as shipment. 
 Swiss Water Process involves first soaking the coffee in pure water. The green coffee extract that results is then passed through a carbon filter, specifically engineered to filter out the caffeine molecule. The green coffee extract is then introduced to the coffee but without the caffeine. This process is simple in theory, but impressive to execute, since the coffee has to be dried and preserved in an exacting way to ensure the inherent flavour of the coffee remains relatively unscathed.
 Great as both a filter, and an espresso, the cup profile is sweet, and subtle with flavours of cocoa, and caramel.
 Here are the parameters that we've been using with our latest Swiss Water Process (parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket)

 This natural processed lot from the Guji micro region of Ethiopia is remarkably clear yet complex. Processed by the Ethiopia Coffee Exporter Company owned by Grima Edima it brings together some of the best lots produced by the heirloom cultivars indigenous to the region. It features notes of raspberry and milk chocolate, with a citrus acidity in a coffee that makes a great espresso, drip, or french press option.

 Production process: Cherries are hand sorted for unripes and overripes before they go in to production. A Penagos Eco Pulper removes the skin and pulp. The coffee soaks over night, and are washed and graded in the washing channels in to three grades based on density. After washing it is being sorted and checked for defects while parchment still is wet, before being put on the drying tables. 
 Drying: Sun dried 10 – 15 days on African drying beds on hessian cloths. Coffees are covered in plastic during midday and at night, and in case of rain.
 
      “Every Stumptown employee is a steward of that single coffee cherry, from the time it gets picked until the time it ends up in your cup. Stumptown is an energy and a vibe and a culture, but it all ultimately revolves around amazing, incredible coffee.”

      
        —Skip Colombo, Partnerships & Sales
      

 We work hard. We make lots of jokes. We cheers beers, ride bikes together, go to shows and trade dogsitting favors. We have tremendous amounts of respect for each other and for what we do. Stumptown is a family on an elemental level. Many of us are artists, musicians, creative types, and passionate types. It helps our coffee taste better and it makes our work lives richer.
 And we drink the best office coffee on the planet.  
 Some of us came because we were regulars. The baristas knew our drinks and were having a whole helluva lot more fun than the jobs we had. Some came because of the coffee. Some of us were home roasters, or worked for other coffee companies across the country. Came for a chance to work with the best green coffee in the world.
 Some came because our best friends worked here. Most became best friends with our coworkers, because they also happened to be some of the best, most interesting people around.
 We all came because we wanted to be here. A grip of us have been here for over a decade. We’ve outgrown our first employee holiday dinners, squeezed in the backroom of a cozy Italian family restaurant in Southeast Portland. We’ve leapt across the country. Went Dutch for a summer. But our holiday parties still rage.
 We are passionate group of folks, some might even say obsessive. No matter which team we’re on, we’re sourcing, roasting, tasting, testing, practicing and pushing ourselves to do it better.
 
          We know we are the last link of a long chain, stretching across the earth, made up of hundreds of people and years of toil, soil and sweat to get this coffee into our hands. We take that responsibility very seriously. And we also have a lot of fun.
        
 Our Coffee Sourcing team travels to the ends of the earth to establish long term and sustainable relationships with incredible coffee producers. These folks work on the ground with producers so that the coffee quality can continue to improve year after year. Our Quality Control, Quality Assurance and Roasting teams take it from there, ensuring that the integrity of that amazing coffee shines through once it lands in our hands.
 Even though we have big love for the lo-fi days gone by, we’re lit up by the future in our digital realm. Our web team embodies Stumptown’s bright spirit of innovation and strives to offer the best and warmest online experience possible.
 By the time our coffee reaches the hopper or the Chemex, it has traveled far and wide and been through a long journey. Our adept coffee educators make sure we continue to best represent and elevate the experience of drinking Stumptown coffee in our cafes, and in the kitchens and cafes of our wholesale partners. Our service team of espresso techs is on-call 24-hours a day, in case a machine goes haywire at 8 am on a Saturday. 
 Our tight knit production crew takes pride in scooping, hand-carding, and folding every bag before we send it out into the world, whether it’s headed to a favorite cafe, restaurant, grocery store, or your doorstep.  Our Cold Brew production team brews, bottles and delivers everyone’s favorite pick-me-up. Look out for these guys on the road–they are hauling precious cargo. 
 Our cafes are our living rooms, where we strive to let our coffee shine to its full potential. Our baristas spend months learning how to pull the most pristine shot of Hair Bender espresso, and even longer taming the steam wand to master the art of pouring a perfect latte. We undergo continuous education and attend regular tastings, understanding the full spectrum of our coffee menu so we can help you pick out a coffee you’re going to love.  
 We count ourselves grateful that Stumptown is served in some of the best neighborhood cafes, restaurants and grocery stores across the country. Our partnerships are based on building customized coffee programs and solid relationships. We offer up much more than what’s in the cup. We’re only successful if our partners are, and our sales and support teams go above and beyond to make that happen.  
 We’ve got a team of talented folks who do much more than bean-counting. We rely on them for all the heavy lifting behind the scenes to keep the business running smoothly, and create efficient systems to support our day-to-day operations and growth. They are also the wi-fi wizards and keepers of the candy drawer, so they are super important in lots of ways. 
 Stumptown runs on creative energy (and coffee, obviously) and the Creative and Marketing team helps us wrangle it. Our in-house team is responsible for everything from illustrations on mugs and packaging design, to signage, communications, and throwing rad events with our friends and partners. If you ever see weird drawings, gifs, or photoshopped snaps of Ozzy Osbourne holding a Cold Brew stubby, that’s all them.
 
      “If it weren’t for the employees at Stumptown, there wouldn’t be a Stumptown. We understand hard work; that if something is going to be special, we’ve got to go outside the lines and outside the box.”

      
        —Duane Sorenson, Founder

 We should apologize. For years we’ve been saying, “Our decaf is way better than it needs to be.” But really, that’s not true. It needs to be this good.
 When you want to make a statement, sometimes you have to go above and beyond, or over the top, or whatever. Our statement? Decaffeinated coffee is coffee. And coffee should be great. The coffee industry in general, and even some of the fancy coffee world, simply doesn’t care about decaf. Which sucks.
 Think about it in terms of some other produce, like apples. First a harvest of fresh and tasty apples arrive at the grocery. Eventually, the bruised and distressed apples get discounted, and then maybe dropped in a free box for the employees. Those old and ugly apples left in the free box after being discounted and even offered for free… are better than most decaf.
 This coffee, on the other hand, is the fruit of four years of direction‐asking and aimless driving up 1,500 meter mountains on the El Salvador‐Honduras border region called Chalatenango (“Chalate”). That’s where we found Los Chelazos. We brought Los Chelazos here to SF to taste, then forwarded it along for reverse osmosis decaffeination by Swiss Water Process in British Columbia.
 Because it really needs to be this good. We’re sorry.

 We developed this espresso over five years ago for the launch of our Kiosk on Linden Street. This is probably our darkest espresso: lower-toned, minimal brightness, plenty of chocolate – with an engaging complexity as a straight shot. The shots are gorgeous: achingly heavy with voluptuous red-brown crema, and the silky, somewhat dangerous-looking viscosity of a power-steering stop-leak product once used on our (now departed) heroically battered 1983 Peugeot. In milk, it tastes like chocolate ovaltine, and holds its own from the daintiest 3oz Macchiato to our towering 12oz caffe latte. This is the most Brahmsian espresso we have. Brooding and autumnal, it is a coffee to mourn the passing of time.

 This lot actually combines three farms, all owned by members of the Lovo family. Each farm’s lot was washed in a separate beneficio, then immediately delivered to the La Estrella mill for drying on African‐style raised and shaded beds.
 First, there’s dad: Don Joaquin Augusto Lovo Lopez. He’s sort of the neighborhood’s go‐to elder for specialty coffee. He made sure that his sons were educated, but kept them working on the family farm evenings and weekends.
 Among the sons: David Ariel Lovo Gutierrez. David Ariel bought Finca La Pradera back in 1969, and‐‐except for the conflicts of the 1980s‐‐hasn’t left it since.
 Finally, his brother: Don Luis Joaquin Lovo. He’s basically the spokesman for the family, or at least the guy who sells us the coffee. Don Luis is actually a pretty quiet guy for a spokesman, come to think of it. What he is, is driven. He’s the one who pesters the Estrella mill‐workers and his export partners, frequently checking in on the coffee’s quality, always seeking feedback.
 It was a desire for feedback as much as anything that motivated Don Luis to hold back a few bags of his Maragogype crop for the Nicaraguan Cup of Excellence. What he got was an award. We’ll have a little of that for you this summer. But for now, step into this Caturra lot from the whole Lovo family.
 
	In honor of our hometown area code here in Grand Rapids, we dubbed this blend Six One Six. Six One Six is enjoyable, trustworthy, and balanced: designed to be a delicious coffee that everyone can savor and trust everyday, much like the city itself. Embracing our commitment to seasonal changes in coffee harvests, the coffees in Six One Six change throughout the year, lending subtle flavor differences that keep this blend interesting. 
 On New Year’s Day we woke up at Ryan the roaster’s house. Some people were getting antsy to wade through the rain to a café or bar or something, but Ryan the roaster wasn’t having it. “It’s nice and warm here,” he said.“Let’s all just take our shirts off, and relax.”
 That’s how we got the idea for this subscription. We want everyone to stay home, take their shirts off, and relax. We also ship to offices, where you can enjoy all the benefits of our subscription program except for the part about staying home, removing your shirt, and relaxing.
 No matter where you are, the “single origin” subscription gets you a different coffee from a single origin (like a certain farm in Guatemala or co-op in Ethiopia) each delivery. If you are getting more than one bag, each coffee will be different. We choose; you enjoy. The “espresso” subscription gets you Friendo Blendo unless you get more than one bag, in which case we throw in a single origin espresso with each delivery. We roast; you relax.

 Sightglass is proud to be roasting coffee from the Kageyo Coop Station for the third year in a row. Many of the members who deliver cherry to the station are also part owners and all share the responsibilities of running the station. Kageyo is situated a bit higher in elevation, nestled in the mountains of the Ngororero District, where this subtle change in elevation from farm to washing station yields a coffee with much more sweetness and complexity than its lower elevation neighbors.

			No one likes drinking bad coffee at events. Everyone likes meeting for coffee at one of our cafes. It isn’t rocket science: bring the Phil & Sebastian café experience to your next meeting or event and help raise the (espresso) bar!
		
 
Armed with a state of the art GS3 Espresso machine set to the exact specifications of our cafes, let the barista come to you to deliver the meticulously crafted and locally roasted flavour of Phil & Sebastian. Our simple and stylish café setup will thoughtfully enhance your event space and leave your guests feeling inspired, energized and ready to take on the next session or turn on the dance floor!
		
 Email josie@philsebastian.com with all of these details and we will get back to you within one business day and then we can get started planning!
 All we need from you is a 6ft table and access to power – 2 separate 15amp circuits covers all our equipment! Add a third 15amp circuit if your party is so happening that we are bringing two baristas.
 We will need access to your event space 60mins prior to the event start, no more no less!
 We will need access to the loading dock (or somewhere with a ramp) because while our mobile espresso machine is small, it is anything but light!
 Unfortunately, we are not setup to accept payment per coffee onsite. We will invoice you directly for the full amount.
 You know it! The only thing we ask is that a tent backup plan be setup in case the wild Calgary weather takes a turn for the worse during setup. Keep in mind we will still need access to power and a table.

 Kiumu landed stateside early this year thanks in part to the collaboration with our export partners in Kenya. Kiumu represents the next chapter in our mission to develop a quality-founded relationship coffee with a single estate producer in the region. Last year, this budding exploration brought us to Muranga County. During our travels we were fortunate to meet John Njoroge, who owns and personally manages Kiumu, a parcel of a 100 acre estate which he shares with his brothers. Parlor is in the nascent stage of an exclusive relationship with John: we purchased every one of John’s Kiumu lots this year because we believe in the potential of this coffee. John Njoroge’s Kiumu is ripe with flavors coveted in the finest Kenyan coffees: juicy stone fruits meld with citrus notes and make way for a remarkable flavor of fresh blackberry. We are excited for the evolution of this relationship coffee throughout this season and for seasons to come.
 Fresh coffee is roasted every Sunday, Monday and Wednesday and shipped the following day. Please place your order by 5:00 PM Eastern Time the evening before the respective roast day to ensure that it is included.

 San Sebastian represents one of our earliest projects in coffee sourcing. This producers group spans 400 smallholder farmers with plots in the micro region, based in the municipality of La Plata, within the department of Huila. San Sebastian is sourced seasonally throughout Colombia’s two harvests so as to offer the freshest possible crop at any given time. San Sebastian possesses heavy sugary notes and expresses fruited acidity. In the cup, we find brown sugar, dried fruits and a touch of baking spice.

 This amazing coffee from the Uraga co-op (belonging to the Oromia Cooperative Farmers Union) is grown at elevations between 1900-2200 m and consists of heirloom cultivars. The coffee is washed processed, carefully and slowly sun dried, and meticulously sorted to give us amazing uniformity. 
 This is absolutely one of our favorite coffees; it has a jammy lushness and taste notes of peach cobbler, honey, lots of florals. It is simultaneously crisp and refined and soft and juicy.
 We won a Good Food Award with a lot from last year's harvest and we're thrilled to see this coffee back on our menu for the third year in a row.

       Water Avenue Coffee.

 Thank you for accessing the wateravenuecoffee.com Website (“Site”) operated by Water Avenue Coffee. We respect your privacy and want to protect your personal information. To learn more, please read this Privacy Policy.
 This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and (under certain conditions) disclose your personal information. This Privacy Policy also explains the steps we have taken to secure your personal information. Finally, this Privacy Policy explains your options regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. By visiting the Site directly or through another site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and consent to the collection and use of information as discussed in this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not access this Site.
 This Privacy Policy applies to the Site. This Privacy Policy does not necessarily apply to any offline collection of your personal information. Please see below for details.
 We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices on any web site not operated by Water Avenue Coffee. to which the Site links or that links to the Site.
 We collect information from you in several different ways on this Site. We may collect any content, record, or electronic communication of any kind, including without limitation your (1) contact information, (2) financial information, (3) demographic information, and (4) other personal information required to process your application to request services from us, so that we may provide you with the information or services that you request, and so that we may communicate with you and send you information and materials for marketing and other purposes, subject to applicable laws and the terms of the Privacy Policy.
 One goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide an efficient, meaningful, and customized experience. For example, we can use your personal information to:
 (a) Registration and Ordering. Before using certain parts of any Site or ordering products, you must complete an online registration form. During registration, you will be prompted to provide to us certain personal information, including but not limited to your name, shipping and billing address(es), phone number(s), email address, and credit card number. These kinds of personal information are used for billing purposes, to fulfill your orders, to communicate with you about your order and the Sites, and for internal marketing purposes. If we encounter a problem when processing your order, your personal information may be used to contact you.
 (b) Email Addresses. Several locations of the Site permit you to enter your email address for purposes including but not limited to: to register for a contest or sweepstakes; to request us to notify you of new products; to sign up for email newsletters and special offers. Your participation in a contest or sweepstakes is completely voluntary, so you have a choice whether to participate and disclose information to us. We use this information to notify contest and sweepstakes winners and to award prizes. By entering a contest or sweepstakes, you may be opting in to receive our email newsletter and special offers and this will be disclosed in the official rules governing the contest or sweepstakes.
 (c) Cookies and Other Technology. Like many sites, the Site employs cookies and web beacons (also known as clear GIF technology or “action tags”) to speed your navigation of the Site, recognize you and your access privileges, and track your Site usage.
 (i) Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored as text files by your Internet browser on your computer’s hard drive. Most Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from web sites or to remove cookies from your hard drive, but if you do, you will not be able to access or use portions of the Site. We have to use cookies to enable you to select products, place them in an online shopping cart, and to purchase those products. If you do this, we keep a record of your browsing activity and purchase. THE SITE’S COOKIES DO NOT AND CANNOT INFILTRATE A USER’S HARD DRIVE TO GATHER A USER’S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Our cookies are not “spyware.”
 (ii) Web beacons assist in delivering cookies and help us determine whether a web page on the Site has been viewed and, if so, how many times. For example, any electronic image on the Site, such as an ad banner, can function as a web beacon.
 (iii) We may use third-party advertising companies to help tailor site content to users or to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and web beacons to measure advertising effectiveness (such as which web pages are visited or what products are purchased and in what amount). Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any personal information collected by us.
 (iv) As an example, Facebook collects certain information via cookies and web beacons to determine which web pages are visited or what products are purchased. Please note that any information collected by Facebook via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any customer's personal information collected by us.
 (d) Log Files. As is true of most web sites, the Site server automatically recognizes the Internet URL from which you access the Site. We may also log your Internet protocol (“IP”) address, Internet service provider, and date/time stamp for system administration, order verification, internal marketing, and system troubleshooting purposes. (An IP address may indicate the location of your computer on the Internet.)  IP addresses are not used to track a user’s session.  This information only helps us determine how often different areas of our Site are visited.  We do not link IP address to any information that is personally identifiable.
 (a) Internal Use. We use your personal information to process your order and provide you with customer service. We may internally use your personal information to improve the Sites’ content and layout, to improve outreach and for our own marketing efforts (including marketing our services and products to you), and to determine general marketplace information about visitors to the Site. In order to facilitate such use and the other use described in this Section 2, we may share your information with affiliates under Water Avenue Coffee’s control.
 (b) Communications with You: We will use your personal information to communicate with you about the Site and your orders and deliveries. Also, we may send you a confirmation email when you register with us. We may send you a service-related announcement on the rare occasions when it is necessary (for example, if we must temporarily suspend our service for maintenance.) Also, you may submit your email address for reasons such as to register for a contest or sweepstakes; to request us to notify you of products; to sign up for email newsletters and special offers. If you submit your email address, we use it to deliver the information to you. We always permit you to unsubscribe or opt out of future emails (see the opt out section, below, for more details). Because we have to communicate with you about orders that you choose to place, you cannot opt out of receiving emails related to your orders.
 (c) External Use. We want to provide you with excellent service and to offer you a great selection. We do not sell, rent, trade, license or otherwise disclose your specific personal information or financial information to anyone other than to affiliates under Water Avenue Coffee’s control, except that:
 (i) As do most Internet retailers, we sometimes use others to perform specific functions on our behalf. When we disclose information to these service providers, we disclose information to help them to perform their service. For example, in order to deliver products to you, we must share some information. We partner with third parties (such as the U.S. Postal Service and United Parcel Service to ship products, to ensure delivery, and so that we can obtain feedback, improve the quality of our service, and measure and improve the quality of the service of the third party. In the example of shippers, we provide them some personally identifiable information such as your name, shipping address, email, and phone number.
 (ii) Similarly, to help you buy products and provide customer service to you, we must provide your credit card number to financial-services corporations such as credit-card processors and issuers. When we submit your credit card number for authorization, we use state-of-the-art data encryption to protect your information. (More on this below in Data Security.)
 (iv) We may disclose such information in response to requests from law enforcement officials conducting investigations; subpoenas; a court order; or if we are otherwise required to disclose such information by law. We also will release personal information where disclosure is necessary to protect our legal rights, enforce our Terms of Service or other agreements, to operate the Site or to protect ourselves or others. For example, we may share information to reduce the risk of fraud or if someone uses or attempts to use the Site for illegal reasons or to commit fraud.
 (v) We will not sell (or trade or rent) personally identifiable information to other companies as part of our regular course of business. However, it’s possible that we might acquire or merge with or be acquired by another company or that we might dispose of some or all of our assets. If that happens, your personal information may be disclosed to another company, but that disclosure will be subject to the Privacy Policy then in effect.
 (vi) We may share non-personal information (such as the number of daily visitors to a particular web page, or the size of an order placed on a certain date) with third parties such as advertising partners. This information does not directly personally identify you or any user.
 (vii) We may publicly disclose the name, city, and state of the contest and sweepstakes winners.
 (viii) In addition, we may use and share aggregated information that does not uniquely identify you when it enables us to improve and enrich our services and the Site’s content.
 We maintain full rights to any information collected on this website, and may freely collect, use and disclose such information unless prohibited by this Privacy Policy or applicable law.
 The Site incorporates physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, including Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) for all financial transactions through the Site. We use SSL encryption to protect your personal information online, and we also take several steps to protect your personal information in our facilities. Access to your personal information is restricted. Only employees who need access to your personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to your personal information. Finally, we rely on third-party service providers for the physical security of some of our computer hardware. We believe that their security procedures are adequate. For example, when you visit the Site, you access servers that are kept in a secure physical environment, behind a locked cage and an electronic firewall.
 While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information, we cannot guarantee complete security. 100% complete security does not presently exist anywhere online or offline.
 Upon your request, we will (a) correct or update your personal information; (b) stop sending emails to your email address; and/or (c) disable your account to prevent any future purchases through that account. You can make these requests at the “contact us” section of the Site http://wateravenuecoffee.com/contact, or by telephoning, or emailing your request to Water Avenue Coffee’s Customer Service Team 1-503-808-7083 or:
 Please do not email your credit-card number or other sensitive information.
 If you wish to have access to your personal information in our records, please contact us with your request at info@wateravenuecoffee.com.  You may also request that we update your personal information or correct any factual errors that you believe may exist regarding this information.
 OFFLINE COLLECTION, USE & DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
 As you might expect from us, the majority of information that we collect is obtained through the Site, and this Privacy Policy applies only to that online collection of personal information. We also may collect information offline, where we also try to protect the privacy of your personal information. One example involves someone calling us to place an order or to ask questions. When someone calls, we will ask only for the personal information we need in order to place the order or to answer the question. When we need to store information (such as order information), we will enter it into our database through SSL encryption. (See the Data Security section above for more information). Another example involves faxes. If you fax something to us, we will act upon the fax and then either store it a locked repository or we will shred the fax if there is no need to retain the information. There are other ways we could learn of personal information offline (for example, we suppose someone could send us a letter including some return address information), and this Policy doesn’t discuss or try to predict all of those methods or uses. As we mentioned, we will try to treat offline collection, uses, and disclosures consistently with our relevant online practices.

 Strawberry Tart / Toblerone / Shirley Temple
 Within the well respected micro region of Pedegral lies a small village, Agua Blanca. Cousins Walter and Juvenal Penna are the shining producers of this “jewel in the crown” that is Agua Blanca. In the highest elevations of Agua Blanca both producers operate their own farms and washing stations maintaining the same standards as the other. Beyond their exceptional practices, one of the other secrets to their quality is the combined varietal makeup. Walter produces Typica and Yellow Bourbon while Juvenal grows exclusively Caturra – a combination rarely seen in Colombia. This is the second year we have worked with Walter & Juvenal and are proud to be able to offer their coffees once again. Never have we experienced a coffee carry such a similar flavor profile over two years. The cousin’s skilled farming practices and processing techniques come together to make a consistently amazing coffee that we love both brewed and served as a single origin espresso.
 Agua Blanca starts off with sweet fruit tones of ripe strawberry, orange and peach and an underlying menthol-like herbaliness that reminds us of wild wintergreen. Cooling, the cup richens into flavors of milk chocolate and toffee, similar to Toblerone bars. This coffee, just like last year, is full of candied fruit tones such as preserved cherries and orange, which combined with the sweeter wine finish, reminds us of the Minnesota classic - the brandy old fashion. It is the perfect coffee to toast the hard work and continued excellence of those around you.

			We’re a coffee roaster but to say we’re passionate about coffee is far too simple. For us, the all-consuming life of a coffee begins when we travel worldwide to collaborate with producers that go all out to produce a coffee beyond compare. We then work directly with them at ground level on projects to introduce modern technology and sustainable methods to improve their farms. But at the end of the day, we’re coffee nerds hell-bent on sourcing, roasting and serving the best coffee possible. So, passion? It doesn’t even begin to describe us. Below you can purchase fresh-roasted whole bean coffee for home.

 Our coffees are directly sourced from producers in many countries. With such a vast array of climates and altitudes, harvest and availability schedules differ depending on where the coffee was sourced from. Our Global Coffee Harvest Schedule is a rough guide to show you when a harvests generally occur in a country and what months we'll most likely have your favourite coffees available.
 We are currently working directly with coffee producers worldwide from Bolivia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Ethiopia and Kenya to improve the quality of our coffees from the very start of their journey. From the agriculture, processing, and drying stages to the transportation and roasting, we care deeply about producing the best coffee we can buy, and are constantly perfecting it so we can share these coffees with Canada and the world.

 At our Calgary, Canada coffee roasterie, we personally ensure our coffees are roasted carefully, leveraging experience and technology to improve consistency in every roast batch. As we roast, we strive to highlight the unique characteristics of each of the coffees we source. The result? What we hope is some of the most delicious coffee you can buy in Canada and maybe even the world.

 Browse our coffee online by the distinct regions they’re grown, or explore different taste profiles to find the best coffee for you. You can order any of our in-season coffees directly and we’ll have them delivered right to your door. If you’re looking for unroasted coffee, it is available via our green coffee subscription.

 The most common source of fuel used to supply a coffee roaster with heat is gas. We are, however, the first and only roaster in the United States to roast coffee beans exclusively over a fire fueled by Oak Wood. The differences are not what one might initially expect. Unlike cooking with a wood oven or grill, where the smoke from the wood imparts a flavor to the final product, the main difference between wood and conventional roasting lies in the quality of the heat delivered to the beans. Heat derived from wood has higher moisture content and is better suited for slow roasting.
 The more oil preserved within the bean, the more exquisite the final flavor will be. The natural humidity within the wood seems to envelop the beans during the roasting process, hence preserving more of the lipids within. Meanwhile, the slow roasting aspect ensures the coffee is lower in acidity and higher in body. The result is most apparent in our espresso, yielding more crema, fuller flavor, and a smoother finish. For drip coffee for which we actually wish to retain the acidity of the coffees, we subject the beans to a faster roasting time.
 The unique advantages of wood roasting do not come without challenges, as the use of such an inconsistent fuel (i.e. wood) creates difficulties in maintaining consistency between roasts. A nightmare for an inexperienced operator, years of experience of roasting with wood are required to develop the intuition and instinct necessary to master the process. Luckily for us, with 30 years of wood roasting under our belt, we are able to claim this as an advantage; since through the unpredictable nature of roasting with wood, we are required to be attentive and obsessive with each and every roast: nothing can replace the skilled guidance of our experienced roasters. However, never the ones to be overconfident, we still go through extra steps to ensure consistency and quality.
 We begin by selecting well seasoned wood from responsible suppliers. We then utilize thermocouple data collected at key locations on the roaster along with VFD motor control, which allows to make fan and drum speed adjustments during the roasting process. The wood smoke emissions are then abated by high powered afterburners which are in full compliance with local air quality standards. Combining these tools with our years of experience, we are able to maintain control of the roasting process with a very high level of consistency. As you can see, wood roasting is an artisan craft where human experience using old world methods, combined with the latest technological advances in roasting, delicately blend art and science. We hope you will enjoy a distinctive coffee experience which is impossible to duplicate.
 We ship freshly roasted coffee Monday - Friday. Get your order in by 12pm on weekdays, and have your coffee shipped the next day!

	Blending coffee is science and artistry working in perfect harmony. Each single origin carries a distinct flavor, but when infused together, creates a new drinking experience. When the right combination is achieved, the complex blend is better than the sum of its parts. 
	
	On that note, we're excited to introduce our newest blend. This three bean blend from Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda presents deep flavors of lemon blossom, grapefruit, lychee and blackberry mixed in a balanced cup "Out of Africa".

 Jam-like in both texture and its intense sweetness, Worka combines a dynamic florality with mulling spice and wild berry flavors.
 Sourced from among the 300 members of the Worka Cooperative, Worka owes its distinct complexity and clarity to not only meticulous processing featuring a Gaviota demucilager and channel-washing system; but the staggering altitudes and mystical terroir surrounding the Worka Kebele in Gedeb. It's needless to say, we're pretty head-over-heels for coffees hailing from this small but mighty community.
 Upon it's 2005 inception, Worka joined the twenty-six other member cooperatives affiliated with the Yirgacheffe Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union (YCFCU). Benefitting over 45,000 member smallholder farmers, The YCFCU is committed to supporting a sustainable coffee supply from cooperatives in the Gedeo ethnic region of Ethiopia.

 San Agustin coffees are characterized by dense fruit and intense sweetness. Bodied and structured, these coffees exhibit dried-fruit acidity and aromatics.
 There's something about San Agustin. Precipitous and deceptively difficult to access, Huila's southern-most municipality sits in the Eastern foothills of the "Macizo Colombiano" - a sort of hub where three spokes of the Andes connect. In other words… Mountains. Here, nestled in the Macizo Colombiano, lie the headwaters of the formidable Rio Magdalena - Colombia's largest and most important river. 
 In San Agustin, small-holder farmers average just a few hectares. Cherries they pick are de-pulped using manual, hand-cranked de-pulpers before soaking in small plastic or tiled tanks for 18-24 hours. Afterwards they're set to dry in typical parabolic driers (greenhouse-like, tarped enclosures that allow light to penetrate heat, but shield drying coffee from wind and rain). 
 Colombia La Magdalena celebrates three smallholder farmers - Alejandra Bravo, Segundo Urbano and Carlos Imbachi - who exemplify the potential of this lush micro-region.

 We are very happy to work with Daniela and Pedro Rodriguez in Bolivia. Bolivia a country struggling with both poverty and leafrust, this is means that farm volumes low and the makes paying the producers properly extremely important. Working together with Daniela and Pedro we are supporting their program Sol de Mañana which is educating the farmers in treatments   for leafrust and a higher price they can achieve for  higher quality. /Joanna Alm, Head roaster  
 In the small colony of Collasuyo in Caranavi region Nicolas Calque and his wife Maruja are doing a careful job at their process station. They have a farm called “ La Florida”  in Collasuyo of 12 hectares where they produce and process their coffee. Nicolas started in coffee industry 18 years ago. His neighbors recognize him as a coffee lover and at the age of 14 Nicolas went to live with grandmother  as his family were having economical problems. He started working as coffee picker, whilst his grandmother provided food and shelter.
 In 1999 Nicolas invested all his savings and bought a farm in the colony of Collasuyo where he dedicated his entire farm to produce coffee, but the prices they were receiving for their product were too low to cover the family costs. In 2010 Nicolas and his wife sold their farm and moved to Brazil to improve their quality of life. However, they soon changed their mind, ”It was not what I expected, I worked over 8 hour in a sewing plant, we lived with 20 families locked in a room in poor conditions.”  says Nicolas.
 Six months later Nicolas returned home to Collasuyo with his family and bought back the coffee farm in the farm from his savings. This has motivated Nicolas to produce more and tastier coffee. He’s a part of the program that Daniela and Pedro has, called Sol de Manana. Pedro and Daniela are exporting the coffee and finding a good market for it, they are also training the farmers to work for a higher quality with less leaf rust. This year Nicolas has planted two more hectares of coffee.
 Producer: Nicolas ColqueLocation: Collasuyo, Caranavi, Bolivia Varietal: Caturra, Catuaí and Typica Harvest: May to September 2015, peaking in June and JulyProcess Date: 19th July 2015Elevation:  1550-1650 maslProcessing: Full-washed and dried on chemical beds for 7-9 days. Our current espresso recipe: 18g / 29 sec / 36 g (a TDS about 9.5% which gives an extraction around 19%).  Flavour description: A very mature and sweet cup with a big body.

VARIETAL: Heirloom
FARM: Cheri Station
ALTITUDE: 1850-2000 M

ROAST: Medium
NOTES: Washed Process

 
	This bean offers a complex fusion of floral and dried fruit in aroma that transcends in the cup with sweet tones of berries, citrus-lime, and cocoa dusting along with a light and creamy finish.   
	
	This coffee is from the Guji Zone of the Cheri ward in the Hagermaryam district located within Sidamo. It lies within the greater Oromia region of Ethiopia and borders the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region (SNNPR). This is a privately owned organization that has roughly 700 contributing farmers using the mill at Cheri. 

 
REGION: Lintong
VARIETAL: Ateng, Jember and Garundang
FARM: Lintongnihuta (shors of Lake Toba)
ALTITUDE: 1000-1300 M
FARMER: Various
ROAST: Medium
NOTES: Wet-Hulled Process

 
This larger bean from Lake Toba brings out complex flavors of raisin, plum, cocoa, with hints of sweet herbs and fresh green peppers along with a full body, lively acidity and a sweet finish.
	
	The Sumatra Lintong Mutu Batak comes from selected producers surrounding the town of Lintongnihuta in the Provinsi Sumatera Utara (Northern Sumatra Province).  This specific area is located on the southern shores of Lake Toba, which is the largest volcanic lake in the world.  The soil around the southern part of the lake is volcanic which leads to exceptional terrain for growing coffee.  The town of Lintong Nihuta sites on a plateau that ranges from 1000 meters with a few farms around 1300 meters.  
	
	The producers of this coffee are small farmers who have been recognized by our staff to produce exceptional raw material.  These selected farmers run small two to four hectare plantations with each hectare consists of approximately 1,000 coffee trees. The farmer grows, harvests, and depulps the coffee on the farm.  After depulping he stores the coffee overnight, allowing it to ferment and washes the following day.  After washing the farmer will briefly dry the coffee to remove the moisture from the exterior of the parchment and delivers the coffee to our production facility.
	
	At this point the coffee is inspected to ensure that it surpasses our expectations.  If the coffees do not pass inspection, we will not purchase the shipment.  If the coffees meet our requirements, we will put into greenhouses for drying down to about 40% moisture.  At this point, the coffee will be hulled and then put back into the greenhouse for further drying.  
	
	After the coffee is dried to 12 to 13% moisture content in the greenhouses, the coffee will be delivered to the warehouse in Medan.  It is inspected and graded again upon arrival to ensure no errors were made during processing.  The coffee is then warehoused for 2 months.  Then it goes through the final grading, hand sorted, bagged and ready for export.

       Water Avenue Coffee.

 Complex tropical overtones and flavors of pineapple and melon with fresh papaya acidity—pungent but smooth and balanced. .
 This is a particularly spectacular tiny lot from Nodier Andrade. We’ve been buying a variety of coffee from him throughout the season, pulling out these exceptional day lots to feature. His farm, El Mandarino, is high up in the mountains of Huila at 1900 meters. The combination of favorable climate, great varieties like Typica and Caturra and his approach to farm renovation and care of processing make this Colombian coffee like none we’ve ever offered. Wild brightness and sweet tomato notes can make this coffee mistakable for a Kenya on the cupping table.
 For more on Nodier Andrade, check out our blog post from a few years back.

 Kiawamururu is a famous wet mill and co-op near the Mukurwe-ini town in Nyeri, Kenya. The mill screen sorts the AA, AB, and PB sizes, and this AA really impresses us. Juicy red apple acidity and sweetness, this is an exceptionally beautiful coffee.
 Our roast days are Monday and Wednesday. All coffee is roasted to order and ships one day after the day it was roasted.
 ﻿All of our coffee is now flushed with nitrogen when bagged, creating an inert atmosphere that improves freshness. An unopened bag of coffee can now retain freshness for 4+ weeks.

 Why You'll Love it: There are two types of people, those who have had a life-changing cup of Ethiopian coffee and those who haven't. This coffee has a proven power to open your mind to the flavor possibilities of coffee. So whether this coffee is a revelation or causes you to reminisce, you'll love this coffee.
 Story of the bean: The cross-pollination and continual evolution of heirloom varieties of Ethiopia create this wonderfully complex cup of coffee. After the ripest cherries have been harvested the coffee seeds remain within the fruit during the drying process endowing this coffee with a heavier body and an intense berry sweetness.
 In 1992 in Ethiopia's Great Rift Valley anthropologists discovered Ardipithecus Ramidus, a 4.4 million year old hominid fossil. This fossil represented a paradigm shift in the understanding of human evolution and inspired the name of this distinctive coffee that changed the way we think about naturally-processed Ethiopians. In an ever-evolving specialty coffee industry La Colombe is proud to offer this heirloom Ethiopian year after year.

 Leonardo Coffee is the exclusive choice of premium coffee outlets; a natural choice for those connoisseurs searching for a prestige coffee that offers a high-end taste difference as regards quality and individuality.
 Underpinned by a purist attitude, Leonardo Premium Coffee takes several characteristics from its namesake. Renowned painter, sculptor, engineer, and writer, Leonardo da Vinci, possessed a reputation for perfection. He was the original creative thinker, a philosopher as much an artist, who after contemplating a move in his work, would stop, look and contemplate some more.
 Roasting coffee, like art, represents the culmination of countless years of finessing, to achieve the perfect result, every time.
 Leonardo Coffee is a reflection of The Northbridge Coffee Roasters commitment, working with selected green beans to achieve the perfect blend while refining the entire coffee process. A fine sweetness is rounded with the slightly chocolate taste of this exceptional, aromatic premium coffee blend. It has a bronze colour and consistent, chestnut crema with medium acidity on the palate.
 Available exclusively in 1kg bags to selected markets.

 Lively spicy acidity upfront, caramel sweetness, nutty, earthy, full well rounded body, and bitter sweet finish.
 With the addition of milk, Leonardo Premium displays pronounced cocoa, caramel and malty flavours which cut through the milk well.

 Ever since we've been exposed to "Sugar Processed" Decafs, we've fallen in love. Ethanol is used to extract a solvent found in sugarcane, which extracts the caffeine. Definitely the gentlest non-chemical decaffeination, and to boot this is done in the same country as the coffee was produced, Colombia, also a rarity in decaffeination. Honestly, this just tastes like a really beautiful coffee from Colombia, it just happens to be Decaf.

 Four cooperatives near the towns of La Libertad and Todos Santos have partnered with Slow foods USA to form a Presidium dedicated to improving the lives of the coffee farmers and the quality of the coffee they produce. This organization supports farmers growing the traditional washed Bourbon, Caturra, Typica and Pache type plants that MAKE UP this lot. The cup features notes of orange zest, caramel, and nuts for a great morning brew.

 The Kiruga mill is a great u-turn success story. What we mean by this is that many considered it the lowest performing factory in the Othaya co-op just last year! However, this season, with the diligent work of factory manager Anthony Gatheru Gachuka and some highly beneficial input from agronomists with Kenya Coffee Cooperative Exporters, their quality might just be the best of any factory in Othaya now.
 Phil visited the Othaya mill for the first time this season, and left very impressed. It’s an atypically sophisticated operation, complete with a cupping lab and a dry mill. The members of the board of directors were warm and welcoming and invited Phil to cup for many hours at their lab. It was there that he found this extraordinary lot. Phil was on the lookout for great coffees from Kiruga, but this coffee really exceeded all expectations. Exotic, clean and transparent it was one of his highest scoring coffees of the trip! 
 The most fantastic element of the cupping experience at Othaya was that the grinder was malfunctioning, and the coffee for the cuppings was incredibly coarsely ground. All the coffees tasted were most certainly under-extracted, but nevertheless utterly delicious. During his visit Phil found about 10 lots that were truly stellar, then pared them down based on moisture content, water activity and a thorough visual inspection of the green. In the end, we bought all of these coffees and this season all of our Kenyans are from Othaya! 
 Their cupping lab is under the direction of David Wairagu, who also runs the dry milling operation. It’s clear that David cares deeply about the quality of the coffee and it shows in the cup. Unfortunately, the power was out all afternoon during his visit, so Phil couldn’t see their new dry mill in operation, but their newly installed Cimbria huller was surely an improvement from the old style impact huller, which would have overheated the coffee. 
 Every processing step must be carefully and meticulously managed; however, the key improvement at Kiruga (over last year) was the sorting of their wet parchment. For those that haven’t seen it before, the wet, clean parchment (after fermentation and soaking) is quite translucent. What this means is that one can see directly though it to determine the color of the interior seed. The shade of the seed color can then be used to determine its level of ripeness. If the strongly green-hued seeds are then sorted out, the cup quality is vastly improved, as these are under-ripes. Under-ripes will introduce less sweetness, green flavors as well as an astringent mouthfeel. This was the single most important change made at Kirgua, and it underscores the usefulness of this sorting! We look forward to continuing our relationship with Kirgua and Othaya for many years to come!

 Most coffee beers tend to be heavy, dark, and highlight roast or chocolate tones.  Java The Hop is a clean and complex coffee IPA made with single origin hops and single origin coffee.  As a company that prides ourselves so much on the quality of our single origin coffees, it is great to work with folks that take the same level of pride in their beer.  We love that this beer presents an opportunity to taste the origin - something that we strive to do day in, day out with our coffees.
 From Kiambu East District, Kenya, the Gichuna coffee beans grow on a family farm that has been passed down for multiple generations. They wet mill, ferment, and wash on site, then dry the beans on raised beds. Expect hints of caramel, molasses, and carob mixed with notes of ruhbarb, hibiscus, and currant.
 First bred by Yakima Chief Ranches, Simcoes are a unique American hybrid with a strong Northwest flavor. Aromas of passion fruit, apricot, and intense pine and woodsy aroma add to the fresh, youthful vigor of this complex hop.

 The Retana farm is located in Valle de Panchoy at around 1500 m.a.s.l, just outside the historic city of Antigua Guatemala. Retana has been own by the Cofiño family since 1932. Social and environmental responsibility is is important to the Cofiño’s, who currently emply and house 20 families - offering electricity and water facilities in addition to an allocated plit of land each to grow food crops and a school for the children.
 In the afternoon, the pickers deliver cherry to the mill, where red and yellow cherry is processed separately. Some of the nicest pre-sorting we’ve seen happens at Retana to make sure only ripe cherry is being processed - resulting in a consistent and clean cup. After the removal of skin and mucilage, the coffee is washed and sun dried on cement patios.
 Here are the parameters that we've been using with Guatemala Retana (parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket)

 A Costa Rican gem of a coffee. We are proud to have been able to pull out all the Plum sweetness and deep flavors of Honeydew dancing around the soft aromas of Rose.
 Region: Santa Cruz de LeonProducers: Ronny Hernandez Padilla and Ana Vita Padilla SolisFarm: Finca El RafelilloVarietal: Caturra // Catuai Altitude: 1750-1800 MASL Processing Method: Fully washed
 THIS COFFEE WAS SOURCED WITH CAFE IMPORTS
 This microlot comes to us courtesy of producers Ronny Hernández Padilla and Ana Vita Padilla Solís. They own and manage Finca El Rafelillo, a 5.5 hectare farm in the Leòn Cortez district of Tarrruzú, Costa Rica. This is a washed lot from the December-February harvest of 2015/2016.
 Café Imports bought its first Costa Rica microlot container at the end of the 2006/2007 harvest; at that time, microlot offerings were basically nonexistent. In six years, the Costa Rican microlot market has grown, and now Costa Rica is one of the most popular origins, delivering very consistent quality year after year.
 The Costas Café Imports is carrying are all sourced directly from micromills, and producers were paid at the farm-gate level. We managed local transportation, dry-milling, consolidation, and exportation of the coffees. This experience is extremely valuable, as it gives us a better understanding of what it takes to get coffee from cherry to export quality in GrainPro and jute with its corresponding marks.
 Rio Jorco’s owners are third-generation in the business. They are extremely focused on quality and conservation of nature. Los Lobos won Cup of Excellence #3 in 2012, and the owners have dedicated 3/4ths of the land to a private reserve. Rio Jorco is equipped with a complete wet- and dry-mill operation, which allows quality control throughout the process. They process coffee from their own farm, Los Lobos, but also purchase cherry from producers from the area. Producers are compensated based on cup quality, and get recognition for selling a microlot.
 Rio Jorco’s operations area is in the municipalities of Aserri, Acosta, Leon Cortez, Frailes, Desamparados, and Corralillo. These microregions of Tarrazu have won multiple Cup of Excellence awards, year after year.
 Café Imports is excited to bring you, once again, high-quality and traceable microlots from Costa Rica.

 Beautiful as espresso, drip or anything in between, this is our signature organic blend.
 A bright burst of citrus pairs beautifully with creamy notes of caramel and hazelnut.

 From all over the world, the beans come to us. A cup of Holler Mountain combines chocolatey Latin American textures with the brightness of fine east African beans. It’s an incredible versatile blend.
 Although the coffee comes from all over, each of our producers has something in common: the cherry are picked at the height of ripeness and carefully processed. Clear flavors of blackberry, citrus and toffee shine through in a creamy, full body.
 We ship freshly roasted coffee Monday - Friday. Get your order in by 12pm on weekdays, and have your coffee shipped the next day!

 This coffee was a magic carpet ride for us. Starting with the depth of Figs, zigging to the sweetness of a Mango, and zagging to the end with a splash of White Grape Juice. It's a whole new world. 
 Region: Rio NegroFarm: 5 VariousMunicipality: IquiraVarietal: Yellow BourbonAltitude: 1600-1750 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed 
 Yellow Bourbon is a natural cross between Red Bourbon and Amarelo de Botacuto, which is labelled as a Typica variant with yellow fruit. Bourbon resulted from selections made by French botanists in wild Yemeni coffee groves. Moved to controlled fields for propagation, the relatively humble stock produced a remarkable variety and was given the namesake of its nursery - Bourbon Island - upon its introduction to South American. Under expanded cultivation in Brazil, a yellow mutant with a unique flavor profile expressed itself and was isolated, expanded, and named for its color.
 This Variety Select lot comes to us courtesy of five small farmers from the villages surrounding the municipality of Iquira. With volcanic soil, anaverage temperature of 20-25° C, and 160 CM of annual rainfall, this area is extremely conducive to the cultivation of coffee. Generally, these farmers are processing only ripe cherries the same day of harvest using a dry fermentation of 18-24 hours. The coffees are then washed, and dried in parabolicos for an average duration of 12-18 days.

 THIS COFFEE WAS SOURCED BY CAFE IMPORTS
 This process is known as E.A. Sugarcane. It starts by fermenting molasses to create ethanol and combining it with acetic acid–found in vinegar–to make ethyl acetate. This is added to water, and applied to the green coffee to dissolve the caffeine completely out of the beans. The caffeine is separated from the greens and is steamed and washed with more water.
 This is truly an exceptional cup of coffee with flavors of citrus, caramel, and honey.

 Region: Shakiso, OromiaFarm: Kayon Mountain Varietal: TypicaAltitude: 1900–2200 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed & Sun Dried
 The Kayon Mountain Coffee Farm is owned by multiple families that have been born and raised around the experience of coffee. These share-holding members had mainly been supplying coffee to auction for the past 30 years until they started their farm in 2012. This farm boasts a 500 hecatarespread, of which half is planted in heriloom Typica coffee and the other land reserved for cabbage, and indigenous shade trees. By 2015, they had implimented washing stations and dry-hullers allowing them to start exporting their own coffees and now see an annual production of about 300 tonnes. The coffees see an average fermentation time of 24-26 hours, followed by an average drying time of 12-20 days. As for the future, Kayon Mountain plans to plant more coffee, improve the quality of their processing, and even begin leasing more land to expand their practice.
 The ECX was started in 2008 to help protect farmers from market forces that might prevent them from making a living. Most of the coffee in Ethiopia is produced by small-holders who own 0.7 hectares, bumper crops often lead to big price drops, which can make it unprofitable for farmers to harvest their coffee. What the ECX does is commoditize grains- including sesame, beans, maize, wheat, and most importantly, coffee. This ensures prompt payment to farmers. It also integrates all parts of the “eco-system” involved in a grains market, including warehousing, grading, trading, and payment. Access to information is emphasized, as farmers can obtain information about trading prices and local delivery points easily through dedicated telephone lines.
 Here is a general rundown of how the ECX chain works in Ethiopia:
 While this system does ensure prompt payment and streamlines supply chain issues, it removes essentially all traceability from the coffee. This is problematic in the specialty world, where traceability is paramount.
 The ECX does not allow for complete traceability, but coffee cooperatives in Ethiopia do have the ability to go around the ECX and export the coffee themselves. Coffees that are exported by a cooperative can have traceability, possibly even to a single farmer.

			We really love Costa Rica: the people, the landscape, and, most importantly, the coffee. Our love affair with sourcing from this country began in 2010, and in that time we’ve been lucky to partner with many great producers and mills. What’s most exciting about Costa Rican coffee is the producers have the education, means and incentive to invest in their farm and turn their coffees from great to truly exceptional.
		
 Espresso: Felipe Rodriguez // Costa Rica
 Filter: Gillio Francesa // Costa Rica
 Filter: Miguel Rojas // Costa Rica
 On our first visit to Costa Rica we established a friendship and partnership with Juan Ramon Alvarado and Francisco Mena, the owners of Exclusive Coffee, at the time, a start-up boutique exporter. Through this partnership, we have established some amazing relationships and forged some meaningful friendships with producers.
 In 2010, we began working with Ricardo Perez and Marvin Rodrigues, owners of a mill called Helsar de Zarcero. This partnership has flourished as we have invested in working with several of the mill’s best producers and have devel-oped long-standing relationships with them. Over the past five years, we have expanded our scope to include some great relationships with producers across the country from the West Valley to Tarrazu.
 Most notably, we have worked on two projects with Helsar: one to improve the drying of the coffee and help improve shelf life and another initiative to help farmers pick better coffee cherry. We have seen success with both of these initiatives but, while picking culture has proven hard to change, our drying projects have proliferated and have now been implemented with all of our partners.
 The drying projects involve significant commitment from each producer. The infrastructure is not simple, the logistics are detailed and the amount of time required is onerous. We work closely with each producer to ensure that this process goes smoothly and we visit their farms two or three times a year to help them make any necessary tweaks. We have seen great results from these projects and have seen significant improvements in how long they last without losing vibrancy. We communicate throughout the year and provide feedback to the producers, always thinking about projects for the upcoming harvest.

 333 years ago, the famed Viennese coffee house Zur blauen Flasche (or, The Blue Bottle) transformed the public into loyal patrons with their Yemeni coffee.
 Centuries later, Mokhtar Alkhanshali, two suitcases of coffee in hand, fled war-torn Yemen through the very port that first supplied Vienna and the world with coffee, heralding the beginning of Yemen’s modern coffee revival.
 Now, in collaboration with Port of Mokha, we’re sharing this venerable drink—from its oldest source—with you.

 “The invigorating wine that raises you to a state of ecstasy.”
 - Translation of Qahwah, the Arabic word from which “coffee” derives

 “It’s a miracle that this coffee is here.”
 - Mokhtar Alkhanshali, Port of Mokha Founder

 A special note from our roasting team: Due to the limited quantities available and the extra care required, we will roast and ship this coffee on Monday mornings.
After tasting a Yirgacheffe coffee at our Mint Plaza cafe, Mokhtar Alkhanshali (Ahl-kahn-sha-lee) began a journey that led him to found Port of Mokha, a Yemeni coffee interventionist project. Known as the site of the first commercially cultivated coffees, Yemen was once home to the world’s most celebrated coffee (the original 17th-century Blue Bottle in Vienna probably offered Yemeni coffee), and Mokhtar’s mission was to help farmers in Yemen restore that famous quality to its coffee trade. Along the way, he faced kidnapping and the outbreak of violent civil war, narrowly escaping to bring this coffee to a table where a modern-day Blue Bottle and a revitalized Yemeni coffee were reunited once again.
 The landscape where Hussein al-Haba’s coffee is grown is so extreme, it’s nerve-wracking. Suspended high on the deserted, rocky, sun-scorched slopes of Yemen’s Hayma region, this coffee grows in what seems like impossible conditions. But then, Hussein al-Haba is not one to shy away from a struggle. Father of three daughters and two sons and provider for his extended family of 25, Hussein has been farming coffee since he was a child, and his 490 coffee trees are a testament to his brilliant resilience.

 Due to the inherent inconsistencies of volumetric measurement, using a digital gram scale to measure your dose of coffee and water is ideal. The Bonavita Digital Scale is designed to deliver consistently precise measurements in 0.1 gram increments. Paired with a built in timer, this scale is the perfect tool to ensure a proper brew ratio at home.Dimensions:

 The latest iteration of Streetlevel Espresso is filled with the amazing roundness of a perfect cherry cordial as notes of caramelized fruit meld seamlessly with a touch of fresh zested orange.
 Colombia boasts one of the most diverse landscapes for coffee production in the world. With regions that house a multitude of unique growing climates within a hundred square kilometers, the diversity of flavor profile is enormous.
 The Andes Mountain range cuts towards the Pacific Ocean shortly after it starts in the northern parts of Colombia. After passing Medellin, it starts to run through some of the most formidable areas for growing coffee in the world. Cauca, a plateau laden region with hundreds of small counties has the terrain to house thousands of farms in close proximity. Further south, Nariño is remote and filled with intense peaks surrounding its inhabitants. Producing coffee in Nariño is difficult for both its remoteness, and also for the intensely steep landscape. Both regions are known for dark berry flavors in the cup, like blackberry.
 The latest version of Streetlevel has coffees from both of these regions. These coffees are made up of lots from a handful of smallholder producers. Their farms range from one hectare in size to four. They process their coffees using motor driven de-pulpers and utilize waterless fermentation before drying on raised beds in greenhouses.
 Streetlevel Espresso works perfectly as your everyday espresso or as a brewed coffee. This version we have been liking pulled fast and medium in output.

 Tart, deep red and high in vitamin C. Good hot and cold – a true all-day sipper. Caffeine free.
 Ingredients: Hibiscus flowers, Indian sarsaparilla root, ginger root, natural flavors, rose petals, elderflowers and lemon myrtle.

 The Cabernet of Hibiscus teas. Hibiscus flower, or jamaica, as it is known in Central America, is cultivated specifically as an herb for tea in China, Thailand and the Sudan, where it is smuggled into Egypt and sold as Egyptian Hibiscus.
 Why You'll Love It: This refined Colombian coffee displays rarely-tasted flavors of hibiscus and caramel-dipped apples.Story of The Bean: This coffee is the pride of Asociacion de Productores Agricolas de San Roque, a group of coffee producers that has set up an education system with a trained agronomist. Farmers receive classes on best growing practices, including planting the native Chachafruta tree which, in addition to having beautiful flowers, also fixes nitrogen in the soil and reduces the need for fertilizers. The Asociacion also works with a quality control analyst who tastes every delivery of coffee and grades it, then pays out price incentives for higher quality beans. Grown on steep hills in nutrient-rich volcanic soil, this extremely limited lot represents only the very best-tasting coffees from the San Roque producers.

 Devoted to pulling the simple from the complex.

 Heavy peony and rose flower aroma with flavors of mulberry jam, yellow tomato with that classic Kenya brightness.
 Kenyan coffees are known for their striking vibrancy and great complexity—pretty good option for the beginning of summer. Right? Right. This coffee is from one of the washing stations of the Rutuma Farmer’s Cooperative Society, which has about four thousand members in central Kenya. This coffee is also a peaberry, which means instead of two seeds forming inside the coffee cherry, only one grows and the thought is that there is more energy going to just one seed—upping the cup quality. Coffees in Kenya are graded by size, which can be parallel to cup quality but not all the time. We blind cup several coffees before deciding on tasty lots that work for us

 It's difficult to source high scoring coffee out of Brasil which is why we are proud to offer this coffee from Jose Oliveria.  It's our first year bringing this coffee in but we are confident that it's the beginning of a long term relationship.  The Cerrado Minerio Region is one of few producing high scoring lots and is the only area in Brasil with a "Protected Geographical Indication".

 This past February, we made our yearly trip to Ethiopia with Aleco Chigounis of Red Fox Coffee Merchants. These annual visits are always exciting, as Ethiopia is our favorite coffee producing country, and the coffees grown there are always dynamic and delicious. Among many of the cupping destinations on the trip, one of the best was the Oromia Cooperative Union, about an hour outside of base in Addis. Here, we cupped some of the most vibrant coffees the country had to offer, and found many additions to our upcoming lineup.

 The 1950 Blend's flavor profile harkens back to the days of old when spice traders collided with new lands and coffee shipped on boats made of timbers, flying canvas sails. In the cup, floral jasmine, lemongrass and a dense sweetness emerge balanced with a complex and spiced, weighty body. Applying a bit more roast on the blend than we generally approach our single origin coffees with, this blend will stand up to milk with the best of them and makes an exotic shot of espresso.
 Creating a blend to achieve a particular flavor profile can be very exciting. It allows us to cup samples from all over, with the goal of finding the perfect coffee, or coffees, to suit our needs. In doing so for The 1950 Blend, we seek heirloom, varietal coffees from the birthplace of coffee: Ethiopia. These coffees are some of the most nuanced, and complex coffees on the planet and can shape-shift from region to region, processing, and through roast application.

 Why You’ll Love It: This balanced coffee has a toasted coconut sweetness that stands out among other Brazilians.Story of The Bean: This coffee is called the Mahogany lot because it grows on the Fazenda Matilde farm under a canopy of beautiful Mahogany trees. The coffee and Mahogany are inter-cropped to provide shade for the coffee, bird habitats and erosion control. The trees are also a source of income for the farm, as Mahogany trees can be sold for wood after 20 years of growth. Our roaster visited the hillsides on this farm where this coffee is hand-picked, a rarity in Brazilian production. During tastings on the farm, he hand-selected this lot and we are excited to carry this unique Brazilian coffee for years to come.

 Finca Hartmann is the model of sustainability. The diversity of flora and fauna is truly impressive. The Hartmann family consists of the parents, who are retired but live on the farm, and their five adult children: 4 brothers and 1 sister. When it was time to divide up the farm, their father gave them a choice of splitting up the land and dividing it amongst them or sharing their land and dividing the labour. They chose the latter and have never looked back.
 The Hartmann siblings work as a close-knit team. Ratibor is in charge of R&D, quality assurance, roasting, and sales. He is also a certified Q Grader. Allan is in charge of processing, manages the beneficio (wet and dry mills), and is also a carpenter. Alexander is in charge of the farm management, picking schedules, and ensuring coffee tree and vegetation health. Kelly is the mechanic, and works on the many numerous machines that run the mill. Lastly, Alice, the lone sister, is in charge of administration, accounting, and running the various bird watching and nature tours that go through their farm. Naturally, the families of each sibling also contribute and together they form the Hartmann “clan”, as they are affectionately known.
 Over the past five years Sebastian has made many visits to the Hartmann family farm. During these visits, he has worked with the Hartmanns on improving many aspects of their business and production. The dedication the Hartmanns exhibit to the quality of product is admirable, and makes for a wonderful partnership.
 In 2013, the family improved drying procedures by increasing their quantity of drying beds, which allowed the coffee to dry slowly, and to the correct endpoint. In 2014, the Hartmanns worked to better their selection of ripe cherry. In 2015 they raised the bar with the storage of some of their parchment in climate control and in 2016 they improved their dry-milling techniques, resulting in coffee that is cleaner and has even better shelf life. The cleanliness is particularly evident in the Natural coffee – something that is difficult to achieve with this type of process. To accent just how delicious the Natural is this year, we are blending this coffee 50/50 Washed/Natural, whereas other years we have done closer to a 75/25 blend.
 Sebastian and Ratibor had a great visit this past February, during which they discussed some improvements that will be happening at the Hartmann farms for 2017, but also visited Ratibor’s new farm, which will begin to produce next year. This is exciting because it will be the highest elevation farm for the family and will produce a number of exotic and exciting coffee varieties.

 The AAK Brothers coop is a collaboration of three different coops in the Eastern and Western highlands of Papua New Guinea: Apo from the East, then Angra and Kange from the West. Each of these names means “brother” in their respective local languages. By joining forces, these three coops are not only making coffee production and processing easier, they have created a very unique flavor profile, bringing foundation and body from the West and the lighter top end from the East. Recently, the AAK Coop has been able to set up three washing stations in key areas for members to use, and has grown their arsenal of 80+ small stations that offer technical assistance and agricultural education for members to continually cultivate better harvesting practices. All of these aspects combined make for an expressively transparent and unique cup that is unmatched in the vast majority of Indonesia.

 Kiawamururu is a famous wet mill and co-op near the Mukurwe-ini town in Nyeri, Kenya. The mill screen sorts the AA, AB, and PB sizes, and this AA really impresses us. Juicy red apple acidity and sweetness, this is an exceptionally beautiful coffee.
 Our roast days are Monday and Wednesday. All coffee is roasted to order and ships one day after the day it was roasted.
 ﻿All of our coffee is now flushed with nitrogen when bagged, creating an inert atmosphere that improves freshness. An unopened bag of coffee can now retain freshness for 4+ weeks.

			With each blend, we hope to achieve that unattainable quality, that little something extra that otherwise cannot be found in a coffee.
			
 Cupping notes : Ample-bodied, Forest floor, Licorice
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Breakfast Blend combines distinctly spicy and mildly pungent characteristics of Indo-Pacific coffees. The result is an eye opening blend that is bold yet well rounded, and profound flavors that are sure to illuminate your mornings.
 Cupping notes : Complex, Dynamic, Blueberry
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Elysian refers to a state of bliss or happiness, simply put – heavenly. The Elysian Blend can be characterized as a very rich, full bodied blend with a lot of depth and complexity in flavor. This makes it a good after dinner coffee to enjoy with dessert.
 Cupping notes : Deep Smokiness, Browned Butter, Caramel
Roast level : DARK
 We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as baker’s chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.
 Cupping notes : Smooth smoke, Caramelized sugar, Silky body
Roast level : DARK
 This is our darkest Fair Trade/Organic certified blend. We thoughtfully selected the coffees that make up this blend in order to maintain some of their individual aroma and flavor attributes while standing up to the intensity of the unique way that we roast them. The result is a dark roasted coffee with sweetly smoky flavor, light body and just a glimmer of lemony citrus notes; a perfect way to ease into your morning and a great complement to an evening meal.
 Cupping notes : Chocolate, Caramel, Butterscotch
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Whether approaching by sea or from within the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Strait imbues a sense of magic and wonder. The stunning landscapes and picture perfect sunsets inspired us here at Mr. Espresso to create a blend that attempts to capture its grace and majesty. Dark chocolate, sweet caramel and fruit toned acidity seamlessly blend together to create our homage to this wonder of nature.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 There are seven bridges that keep the people of the Bay Area connected, and the Seven Bridges Blend pays homage to the diversity of people and tastes in the San Francisco Bay Area.
 A blend of Fair Trade and organic certified coffees, the Seven Bridges Blend is a velvety bodied blend with depth and a complex, multilayer flavor dynamic. A favorite among customers and chefs alike, this blend can be found at some of the finest dining establishments around the San Francisco Bay Area.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Silky, Subtle fruit tones
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Countless cafés along the Viennese streets have loaned out their tables to some of the finest thinkers of our time and some of the greatest works of art, politics and philosophy found their inspiration accompanied by a rich cup of coffee. Here at Mr. Espresso we took inspiration from this legacy of creativity when we came up with our Viennese Blend. A combination of our finest dark and light roasted Latin American coffees come together to create a rich, smoky cup with low toned fruit notes and a silky mouth feel.
 Cupping notes : Sweet Chocolate, Vanilla, Cherry
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Named after the restaurant that Carlo’s brother Franco Di Ruocco owned, Ristorante Villanova (Oakland circa 1980) – and the house blend that was served there. Its mild intensity embodies the essential characteristics of a classic American roast, yet reflects our passion for traditional, wood fired roasting. The Villanova House Blend is sweet enough to serve as a dessert coffee and mild enough to enjoy throughout the day.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Smoky, Low-toned acidity
Roast level : DARK
 The choice to use water processed decaf coffees for our Decaffeinated French Roast was necessitated by our desire to deliver our customers a delicious dark roast without caffeine or compromise. A silky mouthfeel and low-toned acidity enables the rich smoky flavor to linger without interruption through the long, resonant finish.
 Cupping notes : Smooth, Well balanced, Medium body
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 This is a blend of water processed decaffeinated Latin American coffees combining to make a smooth, full flavored coffee with medium body and well balanced acidity.
 Cupping notes : Caramelized sugar, Fruit notes, Silky mouth feel
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 This is a blend of African and Indonesian beans decaffeinated by a water process developed in Switzerland, which is considered the most natural method of decaffeinating coffee. Decaffeinated Elysian Blend is a hearty and full flavored blend, which is most unusual of water processed coffees.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Modeled after our Organic Seven Bridges Blend, this coffee has all the positive characteristics of the Organic Seven Bridges Blend without the caffeine. A good alternative for after dinner enjoyment or simply for those who are caffeine sensitive. The coffee is 99.9% caffeine free.

 The first coffee that got us hooked on speciality coffee was a Yirgacheffe natural, roasted and cupped with Stephen Diedrich at his factory in Sandpoint, Idaho.  From the first intense notes of all things not coffee (berries, flowers, juice, etc.) it was clear that coffee for us would become a lifelong passion. Since then, we have moved away from Naturally processed coffees from Ethiopia, often finding them too perfume like or pungent.  This year, while cupping this lot of Idido, we were blown away with its cleanliness and complexity and it instantly reminded us of why we got into the coffee business to begin with.

 I remember the coffee from Blanca Rojas as our most elegant coffee from Colombia last year.  Cupping the coffee this year with our green coffee source for Colombia, it was tasting like sparking raspberry soda with some milk chocolate notes.

 3 bags once a month, or 1 bag every 2 weeks, you choose how much coffee and how often. We'll send out coffees that we think are the best right now. Coffees will ship fresh and are roasted to order. On top of that, all of our coffees are nitrogen flushed and vacuum sealed to ensure that once you receive your coffee, it stays fresh. Simple as that. 
 Rather than paying a large upfront cost - you are billed with each shipment. This allows you to make changes to your subscription as you please!
 Each week, our roasting team will decide what coffee they are most excited about. Sometimes there will be coffees that only our subscribers will get to receive. This is a curated, coffee program that you can increase, or decrease the frequency and/or the quantity of coffee you receive. You can put the subscription on pause if you are going on vacation, or cancel if you need to. You are in complete control, and you'll never be without coffee in the house.

 This highly anticipated follow up book to his Barista and Filter books touches on almost all aspects of coffee roasting and presents Scott's ideas he has formed from years of practical experience.
 As a roaster and a consultant over the past nineteen years, Scott Rao has had the opportunity to cup and view the roast data for each of more than 20,000 batches roasted on a variety of machines by various methods. About five years ago, he spent several days poring over reams of roast data in an attempt to find the common elements in the best batches I’d ever tasted.* To be clear, I’m not refer-ring to “really good” batches. I focused only on the data from batches so special that I could “taste” them in my memory months or years after physically tasting them. That effort yielded what I think of as the “commandments of roasting.”

 Our seasonal espresso offering is comprised of one or two of our curated selections, with a slightly altered roast profile to increase caramelization, reduce the intensity of acidity, and have the optimal roast solubility to extract as espresso. It can be brewed as filter, but will have increased body, lending itself better to milk. Our other single origins can also be extracted as espresso, however will require higher brew ratios to achieve a balanced extraction.As of May 9th, Bar Nine Espresso is La Plata, Dario Quilindo, Huila, Colombia

 Our roast days are Monday and Wednesday. All coffee is roasted to order and ships one day after the day it was roasted.
 ﻿All of our coffee is now flushed with nitrogen when bagged, creating an inert atmosphere that improves freshness. An unopened bag of coffee can now retain freshness for 4+ weeks.

 Welcome to Our Worldof Specialty Coffee
  Say hello! Find us at our signature cafés or one of the great local cafés serving Toby’s Estate.
 Toby’s Estate speciality coffee, tea and chocolate is  now available at our Rodyk Street store.
 
	Pepe and his son, also Pepe (who also has a son, you guessed it, named Pepe) got into coffee farming to give back to the earth what the earth had so kindly given to them. Pepe Mayor had the opportunity to see many parts of the world as he served as an ambassador of Ecuador in various countries over the years. Similarly, Pepe Menor traveled many parts of the world as a professional climber for a number of years, and he became the first Latin American to climb all the highest peaks in all 7 continents. After many years of traveling and spending time in nature, the father-son duo decided to start a coffee farm, rooted in the belief that their style of sustainable farming is one of the best ways to strengthen the ecosystem in their region.
 
	This special selection from the farm is made up of 100% Typica Mejorada, a Typica-like variety common in the area. The process of production is traditional, yet incredibly particular and detailed. Only “sangre de toro” (dark red) cherries are picked and pulped before receiving natural-air fermentation and thorough washing and slow drying on raised beds in the mountains. The process is kept simple, yet regularly tested, refined, and explored to make sure only the cleanest and tastiest results are coming out of each lot.
 
	The family-owned operation started farming coffee under the name Cafe Instinto (coffee instinct) due to their core values, which are “passion and instinct.” They strive to work in harmony with the land as much as possible and to test out many farming techniques to minimize their footprint on the land. The farm pays their workers some of the highest wages we’ve seen and also offers competitive salaries and benefits to their full-time employees.
 
	With all of the diligence and care that goes into the process, the cost of production is quite high, but so is the quality of life and work environment on the farm. While the process places a heavy emphasis on quality, the real secret in producing such vibrant and unique coffee, according to Pepe Menor, is that the coffee is alive. The coffee experiences the passion of the family as every single seed is individually touched at at least one stage in the process. Each night the coffee listens to classic rock on vinyl (particularly Jimi Hendrix) as it is blasted from the system of their bamboo home located in the center of farm.
 Floral and lightly fruity, Meadow is like a summer breeze. The blend of Rooibos and chamomile is soothing and sweet. Caffeine free.
 Ingredients: Egyptian chamomile, South African rooibos, fragrant hyssop, linden flowers, lemon myrtle, rose petals, safflower, cyani flowers and natural flavors.

 Meadow is a blend of golden Egyptian chamomile flowers and mildly stimulating, fragrant hyssop joined with smooth Cape rooibos, rose petals and linden flowers. Rooibos has a tea-like flavor without the astringency of black tea.
 Rooibos, also known as red bush, grows about 250 km north of Cape Town. Introduced to Egypt from Europe a half century ago, chamomile brings the joy of festive harvest to the city of Fayoum. Here, the Nile provides ample water and fertile soil for the world’s finest tasting blossoms. Harvest season for these golden buds is January to April.

 It’s been many years since a coffee from Papua New Guinea has been on our menu, and it hasn’t been for lack of wanting. This lot from the Aiyura Valley in the Eastern Highlands is from a 34 Hectare washing station/ plantation owned by a gentleman named Sero Bebes - and what a fantastic job done by those who delivered to this station!
 Papua New Guinea is home to many Typica and Bourbon selections, including ones like Arusha, and Blue Mountain. When we cupped this initially, with clean, articulated notes of Aloe juice, tropical fruits, and zippy raspberry, we knew we needed to share it with you.
 For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
 
			Known for a unique quality of processing and drying, coffee from Kenya is very exciting. It’s washed and soaked twice in a style called “Double Fermentation” and then dried on raised beds. As with all styles of processing, when done well it can yield unparalleled results. We’ve been traveling to Kenya ourselves since 2011 and over the years, have had the privilege of many of their phenomenal coffees passing through our roasterie.
		
 Coffee production in Kenya is handled mainly by co-ops, and every factory or washing station sorts its coffee by bean size, with AA being the largest. Many in Kenya believe that the larger the coffee bean, the higher the quality, which drives prices much higher for those given the AA grade. While this is often the case, we believe that the AB coffees can be just as good.
 Kenyan coffee runs on a well-established auction system. Each week, all the bidding exporters will cup and taste over 1500 coffees to decide which ones to buy through the auction. Although it’s a strong system for buying coffee, our preference is always to work more directly with particular factories year after year. Thankfully, great exporting companies like Dormans Coffee allow us direct access through their sister company Coffee Management Services (CMS) to all the lots of particular top factories or washing stations that we enjoy. We pay a premium for these coffees (higher than auction prices) but we believe it’s well worth it for the chance to have the same Kenyan coffees every year.

 You can subscribe to  Decaf Noir.
 A water process decaf that is vivid and packed with flavor, Decaf Noir is made from 100% organic water processed decaffeinated beans from Mexico and Sumatra. If you drink it strong, store it carefully and use it up quickly (buy a smaller amount and try to use it up in a week), you will be rewarded with very big flavors. The decaf Noir is surprisingly (some say freakishly) versatile: about the only preparation we don’t see consistently enjoyable results in is the siphon.

 Throughout the years of civil war and unrest in Nicaragua, Don Anibal kept growing low‐rise vegetables like bell pepper, onions, and cabbage on his valley farm. He was moderately successful, but his dreams were up in the clouds. When peace finally came to the Nubarrones, that’s exactly where he went: the highlands of Nubarrones (“thunderclouds”).
 Up in the Nubarrones, he bought a modest 37 acres‐‐that’s about two Dolores Parks, for you locals. Unlike Dolores Park, this farm lacked roads. There are probably a lot of other things at Dolores Park that Anibal’s new farm lacked, but a way to and from the moutainside farm… well, that was a bit of a hurdle.
 Don Anibal spent more of his vegetable farm profits on a few mules to ferry supplies up and down until he finished the road. He expanded the farm in all directions. All the while, Anibal’s long‐held dream continued to glow in the back of his mind: the chance to start a coffee farm, up among the clouds.

 Uraga returns to our offerings list this season as one of a handful of stellar cooperative coffees we are showcasing from Ethiopia. Uraga is quite possibly the finest example of the best coffee Ethiopia's southern Guji Zone has to offer. The extremely high altitude and semi-forested landscape of Guji contribute to this unique flavor profile. This cup is stunning from start to finish: flavors of watermelon and milk chocolate cool to expose refined notes of tea rose and stone fruit.
 Fresh coffee is roasted on Sundays and Wednesdays and shipped the following day. Please place your order by 8:00 PM Eastern Time the evening before the respective roast day to ensure that it is included.

 Yellow Bourbon is a natural cross between Red Bourbon and Amarelo de Botacuto, which is labelled as a Typica variant with yellow fruit. Bourbon resulted from selections made by French botanists in wild Yemeni coffee groves. Moved to controlled fields for propagation, the relatively humble stock produced a remarkable variety and was given the namesake of its nursery - Bourbon Island - upon its introduction to South American. Under expanded cultivation in Brazil, a yellow mutant with a unique flavor profile expressed itself and was isolated, expanded, and named for its color.
 This Variety Select lot comes to us courtesy of five small farmers from the villages surrounding the municipality of Iquira. With volcanic soil, anaverage temperature of 20-25° C, and 160 CM of annual rainfall, this area is extremely conducive to the cultivation of coffee. Generally, these farmers are processing only ripe cherries the same day of harvest using a dry fermentation of 18-24 hours. The coffees are then washed, and dried in parabolicos for an average duration of 12-18 days.

 Region: Shakiso, OromiaFarm: Kayon Mountain Varietal: TypicaAltitude: 1900–2200 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed & Sun Dried
 The Kayon Mountain Coffee Farm is owned by multiple families that have been born and raised around the experience of coffee. These share-holding members had mainly been supplying coffee to auction for the past 30 years until they started their farm in 2012. This farm boasts a 500 hecatarespread, of which half is planted in heriloom Typica coffee and the other land reserved for cabbage, and indigenous shade trees. By 2015, they had implimented washing stations and dry-hullers allowing them to start exporting their own coffees and now see an annual production of about 300 tonnes. The coffees see an average fermentation time of 24-26 hours, followed by an average drying time of 12-20 days. As for the future, Kayon Mountain plans to plant more coffee, improve the quality of their processing, and even begin leasing more land to expand their practice.
 The ECX was started in 2008 to help protect farmers from market forces that might prevent them from making a living. Most of the coffee in Ethiopia is produced by small-holders who own 0.7 hectares, bumper crops often lead to big price drops, which can make it unprofitable for farmers to harvest their coffee. What the ECX does is commoditize grains- including sesame, beans, maize, wheat, and most importantly, coffee. This ensures prompt payment to farmers. It also integrates all parts of the “eco-system” involved in a grains market, including warehousing, grading, trading, and payment. Access to information is emphasized, as farmers can obtain information about trading prices and local delivery points easily through dedicated telephone lines.
 Here is a general rundown of how the ECX chain works in Ethiopia:
 While this system does ensure prompt payment and streamlines supply chain issues, it removes essentially all traceability from the coffee. This is problematic in the specialty world, where traceability is paramount.
 The ECX does not allow for complete traceability, but coffee cooperatives in Ethiopia do have the ability to go around the ECX and export the coffee themselves. Coffees that are exported by a cooperative can have traceability, possibly even to a single farmer.

	Best of Huila is a cupping competition created for roasters and green buyers to pick the very best coffees they can find. The top 12 coffees out of 750 submissions were cupped, ranked and auctioned where the roasters bid on their favorites. Our new coffee from Colombia was the highest scoring regional coffee cupped at the event where Mike Perry was earlier this year. It also comes from the ASOCAMPO cooperative in Timana where the 1st Roasters United event was held, and where Mike met the famous Yuri Maryeth Cuellar Rojas. 
	
	The international jury in Colombia found this coffee to be a classic Huila with notes of spicy fruit, sweet chocolate and creamy body when hot. 
As it cools down, it presents bright orange, lime and raspberry notes. 
Timana is a small, coffee-centric town on the road between Neiva and Pitalito in the department of Huila, Colombia. 
	
	The people of Timana have historically been revered as extremely hardworking and passionate beings, especially when it comes to coffee production.

 The sweet, savory blend that started it all, and our most popular coffee. When you die and go to heaven, all the diners serve Hair Bender.
 This complex and sweet cup starts with a round, full cherry splash and finishes with warm chocolate and toffee flavors.

 Named for a long-shuttered beauty parlor that housed the first Stumptown location, Hair Bender was the very first blend that Stumptown-founder Duane Sorenson introduced to the world. In fact, we still have the Hair Bender sign in our headquarters, watching over us as we roast each batch.
 It’s our most popular coffee with good reason. A cup of Hair Bender has clarity and complexity; Indonesia’s rich textures are balanced by the classic flavors of Latin America and Africa. We use it at our cafes for espresso, but it’s great for all brew methods.

The Pink Bourbon is one of the rare and high ranking coffees featured at the auction lot competition. Of course, Mike Perry picked this unique and rare bean for all our Klatchaholics to enjoy! 
	
	The farmer/producer of the amazing coffee is Dieber Cifuentes. With the support of his wife, Adriana and daughter Sonia, Dieber became highly encouraged to pursue his passion for coffee by taking his process to the next level. 15 years later his coffee farm, Finca Pedregoza, provides a unique variety of high quality coffee, including the rare Pink Bourbon. Typically, a color description of a coffee cultivar or varietal describes the color of the coffee cherry, however, the Pink Bourbon refers to the color of the coffee shrub leaves as an effect caused by low-lying plants. Dieber was able to capitalize and refine this unique varietal, creating a distinct flavor profile.

 Good idea to have a replacement on hand to prevent weekend meltdowns.

 Orders sent to customers within Germany must select (DE 19% Tax) option which includes tax.
 Welcome to the world of automatic volumetric dosing!  We are happy to announce that we will be offering a first run (officially v2) of these units for sale worldwide.
 This dosing unit operates by placing carefully milled spacer rings inside a cylinder to create a fixed volume that slides effortlessly back and forth between the bottom of a hopper or funnel and the opening of an EK43 grinder.
 Our current series of units will feature a stainless steel funnel ring and an optional stainless steel top plate for the slider bar.  With some wear the slider bar can get stained from the coffee, so if you would like to have this option, please select it at check out.
 After some testing, we have concluded that this dosing unit is more accurate than the variance of standard grinding with the EK43.  With a full hopper we have trial tested the accuracy, with a full hopper, to be +- 2 coffee beans or around +- 0.2g.  What that number and weight is, depends on the evenness of the screen size of the beans.  Single origin coffees, in our testing were more accurate than blends or unevenly screen beans.
 While this unit is perfectly suitable for a high volume workflow, for ultra sensitive brewing it does not take the place of a scale.  However it can save a lot of time over pre-weighing doses and will pay for itself in time savings.
 All units come with enough 1,5mm POM rings to achieve a wide variety of dose sizes.
 We have a limited number of these v2 units being manufactured and we expect to ship our first set of orders from Berlin on June 9th with 3day FedEx worldwide. 
 All units come with a full warranty against defects of materials and craftsmanship in accordance with German law. 
 If you have questions please see our post and comments on our Facebook site.

            White, oxidized paper filter replacements for use with the Clever, Beehouse, or Bonavita Brewer.
          
 While quite a few manufacturers produce similar filters, we like these best. They aren't bonded with harsh glues or chemicals and are not whitened with bleach. Rather, Filtropa uses an oxygen-based whitening process without chlorine. We've also found that these do not impart that papery taste that other paper filters sometimes do. 100 filters per pack.

 We would never tell anyone to “follow” anyone else on any sort of social media “platform” or anything else. But if you had been wasting your life following us back in the summer of 2015, you would have noticed that we visited a place called Rwanda.
 You might have seen our photo of a coffee mill worker garbed in a white lab coat, or other photos of Simbi, which ranks among the cleanest and most highly organized mills we’ve ever encountered.
 We didn’t “post” (as the kids say) photos of the density channels and multiple c-bends that progressively ensure quality as coffee gets washed at the Simbi mill. But they exist, and they’re part of Simbi’s great hybrid of every washing system we’ve ever seen: density, washing, tanks–all in beautiful condition and working in concert.
 Simbi itself is only three years old, and has produced incredible coffee every year. This is the second year that we’ve bought it. The owner, Abdoul Rudahunga, built it to match his vision. He has designed impeccable raised beds leading directly downhill to a natural mountain spring, among other feats of engineering.
 On the human side, he’s dedicated himself to maintaining a good relationship with his farming neighbors and employees. We heard over and over that Simbi was a great working environment–IRL, as we say.

 Cupping notes : Ample-bodied, Forest floor, Licorice
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Breakfast Blend combines distinctly spicy and mildly pungent characteristics of Indo-Pacific coffees. The result is an eye opening blend that is bold yet well rounded, and profound flavors that are sure to illuminate your mornings.
 Cupping notes : Complex, Dynamic, Blueberry
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Elysian refers to a state of bliss or happiness, simply put – heavenly. The Elysian Blend can be characterized as a very rich, full bodied blend with a lot of depth and complexity in flavor. This makes it a good after dinner coffee to enjoy with dessert.
 Cupping notes : Deep Smokiness, Browned Butter, Caramel
Roast level : DARK
 We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as baker’s chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.
 Cupping notes : Smooth smoke, Caramelized sugar, Silky body
Roast level : DARK
 This is our darkest Fair Trade/Organic certified blend. We thoughtfully selected the coffees that make up this blend in order to maintain some of their individual aroma and flavor attributes while standing up to the intensity of the unique way that we roast them. The result is a dark roasted coffee with sweetly smoky flavor, light body and just a glimmer of lemony citrus notes; a perfect way to ease into your morning and a great complement to an evening meal.
 Cupping notes : Chocolate, Caramel, Butterscotch
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Whether approaching by sea or from within the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Strait imbues a sense of magic and wonder. The stunning landscapes and picture perfect sunsets inspired us here at Mr. Espresso to create a blend that attempts to capture its grace and majesty. Dark chocolate, sweet caramel and fruit toned acidity seamlessly blend together to create our homage to this wonder of nature.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 There are seven bridges that keep the people of the Bay Area connected, and the Seven Bridges Blend pays homage to the diversity of people and tastes in the San Francisco Bay Area.
 A blend of Fair Trade and organic certified coffees, the Seven Bridges Blend is a velvety bodied blend with depth and a complex, multilayer flavor dynamic. A favorite among customers and chefs alike, this blend can be found at some of the finest dining establishments around the San Francisco Bay Area.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Silky, Subtle fruit tones
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Countless cafés along the Viennese streets have loaned out their tables to some of the finest thinkers of our time and some of the greatest works of art, politics and philosophy found their inspiration accompanied by a rich cup of coffee. Here at Mr. Espresso we took inspiration from this legacy of creativity when we came up with our Viennese Blend. A combination of our finest dark and light roasted Latin American coffees come together to create a rich, smoky cup with low toned fruit notes and a silky mouth feel.
 Cupping notes : Sweet Chocolate, Vanilla, Cherry
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Named after the restaurant that Carlo’s brother Franco Di Ruocco owned, Ristorante Villanova (Oakland circa 1980) – and the house blend that was served there. Its mild intensity embodies the essential characteristics of a classic American roast, yet reflects our passion for traditional, wood fired roasting. The Villanova House Blend is sweet enough to serve as a dessert coffee and mild enough to enjoy throughout the day.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Smoky, Low-toned acidity
Roast level : DARK
 The choice to use water processed decaf coffees for our Decaffeinated French Roast was necessitated by our desire to deliver our customers a delicious dark roast without caffeine or compromise. A silky mouthfeel and low-toned acidity enables the rich smoky flavor to linger without interruption through the long, resonant finish.
 Cupping notes : Smooth, Well balanced, Medium body
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 This is a blend of water processed decaffeinated Latin American coffees combining to make a smooth, full flavored coffee with medium body and well balanced acidity.
 Cupping notes : Caramelized sugar, Fruit notes, Silky mouth feel
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 This is a blend of African and Indonesian beans decaffeinated by a water process developed in Switzerland, which is considered the most natural method of decaffeinating coffee. Decaffeinated Elysian Blend is a hearty and full flavored blend, which is most unusual of water processed coffees.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Modeled after our Organic Seven Bridges Blend, this coffee has all the positive characteristics of the Organic Seven Bridges Blend without the caffeine. A good alternative for after dinner enjoyment or simply for those who are caffeine sensitive. The coffee is 99.9% caffeine free.

 This delightful smaller sibling to the larger Chemex is perfect for the 1 cup at a time kind of person. With its deeper and more exaggerated cone shape, we find grinding finer than the larger Chemex works really well with this little brewer.
 Pairs with Unfolded 3 Cup Chemex Filters
 This is the classic wood collar design that is now part of the permanent collection at MoMA. It is also one of the most functional coffee brewers out there. The 6 Cup Size is really ideal for making 2 servings at a time. This is a classic for a reason!
 Pairs with Folded Chemex Filters - 6 to 8 cup
 This is the size and style of Chemex we use in-store at Bar Nine. The glass handle makes swirling the liquid after the brew a breeze and additionally allows you to prepare 3 full servings, ideal for the multi-person house-hold or the business looking to get a little more bang for their buck.
 Pairs with Folded Chemex Filters - 6 to 8 cup
 Available for Pick Up Only for our retail customers.

 Cupping is the ultimate tasting and evaluating tool in coffee, it's how we perform quality control, how we decide on green coffee purchase, how we assess consistency cup to cup. There is no better way to assess what a coffee is all about, and this class will show you how to cup like a pro. Will go over technique, scoring, and more.
 The class will be on June 18th at 7:00PM.
 Ever since we've been exposed to "Sugar Processed" Decafs, we've fallen in love. Ethanol is used to extract a solvent found in sugarcane, which extracts the caffeine. Definitely the gentlest non-chemical decaffeination, and to boot this is done in the same country as the coffee was produced, Colombia, also a rarity in decaffeination. Honestly, this just tastes like a really beautiful coffee from Colombia, it just happens to be Decaf.

 Our seasonal espresso offering is comprised of one or two of our curated selections, with a slightly altered roast profile to increase caramelization, reduce the intensity of acidity, and have the optimal roast solubility to extract as espresso. It can be brewed as filter, but will have increased body, lending itself better to milk.

 Kiawamururu is a famous wet mill and co-op near the Mukurwe-ini town in Nyeri, Kenya. The mill screen sorts the AA, AB, and PB sizes, and this AA really impresses us. Juicy red apple acidity and sweetness, this is an exceptionally beautiful coffee.

 Here at La Colombe, we are keenly aware of where our coffee comes from, how it was grown, and, most importantly, the needs of the people involved in the coffee’s journey from seed to cup. We care deeply about the wellbeing of coffee-growing communities, and we strive to implement the best business practices to increase that wellbeing.
 As one of the early pioneers of direct trade, we pride ourselves on proactive, longterm relationships with small-holder farms and socially responsible coffee-growing associations. For us, the quality of our coffee starts with the quality of these relationships. By working directly with farmers to create mutually beneficial partnerships, we can increase transparency in the supply chain, guide farming practices to yield better and better beans, and support the livelihoods of coffee-producing communities.
 Founded in 2013 by La Colombe and the Clinton Foundation, the Haiti Coffee Academy supports coffee farmers in the southeast region of Haiti through education, training, materials, and market access.
 Haiti is a place that is close to our hearts, and a place where coffee production has suffered in recent decades. We are committed to supporting the Haitian coffee industry by buying a significant amount of Haitian coffee each year and bringing their beautiful beans to the U.S. craft coffee market. Learn more about the Haiti Coffee Academy here.
 Around the world, millions of people and thousands of communities lack access to clean drinking water. We believe that access to water is an inherent human right, and we partner with organizations who share this philosophy. By providing free drinking water in our cafes, we seek to raise awareness about water initiatives in the hopes that one day, everyone will have equal access to this life-giving resource.
 Fairness – All trading partners are to be treated fairly. No strike price is ever to be below that established by the Fair Trade Organization. Additionally, farm workers' wages must be verifiable fair, working conditions must be humane and basic health must be made available.
 Longevity – Long-term commitments are to be established with all coffee sources, thereby providing a more certain future for our trading partners.
 Opportunity – Priority is given to nations, regions and farmers with the greatest need and where our purchases can make the greatest impact.
 Water – Access to clean drinking water must be provided by the farmer to the families associated with our supplier farms.
 Strictly Earth Conscious – Earth Conscious coffees are coffees grown on farms that hold at least two earth friendly certifications.
 In addition to supporting our coffee-producing communities, we seek to support, nurture, and enhance the local neighborhoods that are home to our cafes. From providing free coffee to a nearby homeless shelter to helping with the community garden across the street, we work hard to engage with our environment and create meaningful connections with our neighbors.

 Figured we hadn't posted the video from the Nordic Roaster Forum November 2015 in Copenhagen just yet. The talk is not perfect at all, however it sums up alot about our roasting philosophy.  As said in the beginning, knowledge in coffee roasting is developing so quickly and all we can promise year...

MONDAY ROAST ONLY - *ORDERS MUST BE PLACED BY SUNDAY MIDNIGHT TO BE ROASTED ON MONDAY MORNING.

 
	We're excited to offer our newest Hawaiian coffee! This is a result of Mike Perry's direct trade trip a couple of months back, and was also the featured speaker at the Caribou coffee festival. This high-end bean offers a sweet, rare and lively cup that starts with a bright floral and citrus aroma. The flavors present a vibrant mixture of black cherry, tropical fruits, vanilla, brown sugar and passionfruit. The aftertaste brings out subtle hints of white wine and tangerine, giving well-rounded and memorable cup worth Klatching about!
	

	Generally, beans from the islands are known for being mild, soft and sweet. This coffee, by contrast, is very intense (Grind it, and the aroma of tropical fruits fills the room)!
	
	It’s also very unique for a natural-dried coffee. Instead of the simple grape and berry flavors that often result from this processing method, there are enhanced characteristics of Yellow Caturra. The result is a strikingly good pairing of processing method and coffee variety.
	
	Rusty and Lorie Obra started their Hawaiian coffee farm in 1999, they stumbled upon an award-winning coffee region. Of course, they didn't know it at the time. The couple simply wanted to live in the Ka'u District, the southern side of the Big Island known for the Green Sand Beach near Ka Lae (South Point), the Punalu'u Black Sand Beach, and the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.
	

	Rusty, a retired chemist, arrived first. He took over 12 acres of an old sugarcane farm on the slope of the Mauna Loa volcano and started planting coffee trees. Lorie, a medical technologist, soon sold their New Jersey home and followed him to Hawaii.
	

	The couple quickly expanded their business to become farmers, processors and roasters of coffee. Because of their science background, the two ran their farm like a laboratory. They started testing different processing methods and roasts, looking for ones that would bring out the best flavors in their coffee. Rusty also organized the Ka'u Coffee Growers Cooperative, a group of about 30 Ka'u coffee farmers.
	

	Then Rusty passed away in 2006, leaving Lorie at a crossroads. Could she handle the business with all of its manual labor on her own? Lorie thought about selling the farm, but she couldn't let go of Rusty's dream: to make Ka'u coffee one of the best in the world.
	

	In 2007, Ka'u was vindicated at the Specialty Coffee Association of America's annual conference. Two of Lorie's fellow farmers in the Ka'u Coffee Growers Cooperative won 6th and 9th place in the Roaster's Guild Cupping Pavilion Competition. That same year, Rusty's Hawaiian was one of seven farms that ranked in the SCAA's top 10 Hawaii/Asia/Indonesia regional competition.
	

	The recognition and subsequent awards for Ka'u coffee -- strengthened Lorie's dedication. Lorie currently is president of the Ka'u Coffee Growers Cooperative. She was one of the organizers of the first Ka'u Coffee Festival, held in April 2009. She also continues to refine the processing and roasting methods at Rusty's Hawaiian. She has been recognized by "Coffee Review: The World's Leading Coffee Buying Guide" for her "artisan meticulousness."

 Marda Loop features light wood panels, high ceilings, and a long coffee bar. We wanted the space to be warm, inviting and elegant, but look different than the average cafe.
 Our menu is constantly changing with the seasons and mirrors our coffee program.
 Our food philosophy is quite simple. There’s peace of mind in knowing where our food comes from – that the ingredients we use are from small, quality-driven farms, mostly located right here in Alberta. These ingredients are usually only found in high-end restaurants (accompanied by high-end restaurant prices), but we’re committed to using these same artisanal ingredients in a casual cafe menu. Here are some of the producers we work with: Vital Greens, D Dutchmen Dairy, The Fresh Squeeze, Coco Karamel, Winter’s Turkey, Ewe-Nique Farms, Sylvan Star Cheese, Highwood Crossing, Yum Bakery, Valbella and Sidewalk Citizen.
 Marda Loop also features a variety of baked goods, treats, sandwiches, soups and salads. We roast our meats in house and make nearly everything in house. We bake most of our baked goods ourselves daily in the Marda Loop kitchen.
 Our friendship with Aviv Fried started back in 2008 and we’ve been working with him and his bakery, Sidewalk Citizen, ever since.  Over the past year, we decided to work more closely together and offer a wide range of Sidewalk Citizen treats at the cafes.
 Love our Marda Loop cafe for more than just your morning coffee? Host your next meeting or event in our space and discover what else it can do!
 For more information about booking your next event contact our very own josie@philsebastian.com or visit our cafe rentals page.
 Phil & Sebastian love a good party, so bring them and a carrier of freshly brewed coffee with you to the next one – we promise they won’t tell any cheesy jokes.
 Call or visit any of our locations to bring Phil & Sebastian to your next gathering. To learn more about your options visit our catering page.

 A: We ship online orders Monday through Friday. If a major U.S. holiday falls on one of those days you can expect your coffee to go out the next available shipping day. The cut off time for getting your order in to ship the FOLLOWING day is 12pm. Examples: if you get your order in before 12pm on Monday, your package will ship on Tuesday; if you get your order in after 12pm on Thursday, your order will not ship until the following Monday. Note: Coffee Subscriptions only ship on Tuesday or Friday of each week. 
 A: This depends on where you are and how fast you need your coffee. USPS Priority mail takes about 2-3 days to get anywhere in the U.S. however, their delivery times are not guaranteed and they do not deliver on Sunday. If choosing a FedEx option like express or 2 day shipping, keep in mind that these are business days and the weekends don’t count. For example, if you choose FedEx 2 day shipping and your package goes out Friday, your package will not arrive until the following Tuesday. Please see the color coded map below for FedEx Ground time in transit.
 A: First, check your tracking number that gets emailed to you upon shipping! If you chose to ship USPS and the tracking states that the package has been delivered, call your local post office. They can tell you what happened, often they have it there waiting to be claimed. If nobody claims the package, it sits at the warehouse, and we do not hear about it until it ships back to us 30 days later. If you chose to ship FedEx, check your tracking number and read the progress of the transit time. When there are severe weather warnings, shipping is often delayed. If this is the case, FedEx does not reimburse shipping costs, therefore, heart doesn’t reimburse for severe weather delays. If you live on the east coast and ship FedEx Ground, keep in mind that your package will take 5-6 business days to reach you… this means 7-8 days including the weekend. It is very important that you are proactive with missing or delayed packages. Once the package has left the facility, it is out of our hands. Please make sure your address is correct, there aren’t any weather delays, and that you select the fastest shipping option that works best for you! 
 A: We offer free shipping on orders of $65 or more within the United States.
 A: We can ship coffee anywhere, but keep in mind that it is rather expensive to ship internationally. The recipient is responsible for paying all brokerage, duties, and taxes associated with international shipping.
 A: All packages are insured within the United States through USPS and FedEx. If your coffee is damaged upon arrival, we can ship you a new bag, no problem. Packages are only insured if they never show up, or the contents are damaged. Unfortunately it does not cover perishable items like coffee, and as long as it shows up (even if it takes a month) we cannot reimburse you. 
 A: For merchandise, apparel, and/or brew equipment purchases: If merchandise, apparel, and/or brew equipment is broken or defective upon arrival, you may return or exchange the product within 30 days from purchase. If you want to make a return on merchandise, apparel, and/or brew equipment that is not broken or defective, the product must be unused, in its' original packaging and within 30 days from purchase. If we receive the product and it appears to be used you will not be refunded. Heart does not cover the return shipping cost for the product. For international packages, we are willing to replace merchandise damaged in transit. However, we would need the damaged goods returned and unfortunately we can not cover the shipping costs. Please contact coffee@heartroasters and a heart representative will get back to you with further information.
 For coffee purchases: We cannot guarantee refunds on coffee purchases. If you have purchased coffee beans from heart and are not satisfied or if you have purchased a coffee subscription and wish to cancel the remainder due to dissatisfaction, please email coffee@heartroasters.com and a heart representative will get back to you with further information.
 A: We only offer coffee subscriptions for those in North America. Please email us prior to placing your order, so we can take your order over the phone. We will adjust the cost of the subscription to accommodate the extra shipping charges.
 A: Please feel free to email us at coffee@heartroasters.com to get more information.

 Kiumu landed stateside early this year thanks in part to the collaboration with our export partners in Kenya. Kiumu represents the next chapter in our mission to develop a quality-founded relationship coffee with a single estate producer in the region. Last year, this budding exploration brought us to Muranga County. During our travels we were fortunate to meet John Njoroge, who owns and personally manages Kiumu, a parcel of a 100 acre estate which he shares with his brothers. Parlor is in the nascent stage of an exclusive relationship with John: we purchased every one of John’s Kiumu lots this year because we believe in the potential of this coffee. John Njoroge’s Kiumu is ripe with flavors coveted in the finest Kenyan coffees: juicy stone fruits meld with citrus notes and make way for a remarkable flavor of fresh blackberry. We are excited for the evolution of this relationship coffee throughout this season and for seasons to come.
 Fresh coffee is roasted every Sunday, Monday and Wednesday and shipped the following day. Please place your order by 5:00 PM Eastern Time the evening before the respective roast day to ensure that it is included.

 Sweet Cherry / Peach Pie / Jasmine Sencha
 The climate and geography of Eastern Congo are a dream for growing coffee. However, to live in Congo is truly a nightmare. 
 Lake Kivu comes to us from the over 5,600 members of the Sopacdi cooperative, on the shores of Lake Kivu. Most of these farmers have recently returned to their homes after being driven away by the rebel troops spilling over from Rwanda. Over twenty percent of the cooperative’s membership are women. Many are widows whose husbands died trying to smuggle their coffee into Rwanda while the Conogolese market was virtually non-exsistent. They live in small, remote villages in the mountainous highlands surrounding Lake Kivu. The cooperative is headquartered in the village of Minova, where they just completed building the first coffee washing-station in Congo in over forty years. Additionally, this is the first coffee from DR Congo to acheive the top national grade - Kivu 2 - since 1967.
 Lake Kivu’s first sip springs forward with tones of fresh cherry, developing into notes of fresh-cut flowers, clementine, peach, and buttery pie crust. As the cup cools, the floral tones open up into earthy green tea acting as a nice foundation for the brighter, sweet fruit we see in the forefront. This coffee is very juicy, turning into a slightly dry effervescent mouth-feel in the finish which reminded us of Bottle Cap candies. It is the perfect coffee to greet the oncoming summer sunshine.

       Water Avenue Coffee.

 
	A little over 3 years ago we were in a bind. The Ethiopian coffees we had coming in for the season were all running late and we really wanted a fresh vibrant Ethiopian coffee to get on our menu for the interim. In that search, we stumbled upon Reko, a coffee that ended up being so much more than we could ever have expected and we bought up as much of that harvest as we could. Now, Reko has become a staple in our line-up.

	Our Director of Coffee, Ryan Knapp, had the chance to visit the mill a few months after we purchased our first harvest from Reko and he has cupped through nearly every batch of coffee they have produced each season. Aside from the elevation of the mill, which is as high as we’ve ever seen (at up to 2,200 meters), the mill itself operates very similarly to others in the area. They have long 36-hour fermentation times after the coffee is pulped, they thoroughly wash the coffee in long channels followed by a 12-hour soak, and then the coffee is dried on raised beds for about 2 weeks while workers pick through the parchment to clean it up.
 
	Like many excellent coffees, what really separates Reko from the others is in the details. The first thing we noticed was the pride the team at Reko took in their product. The specific care taken when evaluating the fermentation tanks, the strenuous effort placed into the washing, and the precision used at the drying tables demonstrate their passion for their work. All along, the workers were smiling, often singing and chanting as they processed the coffee. The team at Reko has a lot to be proud of as they continue to produce such a special coffee year after year. In 2015 our Reko was a Good Food Award winner, and  we’ve secured a large amount of Reko this season and expect to have it around through 2016.
 From the Gilmore Girls to Ghostbusters, this is the year of the revival. Sure, it’s not terribly original, but so what? Neil Young opening for Paul McCartney? Sure, why not? Likewise, here we are working with the Zelaya family yet again, and roasting up another incredible Guatemalan coffee.
 Luis Pedro Zelaya Aguirre and Luis Pedro Zelaya Zamora are pretty dependable guys (like Bruce Springsteen), and we’ve been working with them for years now (like Bono and The Edge). They know what we like, and that we pay for great coffee, so they’re always looking to hook us up with local producers.
 This particular coffee is one of their own‐‐it’s from Buena Vista, the farm that Luis Sr has semi‐retired to. But like Mick and Keith, his idea of retirement is pretty active. And Buena Vista just keeps improving. From the symmetrical rows of shade trees to the shrubs pruned back at the slightest hint of leaf rust, the operation is tight. Tight like the encore of a Rush concert.
 We certainly understand why Luis Sr. likes focusing on Buena Vista. All it takes is a ride up the farm’s steep slope, switchback after switchback, to get a free view of the sun setting over all of Antigua. And that’s a show that’s been on every night for years, and never, ever gets old.

 Mission is intended to pay homage to espresso’s Italian heritage. It features natural elements such as teak wood panels, marble counters and mid century Italian lighting.
 Our brewing methods change frequently and presently, we are using the AeroPress method. We use a Quooker for hot water delivery and Bonavita kettles to brew the coffees. We use an Everpure Reverse Osmosis system to deliver water around 70PPM.
 We decided to change it up with Mission, sporting a 3-group Kees van der Westen Spirit machine and a pair of Nuova Simonelli Clima Pro grinders.
 Our menu is constantly changing with the seasons and mirrors our coffee program.

 We’re as serious about our beer as we are about our coffee. To that end, we endeavour to offer a bottle list that rivals the best in Calgary. We’ll carry seasonal and special releases and look for breweries willing to take risks and push the limits of traditional styles.
 Both Sebastian and Phil are passionate about wine, in fact, it was their segue into coffee. As such, we’re very excited to bring unique and approachable wine offerings to our cafes. These are the wines that fly under the radar and quietly way-out-drink their price point.
 Our award winning café design + your next meeting or event = party bliss.
 For more information about booking your next event contact our very own josie@philsebastian.com or visit our cafe rentals page.
 No one likes to show up to an event empty handed, so pick up one of our stylish Phil & Sebastian coffee carriers on your way and keep your street cred in good standing. We can even carry the pastries to your car for you (you’re welcome).
