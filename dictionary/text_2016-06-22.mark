 Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee: it is in the forests of the Kaffa region that Coffea Arabica grew wild. Coffee is "Bun" or "Buna" in Ethiopia, so Coffee Bean is quite possibly a poor anglicized interpretation of "Kaffa Bun". We consider Ethiopian coffees to be some of the best in the world, and extreme genetic diversity of the coffee shrub is certainly part of the reason why. Most of the coffee is either wet-processed - resulting in a vividly bright cup, with fruit and floral notes - or dry-processed with the fruit skin intact.  The latter technique produces a very  different, rustic fruited flavor profile, and with thicker body.
 Coffea Arabica was also found in the Harar region quite early, either brought from the Kaffa forests or from closer areas around the Sudan border. It is entirely possible that slaves taken from the forests chewed coffee cherry and spit out the seeds, thus spreading it into the Harar region, through which the Muslim slave trade route passed.
 Ethiopian coffees are available from some regions as dry-processed, from some regions as washed, or as both.  The difference between the cup profiles produced by "natural" and washed methods is profound. Washed Sidamo, Yirga Cheffe and Limmu have lighter body and less earthy/wild tastes in the cup then their dry-processed kinfolk.
 Essentially, coffee is a type of produce, and Ethiopian coffee reminds me more and more of this fact. When you find a really great coffee like the dry-processed types from the South, it is like eating Michigan peaches at the height of the season - sweet, juicy, fruity, and ripe with flavor. But then those peaches are gone, and you hope that the next season will produce the same results.  Similarly, the cup profile of these coffees can be equally amazing, but when they're gone, they're gone. If all the factors line up just right, it might be the same next year. But then again, maybe not.
 Ethiopian coffees can vary greatly from lot to lot. It takes a whole lot of cupping to find the specific lot of coffee that is superior to the rest. When I find the best coffee, I buy the majority of the year's production immediately, leaving a small opening in case any other good lots come along later in the season. With dry-processed Ethiopian coffee we're able to do this at the beginning of the season. These early coffees tend to be best, which is in contradiction with many other origins where the earliest are often underdeveloped.
 We have many pictures and notes about Ethiopia coffee in our travelogs, namely a cupping trip to Addis and an interesting trek to Dire Dawa and Harar in the east. Since that first trip I've been back every year covering the regions in the West and South in particular - usually 2-4 times per harvest.

 Jamaica, a great place to visit, but what about the coffee? The world's best or most over-rated? I can say for sure that it is not the world's best coffee, and no serious coffee taster would ever attempt that argument. It has potential to be a decent, mild coffee, if harvested and processed well, and if promptly and carefully transported. We found that the post-harvest processing is rarely done well, that the humidity of the climate challenges the stability of the green bean, and it rarely realizes its potential in the cup. On top of that, a lot of coffee sold as Jamaican is not true Jamacia Blue Mountain, or is blended. If you pay $15 per Lb. for Jamaica coffee, it cannot be true Blue Mountain. It is either the lower-grown Jamaica High Mountain, or most likely a blend that contains a small percentage of JBM.
 The history of coffee in Jamaica is epic. In 1728, Sir Nicholas Lawes, then Governor of Jamaica, imported coffee into Jamaica from Martinique. The country was ideal for this cultivation and nine years after its introduction 83,000 lbs. of coffee was exported. Between 1728 and 1768, the coffee industry developed largely in the foothills of St. Andrew, but gradually the cultivation extended into the Blue Mountains. Since then, the industry has experienced many rises and falls, with some farmers abandoning coffee for livestock and other crops. In order to save the industry, legislation was passed in 1891 "to provide instructions in the art of cultivation and curing coffee by sending to certain districts, competent instructors." Efforts were made to increase the production of coffee and to establish a Central Coffee Work for processing and grading. This effort to improve quality, however, was not very successful. Until 1943 it was unacceptable to the Canadian market, which at the time was the largest buyer of Jamaican coffee. In 1944 the government established a Central Coffee Clearing House where all coffee for export had to be delivered to the Clearing House where it was cleaned and graded. Improvement in the quality of Jamaica's coffee export was underway. In June 1950 the Coffee Industry Board was established to officially raise and maintain the quality of coffee exported.
 The Blue Mountain region is in the Eastern part of the island, and only coffee grown within can be called JBM. Jamaica High Mountain refers to coffee grown outside the true region. Wallenford (recently sold after a period in receivership) and Mavis Bank are the two most prominent names, Old Tavern is a third. Moy Hall is a co-op created from one of the older farms, and one of the 4 certified sources along with the above-mentioned in 1951. But these are not farms, they are coffee mills that purchase coffee from the surround JBM small farms and mills it. I am concerned that Wallenford is milled at sea-level in Kingston --not a good practice (of course, if the cup is good i will buy it regardless of my biases).
 Mavis Bank is milled and stored at altitude. They have really improved the output with better quality preparation. But remember, the cup is mild, mild, mild. If you are new to roasting and determined to roast JBM, try the smallest amount in an order, along with a really good Central (a Guatemalan for example), a really good Ethiopia Yirgacheffe, a really good auction lot Kenya, a premium small-farm Colombian. In the larger scheme of things, a very good JBM cups simply as a clean, mild cup, soft but uninspiring next to these muscular coffees with pronounced cup character.
 Here are some older roasting tips I had noted for Jamaican Coffee: Like other island origins, even the best, highest-grown Jamaican coffees lack the very high elevations of an origin such as Kenya or Guatemala or Colombia. This leads to a lower bean density in the cell structure, and a different roast treatment. You should roast this coffee with a lower initial temperature during the warmup stage, until the coffee is yellow/light-brown in color. Our drum roasters like the Behmor or HotTop have fairly low initial temperatures already. You can really kill JBM with a high initial temperature and a short roast time. You should use an initial environment temperature of less than 350 F, and gently bring in up after 4 minutes or so, shooting for a total roast time of no less than 11 minutes. On the air roast side, an air popper or the Freshroast is a bit fast, so use 20% less coffee to allow more air flow and an even warm-up of the coffee through the yellowing stages.

 Timor Leste is the independent nation occupying the eastern half of the island, with the western portion being a part of former foe, Indonesia. Before  the independence was declared from Portugal in 1975, East Timor was producing coffee and sandalwood as its chief exports. Small scale coffee farming was revitalized by  cooperative farming associations, with funding from USAID grants, to  aid the minimal incomes of the rural population.
 The  independence of the cooperatives and the presence of some technical support from NGO groups emboldened the spirit of the Timorese toward independence. Development of the output of these coffee coops was geared toward producing full container loads of Fair Trade and Organic certified lots. Some regional names were developed in the Specialty market such as Maubisse (or Maubesse) and Aifu. But these were often used quite loosely as coffee types, not geographical indicators of the origin of the coffee.
 Because the coffee of Timor Leste has been bulked from many small farms, it has been offered as a meta-regional "specialty" coffee in the most limited sense. There is quality potential because of the old variety of coffee planted here, but regional or farmer separations do not exist. And when regional lots do exist, they aren't coming from groups of well-trained farmers growing, milling and drying coffee to high and uniform standards. There is much agricultural outreach work to do here in that respect, as well as combatting the complacency of growers who have not attained significant premiums for their coffee. 
 Arabica (and Robusta) are planted here at quite low altitudes (I marked arabica at 750 meters), with a bulk of arabica at a moderate 1100-1200 meters. I have seen coffee at 1600 meters and I am sure there is some higher up, but it represents a very small volume. Farms here suffer huge biennial swings in cherry production. It's the nature of coffea arabica, but without great agricultural practice (some coffee simply plants itself here, as in Ethiopia "semi-forest coffee") the ups and downs of the crop cycle are huge in volume.
 The tradition here is wet-processing, unlike Indonesian regional origins like Sumatra and Sulawesi that historically wet-hulled. The difference between wet-hulled and wet-processed may seem very small. Both are picked, pulped of skin, fermented and washed. The difference is that wet-hulled coffees are removed from parchment when still at high moisture (25% or more) then dried on patios as exposed green bean. Wet-processed coffees are allowed to slowly dry in the parchment, then rested in warehouses to stabilize, then hulled at 10-11% moisture. The cup difference is huge. Wet-hulled are more earthy, funky, have lower acidity and larger body. Wet-processed can be brighter, more uniform, lighter body, cleaner cup taste. 
 But wet-processed Indonesian coffees, and near neighbors like Timor, still retain some of the unusual foresty flavors as well. Sometimes this is due to poor quality wet-processing, and Timor has many such washing stations in disrepair, and where the picking and processing are not ideal. But exotic notes can sometimes come from the variety of coffee, such as these giant, old Bourbon-like trees found in Timor, and other environmental factors, not from taints in processing. 
 Interestingly, Timor is where the coffee variety of the same name originates.  But I discovered that you will not likely find Timor-type coffee planted anywhere in Timor! What is Timor variety? Timor variety is a natural mutation between Robusta and Arabica, which do not easily cross because of they are genetically incompatible: They don't cross pollinate as Arabica coffee is self-pollinating. Coffea Canephora, aka Robusta, is not. The discovery of the natural cross between the two was a milestone in coffee variety research, because of the need for an arabica plant with the disease resistence of a robusta.
 Timor variety is planted in its pure form in some origins. In Sumatra it is called TimTim. The cup is generally poor in quality though, with woody, herbacious or astringent notes. Timor variety is more significant for all the progeny it created from further crosses. The most significant and widely planted is Catimor, a cross of Timor and Caturra. Catimor usually has poorer cup quality than other types such as Typica and Bourbon due to the Robusta genetic content. Other crosses with Timor genetic content are Costa Rica 95, IHcafe 90, Ruiru 11, Sarchimor, and Castillo.
 I noticed that the older arabica trees have many physical characteristics associated with Bourbon variety coffee. But locally the old type is called Moka (or Mocha). Since coffee is documented to have been spread to Reunion Island (Bourbon) from Yemen, the Moka name could be fanciful or factual, it is hard to say. But the coffee is not the extremely small bean variety of Moka for sure.
 Around the sea-level capital of Dili are the coffee dry mills of various exporters, in various states of repair. The market was dominated by 3 companies including the USAID-funded NCBI that did much work to organize small-holder farmers. Timor Corp was a large privately-held company that exported around 300 containers in a good year. I am told total exports could be 600 containers, all of these transfrieghted through nearby ports as Dili is not a deepwater port for larger vessels.
 The issue with Dili is heat and humidity. In fact much coffee from the interior comes to Dili not fully dry. Huge fields exist outside the major dry mills where farmers or middlemen re-dry coffee brought from the interior on tarps. When the coffee hits the required moisture level (usually 11%) it is milled out of the parchment skin and immediately bagged and loaded for export.
 This presents quality problems on several levels. Coffee that is bulked up when not truly dry will never have great cup quality, or worse, it will have moldy taste. And coffee that is dried quickly, milled and exported without a resting period lacks physical stability and moisture equilibrium, and the cup quality will rapidly fade upon import.
 Timor is well suited toward it's current mode of production in some ways; bulk FTO containers, inconsistent quality, coffee that fades rather quickly when the roaster buys it. And seriously, 80-point FTO bulk coffee is an important product to many. But for me, there is great potential here to do much more with small volumes of coffee that can achieve much better price premiums, benefit small farmers in the higher reaches of Timor-Leste, and inspire greater efforts with greater rewards. I hope as you read this, it is accompanied by some of our new Timor offerings that fulfill this promise of quality and pushing things ahead for Timor coffee. In 2016 we are starting to receive these new regional lots, and we hope to move toward even more specificity in the coffee selection going forward!   -T.O.

 Honduras coffee quality spans a huge range, from a lower-cost Central American blender coffee, to high-grown lots that rival good Guatemala coffees in acidity and flavor. The areas of Marcala, Copan and Santa Barbara, Ocotopeque and others can produce high quality coffees. And Honduras is one of the few countries with a capacity to grow their production, where as nations like Costa Rica and Panama are experiencing land pressure from other demands, and producing less and less coffee each harvest. Honduran coffees can range from bright, acidic flavor profiles, lightly fruited and with strong cane sugar sweetness, to more caramel-like, lower acidity coffees that are nice in espresso.
 For many years there was little talk of Honduran coffee in the specialty coffee market. I participated in some early cupping events, before Cup of Excellence came to this nation, and saw great potentialin cup quality but technical problems in the wet-processing of lots and in drying the coffee. While farmer education has increased greatly in Honduras, the new challenges are plant diseases like Roya, that greatly affect the small farmer who lacks resources to combat this and other fungi.
 Honduras has all the environmental factors on its side: soil, altitude, climate, and farmers who are increasingly better trained in agricultural practices. All its neighbors have sophisticated coffee production: Guatemala, El Salvador and, to some degree, Nicaragua. But what has been lacking is quality coffee processing, capital to modernize the dry mills, and a distinct "name" in the consumer market. Honduras has been known mostly as a source for commercial coffee, not specialty grade. It is still a major source for lower-priced arabica coffees headed to large roasting companies. This means that even a high quality Honduran does not always fetch a good price, and in fact many from Copan and Santa Barbara districts are smuggled into Guatemala and sold as such. Without a premium price for quality, the farmer, the mill and the exporter have no incentive to incur the added expense that would help realize the coffee's quality potential. So Honduran coffee ends up as a mild blender and not as a single-origin or farm-specific coffee. It is a vicious cycle.
 We have offered lots from the Santa Barbara and Copan areas that rival great Guatemalan coffees, as well as finding great quality in Ocotopeque and the areas in the south, near Nicaragua. A problem in Honduras is proper drying of the coffee after it is wet-processed. Some areas are wet and humid, and the coffees can be ruined when drenched by rain showers. Marcala area in the South has an advantage of a drier climate, although the coffees do not have the soaring brightness of the Northern zones.
 We started going to Honduras to look for coffee in 2003 and I was able to judge at the first Honduras Specialty Coffee Competition held in San Pedro Sula. That event was the precursor of the Cup of Excellence competitions, which have been held each year since then, and has helped to uncover high quality coffees in Honduras. My ulterior motive on this trip was to find some truly special Honduran coffees for Sweet Maria's. And I met Chris Schooley there. For our part, we are buying really good coffees and paying way over standard prices.
 Honduras, like other countries, is varied, so I can't speak about it as a single entity: coffees from Copan or Santa Barbara or El Paraiso or Ocotepeque are all different. The largest growing region is Santa Barbara, coffees are also grown in Copan, Ocotepeque, Lempira, La Paz and El Paraiso in the South. Coffee grown between 1500 and 2000 meters is given the highest designation of SHG; Strictly High Grown. The overall cup character is less acidic than other Central Americans, with distinct sweet caramel flavors in the cup.
 For more about Honduras, see my notes from that original 2003 Honduras Specialty Coffee Competition, and later my 2006 Honduras Cup of Excellence trip. I haven't done any travelogues for subsequent trips, nor have I made many visits. It's overdue, and in fact I just returned from a trip through the Southern areas of Honduras this month.

 Java  has a unique position among Indonesian coffees. It is the original  coffee planting area, with coffee coming to Batavia (Jakarta) and being  planted in the area of Bandung early in the Dutch colonial era. The  arabica coffee plant was brought to Indonesia from India in 1696. Java  coffee had a legendary status around the world until the last century.  Mocha and Java coffees commanded huge premiums, often 10x to 15x more  expensive than Brazil coffees in brokers lists from the 1920s. Aside  from history, Java is unique in that it is most often wet-processed,   resulting in a relatively clean cup, without earthy or dirty flavors  found in some lower-grade wet-hulled Indonesia coffees like Sumatra.
 As far as the flavor profile, the coffee has moderate-to-low acidity;  for a wet-processed coffee it can taste a little flat in that regard.  It also tends to lack complexity, which can make a standard Java fall  into the "blender" category more often than being spotlighted as a  single-origin brew. These standard coffees are "Government Estate" Java,  and they come from 4 old farms (Kayumas, Blawan, Djampit, Pancoer) that  date back to Dutch colonialism. These farms are in the process of  privatization, and in the past they were consistent, but rarely  outstanding coffees.
 These large farms are located in East Java in the vicinity of the  Ijen volcanic complex.  The Government body (called the PTP XXVI  Plantation) grows about 85% of the coffee in East Java, close to Bali in  the Ijen area. The range of altitudes suitable for coffee production is  3,000 to 6,000 feet with most growing in the plateau region at 4,500.  Djampit and Blawan are the largest estates, while Pancoer is 1110  Hectares, and Kayumas is 725 Hectares. Blawan is huge: 2268 Hectares.
 There is an old cultivar that can be found called Java Typica. But  there is a lot of catimor-derived cultivars such as Kartika and Ateng.  There's an older Typica type called "USDA", named after those who  developed and endorsed it. But I have found old Typica coffee plants in  the west of Java that could plausibly be from the original seedstock  that came to Java from Yemen, with a stop in India. There is also  Jember, which is named for the location of the coffee research center in  East Java.
 Most of what I see planted is Ateng type as well as some Timor  variety, which both have robusta inputs. Timor is the natural  arabica-robusta cross. The problem with Ateng is that once a farm or  farmer can grow and process a coffee well, once there is no overlay of  process flavors as you would find with wet-hull coffees, then you start  to taste the cultivar more. And in the case of Ateng, this is not a good  thing. It doesn't create outright bad coffee, as a processing defect or  a black bean does, but there is a perceptible woody note or drying  aspect in the aftertaste. For wet-hulled coffees, Ateng is fine, but for  wet-processed, it's an issue.
 We focus our efforts in Java Sunda, (West Java) although this is not  the only place with the right factors to produce good coffee on the  island. West Java was ignored as a source of quality coffee, but we find  motivated farmers there, and an interest in smaller scale,  quality-oriented coffee farming. The remaining issues are in training  farmers in quality methods, care and attention to picking only ripe  coffee cherry, and processing coffee well. The diverse farming efforts  of small growers is admirable; they are often growing market crops like  peppers, onions, beans and such. Those provide ready cash, and they look  to coffee as a kind of annual "extra" income.
 The problem with this is a lack of serious care for the coffee trees  and for pruning and mulching organic inputs to keep the soil healthy.  But the largest issues come from inter-planting coffee with other crops.  Coffee should really only be planted with nitrogen-fixing legumes; even  the shade trees should be leguminous. Other crops compete for limited  nutrients and often for water as well. Coffee is often grown organically  without pesticides or fungicides in Indonesia but the market crops are  most certainly not! Sadly, they are intensively treated with fungicides,  and the risk is that over-spraying or water contamination reaches the  coffee. Coffee Berry Borer seems to not be as intense a problem in Java  as it is in Sumatra.
 We have taken quite a few trips to Java, and continue to do so,  hoping to realize the potential of this historically important coffee  origin, and to share a mutual benefit for both the farmers, with the  increased prices we pay, and for us, a better cup of coffee to share  with our customers.

 Yemen  has a coffee culture like no other place, and the distinct flavor  profile can be partially credited to the old style of trade in the  country. Yemen is the first place coffee was commercialized, traded  through the port city of Al Mahka (Mokha). Yemeni coffee has a distinct,  rustic flavor profile which can be attributed to the fact it is all dry-processed, as well as the old seed stocks  cultivated there, and also due to the near-drought condition in which the coffee  survives. But some of the "character" of this coffee has to do with the defective grades of coffee exported from Yemen.  These defects are usually due  to poor picking and processing, delays in transporting the coffee, and  the very humid climate of the port city, Al Hudaydah (or Hodeidah), and mixing of past crop coffees with newer harvests.
 The Yemen trade is complicated. Exporters do not buy from farms, but  through an extensive network of middlemen. Local buyers receive coffee  in the pod, the entire dried cherry, which is stored, usually in  underground caverns! Most coffee that is actually exported is the oldest  of their stocks, not new crop coffee! But this is the way it has been,  and is one reason that new Yemeni arrivals often have moisture content  readings in the 10.5% range. Yemeni growers are not hurt by this system  with so many middlemen, largely because the coffee land under  cultivation is limited, production is fairly low due to high altitude  and limited inputs, and the crop is in such high demand.
 Competition  from the Saudis also keeps Yemeni coffee prices very high. We sometimes offer Yemeni Qishr now too (also spelled Quishir, Keshir, Geshir) - the  dried coffee husks used to make traditional hot infused coffee tea, or  Yemen Ginger Tea. Another local beverage of Kahwah (coffee) in Yemen is made from the entire dried coffee fruit, skin, bean and all, roasted lightly in a pan, ground all together and served. It's quite unique!
 Yemen was the original commercial coffee source, brought to Europe by Muslim  traders or their trading partners. It is also the source of most coffee  grown in the world today: Bourbon and Typica came from Yemen. In a way, Yemen has a greater claim as the origin of coffee as Ethiopia, because recorded history of coffee dates back 1200 years. Yet most agree that coffee was  not native to Yemen; it came from the highlands of Western Ethiopia  (some claim Jimma, others Kaffa). It was transported along with other  goods and slaves and was cultivated all along the way, ending up in the  Eastern Ethiopian kingdom of Harar. From there it came to Yemen where it  was grown for local consumption and to trade around Arabia, the  Mediterranean, and beyond.
 In the 19th century Mokha coffee retained  it's status as rare and valuable, even if the article sold was rarely  genuine. But in the era of maritime trade by sailing vessels, personal  "taste" was cultivated by coffee aged in the holds of the ship, as with  the legendary Old Brown Java that would leave Indonesia green and arrive  in the US the color of wood chips (and the taste of them as well). It  seems that acidic brightness in coffee was not appreciated, nor was a  clean taste, or freshness. So in that sense, Yemeni coffee is still  judged by a different yardstick than many prized wet-processed coffees  of the modern day.
 In many areas the coffee is grown on terraces with stone supporting walls, some dating back 2000 years! The only reason the soil in the terraces isn't completely depleted and can sustain coffee growth is the historical lack of intensive farming methods. With such scant water supply, most areas couldn't sustain intensive crops with high yielding output anyway, so the nutritional requirements have been in a sustainable balance with what the soil can produce. 
 Mokha (Al-Mahka) is the port city that Yemeni coffee ships from. It  has nothing to do with chocolate. Why is the coffee called Mokha?  Because in the coffee trade it was too complicated to name all the  little sub-regions where the coffee is actually grown, even though they  do produce notably different coffees in terms of the cup. Many of the  dry-process Ethiopian coffees will also call themselves Moka (Moka Harar  etc) I believe to associate themselves with the taste profile they  share with coffee from Yemen.
 Mokha is usually spelled in the trade as  "Mocca" or "Mocha" or "Moka" ...but in fact the most correct spelling is  the one you will never see: "Al-Mahka", which is the truest to the  Arabic spelling. I am trying to use it, but you will see I lapse, or in  fact want to indicate also the way I am seeing it spelled on the burlap  bag. Yemen is on the Asian continent (on the Arabian Peninsula),  although it is really just a stone's throw from Africa, across the Red  Sea and the Gulf of Aden. For coffee reasons, and since there is no  other "Arabian" coffee, we put it in the family of tastes that are North  African.
 It has been surprising that with all the turmoil in Yemen, the coffee  trade continues. I believe it is a good sign, as our trading partners  are part of a Yemeni society that seeks economic cooperation, as they  also are importers of appliances into Yemen. Promoting Yemeni products  in the world can only aid in a better understanding of common ground,  and respectful difference (We also have a great appreciation of the  cuisine, and some of our favorite restaurants are Yemeni).
 In general Yemen coffees we offer are very high-grown (although other  growing regions in the South are quite low) and need to be roasted  slightly longer than other arabica coffees. This is a dry-processed  natural coffee, and the roast color will be uneven from bean to bean.  But we judge coffee by the "cup quality", not visual appearances. "Don't  be an "eye-cupper"", my friend would always say to me. Some Yemeni  coffees are very small in screen size, which might cause problems in the  Behmor roaster.
 Yemeni coffee really develops its flavors over the first 2 days after  roasting, especially body and mouthfeel. Ideally, try to wait 24-48  hours before brewing. Since this is a hand prepared coffee dried in the  sun - watch out for rocks! There can be small stones in the coffee that  you need to cull out before roasting and definitely before grinding as  these can jam a grinder (in wet processed coffees the stones fall out in  the water channel but in dry processed coffees, small stones can escape  detection and make it all the way through to the final bag). Expect  uneven roast colors from Yemeni coffees, just as with dry-processed  Ethiopian coffees. Yemeni coffees pass from 1st crack to 2nd crack  rapidly, so be on your toes!
 I have posted a rather large travelogue from my one and only Yemen trip, and links to other articles about Yemen coffee.

 El Salvador can produce very good coffee. Bourbon varietal coffees are at one end of the spectrum, with a balanced, classic "Central" profile, a good alternative to Brazil as a base for espresso; Pacamara varietal coffees are their opposite, quirky and full of character. High altitudes and good, dense traditional varietals are a factor in the quality of El Salvador coffees. The country also produces an abundance of lower-grown coffee with fairly average cup quality.
 El Salvador coffee had a poor reputation for years, marred mostly by the inability to deliver coffee of high quality within an unstable social climate. Unfortunately, agriculture is the first to suffer in revolution and civil insecurity, since it requires years to rebuild a farm if it is neglected. In El Salvador the coffee trade, like the government in general, was controlled by a ruling elite, a handful of wealthy families that operated many farms. El Salvador had leaned toward the right politically, and the smaller coffee farmers and coffee workers fared poorly in this climate.
 But the democratic movement and decades of civil war have changed many things. It shows in the coffee quality, and the availability of small lots from good small-to-medium sized farms; we now see an eruption of farm-specific regional offerings from small farms. El Salvador always had the right ingredients ---soil, altitude, climate ---to produce coffee on par with its neighbors. Most of all, it has the cultivars: Bourbon, the classic old-world coffee and good-tasting natural hybrids of Bourbon, Pacas and Caturra.
 In the last few years, though, the growing reputation of El Salvador may have out-paced the reality. Competition for certain farms drove prices to levels that were not commensurate with the cup quality. Much El Salvador coffee is a great option for blending, especially as a base in espresso. But coffee from some of the big farms can be a bit ho-hum, and doesn't necessarily rate well next to the best coffees of its neighbors, like Guatemala. El Salvador's traditional practices in terms of selecting ripe cherry when harvesting, and traditional fermentation process have been good. But large operations don't often maintain their drying patios, dry too hot, or use poorly maintained brick surfaces that trap coffee in cracks or hold too much heat. Some traditions make for a great basis for cup quality, but others need revision.
 As with any coffee origin, there is the good and the bad. We spend time sorting through coffees to find producers who can consistently deliver quality lots. If you like, you can read about my earliest trip there, and my role as a judge in the Cup of Excellence competition. I visited some of our important coffee sources, such as Kilimanjaro farm, Finca Siberia and Finca Matalapa. All the travelogues are collected in the travelogue section of the Coffee Library .

 Kenya  is the East African powerhouse of the coffee world. Both in the cup,  and the way they run their trade, everything is topnotch. The best Kenya  coffees are not sold simply as generic AA or AB. They are specific  auction lots sold to the highest bidder, and heated competition drives  the prices sky high. Their research and development is unparalleled.  Their quality control is meticulous, and many thousands of small farmers  are highly educated in their agricultural practice --and rewarded --  for top level coffee.
 In general, this is a bright coffee that lights up the palate from  front to back. It is not for people who do not like acidity in coffee  (acidity being the prized bright notes in the cup due to an interrelated  set of chlorogenic acids). A great Kenya is complex, and has  interesting fruit (berry, citrus) flavors, sometimes alternating with  spice. Some are clean and bright, others have cherished winey flavors.
 I am really proud of our consistently excellent selection of Kenyas!  It takes a lot of work to sort through the many samples we receive in  order to find the few that are truly complex. These are the coffees that  truly stand out, not just making a pleasant cup, but providing a real  "experience". When we go after an auction lot, 9 out of 10 times we buy  the whole thing; it is exclusively ours. While it is possible that the  same farm or co-op has more than one auction lot (for example, early and  late harvest lots from the same season) I can say with certainty that  we have cupped all the lots and chosen the best one. It's just a matter  of effort and hard work, and when it comes to cupping Kenyas, we put a  focused and intensive effort into the auctions during the main crop  season.
 Currently, the excellent Kenya auction system and coffee production  in general is suffering a myriad problems, as is all of East Africa.  Politically, Kenya, the former model of progress and African  Independence, is in disarray. For now, the coffees are still of high  quality but if the auction system does not continue to serve and benefit  the small farmer co-ops, they will plant other crops instead, or  replace the better cultivars (the excellent SL-28 and SL-34 selections)  with the disease resistant, but poor quality, Ruiri 11 strain.
 I was in Kenya, visiting farms, as well as the Nairobi auction house  and the cupping rooms of a big coffee exporter. The entire auction  operation is amazingly impressive - over 600 separate lots that are  sampled and bid each week! Be sure to look for my travel commentary from  my recent Kenya trip, plus a couple hundred new images. There are great  pictures of the coffee auction house, where nearly all Kenyan coffees  that reach the market are traded. I also went back later that season,  and have visited every year since, so check out our travelogues.
 There have been many political controversies in Kenya lately, with  localities taking control of the coffee sector. In 2013/14 this occurred  in Nyeri area, as the politicians became involved in how coffee was  going to be marketed, and limited the transport of coffee as a way to  control where it was sold. While it was done "for the farmers" there  have been many questions since about the net gain the new strategy  yielded on behalf of those it was supposed to help. Still, it  underscores that the system is in need of greater transparency at all  levels.
 On a historical note: coffee was introduced into Kenya by way of  Reunion (Bourbon) island at the end of the 19th century (1893 is  sometimes given as the date). It was brought for local cultivation by  the Fathers of the Holy Spirit congregation in 1911 - another case of  the long and twisted road that religion and coffee have traveled  together.
 Some facts ...Harvest Times - Main Crop: October-December,  Fly Crop:  June-August; Cultivars in Kenya: SL-28, SL-34, Bourbon, Kents, Typica,  Riuri 11. Bourbons are sometimes called "Scottish Mission" and "French  Mission".

 Coffee from the Indonesian island of Bali was formerly sold exclusively to the Japanese market. Perhaps it is the changing face of world economics that finds the first exports of Balinese coffee arriving in the United States. Based on how widely it is offered, it is still not clear how an island with very limited coffee areas produces so much coffee...in other words, it's not all from Bali. Also, there is very little coffee grown here at respectable altitudes, and at lower than 1250 meters tends to taste very low grown in the cup.
 But sometimes Bali coffees can be sophisticated and well-prepared. They are washed (wet-processed) like neighboring coffees from Java, East Timor and Papua New Guinea. The cup has traces of the earthy Indonesian island character, but only in the background. It is a classic, clean cup, with great body and mildness.
 Some background: In terms of island history, the colonial phase came late for Bali. Though the Dutch were there back in the 1850's, an important event in the of history of Bali is the landing of Dutch troops at Sanur beach in the year 1900.  This led to the complete conquering of the island by the Dutch and the defeat and ritual suicide of some of the most prominent princely families. After the Japanese occupation during the Second World War from 1939 to 1945, Bali became a province of Indonesia, but managed to maintain a separate, specifically Balinese culture. For instance, the dominant religion in most parts of Indonesia is Islam, whereas in Bali it is Hinduism.
 Geographically Bali is dominated by a number of volcanic mountains in the center of the island. The most active one of them is Gunung Agung whose violent eruption in 1963 killed a large number of people and caused a lot of devastation in the eastern areas. The island is ringed by coral reefs; the beaches in the south have white sand, the beaches in the east and north have black (volcanic) sand. Bali has a population of around 3 million. The predominant form of agriculture is wet-rice cultivation, but there are also large fruit plantations in the east of Bali, as well as corn fields and coffee plantations.
 The majority of the population is still made up of farmers, but tourism and associated businesses (such as manufacture and sales of souvenirs, etc.) are becoming more and more important. You should know that the economic circumstances and the standard of living for the majority of the Balinese population are quite modest, and that a lot of people are, even by Indonesian standards, actually very poor.
 Coffee  from Panama was once overlooked and under-rated, but not any  longer. That perception was changed, in part by the Best  of Panama competition which attracting global competition for  the best lots and garnering spectacular prices. The Gesha cultivar from some small estate, with its floral top notes, has also lavished heaps of  attention in general on Panama coffee production.
 Panama coffees from higher altitudes are brightly toned, with clean  fruited notes and sometimes floral aromatics. Lesser Panama coffees are  quite different, and had been a staple of higher-end commercial roasters and  lower-end specialty roasters. Ineed there are still many lower-grown Panamas but in all parts of the country, an influx of land investment has lessened the acreage planted in coffee.
 Generally the better coffees come from the Boquete and Volcan coffees from the Chirqui district, ones  from small family-owned farms that produce the unique  coffees. They employ N'gobe Indians for the picking season, who will  come to the coffee farms to work under some of the better wage standards  and labor laws in Central America, I'm told.
 Panama has changed greatly in recent years, particularly the coffee  producing areas. As investment money came in and the expat/retiree population  boomed, it affected the coffee sector in several ways. Farms were sold  to foreign investors from Colombia, Venezuela and North America. Land  values skyrocketed as retirees from the US sought the lower cost of  living, warmer climate and the beauty of the Chirqui area. Conveniences  abounded: big box stores nearby in the town of David, the prospect of  having a fancy home with a maid and a gardener, and fixed incomes  covering medical care to a greater extent, with top doctors in Panama  City.
 It is no longer the place I visited over a decade ago, and the  pressure on labor and land values have made coffee farming even more  difficult. And somehow producing good, clean, wet-processed coffee was  not enough. Farmers chasing the "Gesha rainbow" have tried all kinds of  varietals and processes to attract more attention to their coffee, and  they look for prices of 5-20 times that of a solid wet-processed coffee.
 In this spasm of competition and diverging ideas of what a "good"  coffee is, I think there has been some tarnishing of the Panama star.  But great coffee continues to be produced there by some of the most  knowledgeable farmers in Central America. Many have the advantage of  strong US contacts, family in the States, US university education and  flawless English. One wishes they could share their knowledge with other  coffee farmers in Central America who lack these advantages.
 For some rather dated background material on Panama coffees, go can way back to the 2002 Panama Cupping Competition; also  see my slide show of the 2003 cupping. We have a page about the #1 2004  coffee, Jaramillo Especial, and a page about the 2004 Cupping. And the  January 2006 crop visit to check our small lot coffee and visit the  Gesha trees at Hacienda La Esmeralda. Also see my April 2006 Best of  Panama competition trip.

 Rwanda has one of the most interesting East African coffee histories. It is a place where the production of high-quality coffee is inextricably linked to the rising spirit of a population after the tragic genocidal civil war of the 1990s. Known as the "Land of a Thousand Hills," many of them are cultivated in high-grown coffee between 1700 and 2000 meters above sea level (MASL). Rwanda coffee can be world class.  They often have clean bright flavors rivaling the best Central America coffees, more balance than Kenyas, attractive fruited sweetness, floral characteristics, and with a tea-like finish.
 
It is believed that coffee was introduced in Rwanda in 1904 by German missionaries. Around 1930, a considerable interest in coffee developed as it was the sole revenue-generating commodity for rural families. Not long ago, Rwandan coffee was rarely seen in the United States at all. The strong relationship with Belgium (the former colonizer of the country) made it a near exclusive buyer for the low-grade commercial coffee produced in Rwanda, as well as a lone trader from London. 
 
Coffee is grown in many sectors, but most coffee comes from the South and Western districts. Many farms are perched at altitudes ranging from 1700 - 2000 MASL. Coffee is grown all along Lake Kivu, from the northern area of Gisenyi to the central areas of Kibuye and Nyamasheke, down to Cyangugu. In the South there is a lot of production in the vicinity of Butare. The North has more limited coffee growing, with much in Rulindo district north of the capital Kigali. And the East produces a decent amount of volume too, but much of it is grown at lower altitudes of around 1300 meters.
 
The government encouraged (actually, they mandated)  high-volume, crudely-processed coffee production. Even with this low grade coffee production, coffee played a considerable role in the economic development of the country because it was one of the few cash crops. But with the collapse of world coffee prices at the international market level, the push to export low-grade arabica made less and less sense. Historically, Rwanda had been the 9th largest producer of arabica in Africa, with 500,000 small farms averaging less than 1 hectare each. Farms have usually not been measured in land area: being so small, they were measured in number of trees. The average is 165 trees per farmer, miniscule compared to other nations!  The season in Rwanda harvest is roughly March - July, with arrivals in the US between June - September.
 
Rwanda coffee was traditionally processed by each small producer, and there was only one true wet-process coffee mill (called a washing station here) in the country. This home-processed coffee still accounts for the majority of production, and is called "ordinary" or "semi-washed" since most of it doesn't have complete fermentation to remove all the fruit mucilage from the parchment layer of coffee. It is estimated that 60 to 70% of current production goes into semi-washed blends. This type of processing isn't inherently bad, but when you mix it all together, well-processed batches with poorly-picked and processed ones result in the lowest common denominator for cup quality. As I ask producers - "what happens when you mix a glass of clean spring water with a glass of muddy river water? Two bad glasses of water"!
 
This type of low-grade production never returned much to the farmers, but there was so little export production of any kind from Rwanda, it had an outsized significance to the country and to the individual coffee producer.
 
Then the genocide occurred, and how any society returns to a "normal" life after the tragedy of monumental scale is difficult to imagine. But the recovery in Rwanda has occurred with an unflinching openness to the genocide. (A personal thought: I think much of the world stood by because awareness of Rwanda was low, and self-interest in Rwanda was low. What did Rwanda produce and export that the world cared about? Clinton said so much at the time, and in retrospect regretted it as did other world leaders on whose watch the massacre happened. I feel that interest in Rwanda, awareness of their products and the people, would make another tragedy difficult to ignore, and coffee is a "gateway to the world" in that sense.)
 
After the genocide, as the floodgates opened for assistance to the Rwandan population, revitalizing coffee production was made an important goal. To do this, organizations like the PEARL project and SPREAD standardized and trained farmers and new cooperative washing stations in traditional techniques of coffee production based on other East African countries. Burundi in particular offered a good model for production.
 From the farm through to the washing station, coffee production in Rwanda is quite ideal for a small-holder farmer type system. The original ways of planting and pruning the tree are well done, with the already-mentioned varietal selection (Bourbons-types, generally), plant spacing, mulching for water-retention, organic material input and weed control, light shading of coffee with trees, and Kenya-type pruning techniques. The government (via their coffee board NAEB) distributes fertilizer to farmers at the wet mills.  Bourbon types grown in Rwanda include these attractively named plants: POP3303/21; Jackson 2/1257; BM 139.
 
After the coffee is picked, the cherries are often floated in water to remove light beans. Pulping is often done with Kenya-type disc depulpers than include a grader for light and heavy beans. The light beans are taken out and go to a secondary huller and a separate low-grade fermentation tank, for B and C grade coffees. The heavy dense beans go to the fermentation tank for A grade beans, and these are eventually designated as A1, A2 and A3 qualities.
 
One of the best things in Rwanda processing is the fact that all the coffee goes to the "skin-drying tables". These are raised shaded beds where the wet parchment coffee is picked over to remove defects that are especially apparent in the still-wet parchment. In particular, the workers remove Antestia affected coffee, under-ripe beans, pulper-nicked coffee, fruit skins, or beans where the parchment was mistakenly removed and ffected by the ferment water in the tanks. (Remember, the purpose of fermenting coffee is not to affect flavor. It is to break down the fruit mucilage that clings to the parchment layer surrounding the bean. This skin keeps the ferment process, and broken-down mucilage fruit, away from the green bean. If a green bean comes into contact with the sticky ferment water, it will taste like ferment (think rotting fruit) and ruin the cup quality.)
 
This skin-drying phase not only allows an extra chance to remove defects, it slows down the initial drying of the parchment, which I feel increases cup quality. The coffee then goes out the the raised drying tables, where it takes 15-20 days (ideally) to reach a moisture level of 11% or so. In the heat of the day, the workers cover the coffee to prevent too-rapid drying under direct sun. The result with the best Rwanda coffee is a totally white-colored parchment coffee with no cracks from rapid drying. Why is this good for quality? Because this tiny parchment "shell", facilitates a safe drying environment, buffering it from the outside. It allows a slow and even loss of moisture, which results in less loss of organic compounds (good for cup flavor), and ultimately a green coffee that can be stored longer without degrading.
 
One of the challenges in Rwanda is the poor organic material content in the soil. Every small patch of land is cultivated in this country, and has been for many decades. The soil is depleted, and there isn't enough sources for new organic material to add back. Some level of chemical fertilization is needed, as well as returning every possible type of compost to the ground. The NGOs brought the California Red Worm here to introduce vermiculture as a source for improved compost, especially to break down the coffee pulp (the skin and outer layer of the fruit) created during processing.
 
Another great challenge is the dreaded "potato defect," so named because it smells like an old, sprouted potato in the cup. The problem is specific to the East African lake areas of Kivu, also found in Burundi and Congo coffees. This off-flavor is caused by a bacterial agent that enters the cherry skin and produces a pyrazine chemical toxin that binds to the forming green beans. The bacterial transmission is often brought into the fruit by the Antestia bug, a type of coffee berry borer insect that is attracted to sugars in the coffee fruit. But anything that pierces the cherry wall can allow the bacteria to enter and eventually release the the nasty pyrazine. Removing the affected beans is necessary to keep from getting a "potato" cup, but at this time,  there is no mechanical way to identify them. The result is that, even with top coffees, an occasional cup will have this potato taste. It's tragic, given how good the coffee can be.
 
Another issue that is often overlooked is the business of the washing station. In years where the coffee market is high, there is usually a rush of investors building washing stations and buying coffee cherry, often without forethought as to how they will finance their purchases, sell the coffee (so they often overpay for cherry thinking there is a big payout on the other side), and the important relation between quality and price. Additionally, cooperatives can be poorly-managed, and in fact are often not "cooperatives" as we imagine them to be. They might be a group of some larger local farmers and a few people from Kigali, the capital, who have never farmed coffee in their lives. There might be 10 "coop members", but the farmers they buy cherry from are not actually members of the coop, nor allowed to be. With both these less-than-ideal scenarios, the problem for the farmer is that the market for their coffee cherries is not reliable. One year the station might operate, the next year it doesn't. They always have the option to process themselves and sell it as semi-washed, but the price is much lower.
 
For our part we have tried to seek out private and coop stations that are serious about the coffee business.  They need to understand it well, be from the area, and want to return something beneficial to the farmers they buy from. Some of our sources were supported by a good program run by the Technoserve NGO in Rwanda, and now receive support from the service providers born out of that effort.
 
Each year we make a few trips to Rwanda during the coffee season and have participated in the early competitions here, including the first-ever Rwanda Cup of Excellence competition in 2008, and again in the 2010.

 Tom just got back from a long trip to Rwanda and Burundi. Here's a few Instagrams he posted during his travels.
 This is a very welcome sight after some long and late flights.

 Sometimes tasting something that isn't coffee can help you learn more about what your coffee tastes like. If you think about it, brewed coffee has such a huge range of tastes and flavors that are affected by origin, processing, storage, roasting, brewing, etc. so it can be fun to break down what we experience in every cup. Communicating those flavors can be challenging since we all might have different ideas of what "chocolate", "citrus" or "fruited" tastes like. The same goes for "sugar". There are so many different sugars that taste different from one another. We thought it would be interesting to taste few side by side so we diluted a bunch of them in water and took some time to taste their sugary differences.
 Construction on our new location is coming along and we expect to move in sometime early this summer. Concrete flooring is in. Walls are in (mostly) and we are enjoying how expansive the warehouse space looks for now. Once we move in our storage racks and thousands of pounds of coffee it won't feel as spacious.
 Did your favorite coffee go out of stock last month? It might be on this list of coffees that we recently ran out of. Check out our suggestions for replacements that we think you will enjoy. This a great opportunity to try new  coffees with similar  flavors and characteristics.

 Coffee has a long history in Ecuador. It was introduced in the early 19th century and became its main export in the early 20th century. But coffee from Ecuador has never been included in the list of top quality coffee origins, mostly because of poor harvesting and processing practices.
 Like other nearby coffee-growing nations, Ecuador has ideal altitudes and climate for coffee, and a lot of old heirloom Typica variety trees. A great Ecuador coffee is balanced, bright, and has a clean taste overall. Ecuador has moderate body, and can feature floral notes on rare occasions. Like its neighbors, Ecuador is harvested counter to the Central America crop, so it arrives in the US at an ideal time to replace Centrals that might be getting tired in the cup.
 But coffee has taken a back seat in Ecuador. As other Ecuadorian exports (bananas, oil, shrimp) exceeded coffee in importance, hope that the quality of the coffee would improve dimmed. They managed to continue to ship low grade arabica and robusta coffees, finding a market among the institutional and commercial roasters of the U.S. and Europe who are more concerned with price than cup quality. Low grade arabicas are dry-processed in Ecuador, called "bola," and have a hard, earthy flavor. I found that some supermarket roasted/ground coffees like Pilon and Bustelo use a lot of Ecuador bola coffee. But coffee formerly employed about 15% of the rural population.
 As I mentioned, Ecuador has everything it takes to grow great coffee. Positioned between Colombia and Peru, the interior mountain ranges have plenty of altitude, good weather patterns, and ideal soil for coffee. But a great coffee can be ruined at any stage in the process, from the tree to the cup. Many of the problems are with a lack of adherence to quality standards in the wet-processing, drying, resting (reposo) and then dry-milling of the coffee. A bit too much fermentation in the wet mill tanks, a rain storm drenching the coffee when it is on the drying patios, moist low-altitude conditions during the reposo, or badly adjusted dry-mill equipment can all ruin a wonderful coffee.
 Poor infrastructure, delays in shipment, tainted shipping containers ... there is one way to produce good coffee and a thousand ways to ruin it! So the new efforts by the Ecuadorian Agriculture Department and farmer Co-operatives focus on education, improved equipment, and adherence to high standards.
I did travel to Ecuador a while back, and we take at least 2 trips a year since then. Check out the travelogue section of our Coffee Library page for the photos.

 On a cupping table of well-processed Central American coffees, a  Sumatra would immediately be thrown out. The earthy and foresty flavors -  herbal, sometimes mossy or even mushroomy - would be attributed to  processing errors, and the coffee labeled defective. So why this schism  in the way the coffee trade treats wet-hull Indonesia coffees, and  Sumatra in particular?
 It comes down to taste: If a Sumatra supplier can consistently  provide the same coffee, processed the same way, be it fruity or earthy,  there are buyers who see this as a uniquely different flavor profile,  and a welcome break from the Central America, Colombia or Kenya coffees.  And of course the bottom line is that their customers like it. Those  who like minimally-processed wines, or those wines with complex flavors  of leather, peat moss, fir, cedar, humus, tannins, will see something in  the Sumatra flavor profile.
 Indonesian coffees like Sumatra are nearly always processed by the  wet-hull method. Wet-hulled coffee is called Giling Basah in Bahasa  language. Most coffee in Indonesia is grown on small-holder farms, a  family with anywhere between 100 trees to a few hectares of land. They  pick the coffee and pulp it, which means that they run it through a  hand-crank drum with a surface like a cheese grater that peels off the  skin of the fruit. Then they will ferment the coffee in any number of  ways - either in a polypropylene bag, a plastic tub, or a concrete tank -  to get the fruit layer (mucilage) to break down. After overnight  fermentation, the mucilage can be washed off, and you have wet parchment  coffee - the green bean inside the parchment layer that encompasses it,  still swollen with water.
 Sometimes origins like Sumatra are available as a true wet-processed  coffee (although this term would probably not apply well, a better  description would be dry-hulled).  In wet-processing a farm would slowly  dry this coffee for days or weeks, usually on a patio or raised bed, or  sometimes in a mechanical dryer, down to 10-11.5 % moisture. In this  process, the green bean would become the small dried seed we know, and  the thin parchment shell is removed, preparing the coffee for export.
 But in Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia, the farmer doesn't want  to wait for all this to happen - they want to get paid! They want to do  as little work to process the coffee, and get cash. And who can blame  them? So they take their clean wet parchment coffee, dry it a few hours  until it has 50% moisture content, and sell it to a collector middleman,  or deliver it to a mill. They get paid faster, and do less work this  way.
 The mill might dry the coffee a little bit more, a day or two, but in  general they send it to a special machine (the wet-huller) when the  coffee still has 25-35% moisture content. This machine uses a lot of  friction to take the tightly-attached parchment layer and tear it from  the water-swollen green bean, which at this stage is often white and  looks nothing like the green bean we finally see. Then the coffee is  laid out to dry, totally unprotected by any outer layer, on a patio, on a  tarp, on the road, or sometimes on the dirt! Drying without the shell  is rapid, so the mill is able to sell the coffee and get paid with  rapidity.
 What does this do to the coffee? It creates a lower-acid cup, less  brightness, and seems to enhance body. But the risk is great: the wet  and unprotected green bean can easily be damaged in the hulling, or on  the drying patio. No farmer in Central America would think of exposing  their green bean direct to the patio or bed without the parchment layer.  This layer protects the coffee from taints, keeps it clean, and allows a  slower, gentler, more uniform drying. And coffees that are dried well  will last longer when they arrive at the buyers; good tastes won't fade  quickly into papery or burlap bag flavors.

 This might make is sound like all wet-hulled coffee is bad, since  this method isn't rooted in creating good-tasting coffee, but rather  speeding up the process. But there is good vs. bad wet-hulled coffee.  There are mills drying coffee on patios so clean you could eat off them,  covered in a green-house like structure to protect from the  unpredictable Sumatra rains, treating the coffee with great respect, and  consistently producing great lots. It takes a lot of cupping, and  identifying a different set of reference points to determine what a  really good wet-hull Sumatra should be.
 We look for sweetness in the cup, an expanded definition of sweetness  than one might use when cupping other origins. This could be raw sugar,  like muscavado, or molasses. It could be unique syrups like brown rice  syrup, or sorghum syrup. In any case, a coffee with no sweetness is  rarely, if ever a good coffee. We look at the rustic elements to  distinguish gross flavors like dirt from positive clean-earth, humus or  other positive and relatively clean natural scents and tastes. While  slight green herb and mossy is good, vegetal notes that are too  bittering hint at poor processing or under-ripe fruits. In our lab we  also check the defect count, ultra-violet appearance of the coffee,  water activity, humidity and density of the bean. These tell the story  of the coffee, but ultimately we find that cupping reveals the truth  just as well.
 Sumatra was planted in coffee after the crop was introduced to Java  in Indonesia. Arabica production in Sumatra began in the 18th century  under Dutch colonial domination, introduced first to the northern region  of Aceh around Lake Tawar. Coffee is still widely produced in these  northern regions of Aceh (Takengon, Bener Mariah) as well as in the Lake  Toba region (Lintong Nihuta, Dairi-Sidikalang, Siborongborong, Dolok  Sanggul, and Seribu Dolok) to the southwest of Medan.
 In the past, Sumatra coffees have not been sold by region, because  presumably the regional differences are not that distinct. Rather, the  quality of the picking, preparation and processing of the coffee  determines much of the cup character in this coffee. In fact, Sumatras  are sold as Mandheling (Mandailing) which is simply the Indonesian  ethnic group that was once involved in coffee production. The coffee is  scored by defects in the cup, not physical defects of the green coffee.  So a fairly ugly-looking green coffee can technically be called Grade 1  Mandheling. A grade 1 coffee can be a good cup or a very dirty and  ugly-tasting coffee. The grading sometimes seems arbitrary by any  standard. The way coffee is shipped via the humid port of Medan also  damages quality as it can gain moisture before shipping, then flash  dried in the hot, hot sun to get it back down to an acceptable level.  This ruins cup quality.
 The main story behind the coffee here is processing, but the  varieties of coffee grown do factor into the cup, and certainly into the  farming practice. Sumatra has a range of cultivars. The original Typica  type was brought from Yemen or Ethiopia via India. This is sometimes  called Jember Typica. There are 2 main Typica types: Bergandal and  Sidikalang. Hibrido de Timor, a cross between arabica and robusta, is  sometimes found with the name "TimTim" ... we offered TimTim Blangili a  while back. The majority of coffees are arabica types that have robusta  inputs, like the Catimor coffees found in Central America. Ethiopia  strains were reintroduced with the names Rambung and Abyssinia, which  were brought to Java in 1928, and later to Aceh, Sumatra. Another group  of Ethiopian varieties found in Sumatra are called “USDA". Knowing the  specific cultivar is nearly impossible, and they are often a mix of  many. In Sulawesi for example, Djember means S-795 from India, not a  pure Typica. Many Aceh coffees are Ateng types of catimor, although  there is still old varieties of coffee tucked away in this zone. Our  Lintongs are a mix of Onan Ganjang, Djembers, and Ateng types. All of  this is really second fiddle to the process flavors, the Indonesia  wet-hull method called Giling Basah. Process flavors trump all in the  Sumatra cup.
 Sumatra faces many problems in coffee cultivation. There are types of  fungus such as leaf rust. But the most damage to the crop and the  livelihood of the small farmer is CBB - the Coffee Berry Borer - or  Broca, as it is called in Latin America. Broca runs rampant in most  areas of Sumatra. The small beetle drills into the fruit and seed while  it is on the tree, and these beans must be sorted out from top grade  coffees before they are exported. It is forced from the bean in  processing, so the insect itself is not a risk but the damage it does to  the bean and the plant's reaction to the attack will result in a whole  host of defect flavors in the cup.
 On my last trip to Sumatra I was shocked at the amount of Broca I saw  on the plant, and also on the wet parchment coffee. They were all over  the bags in the local markets where coffee is traded. It was very sad  both for the damage to the cup quality, as well as the value and volume  of the crop. There are natural control methods, like alcohol traps made  from used 2 liter soda bottles. But one of the best prevention methods  is to pick coffee promptly when it is mature, and not let coffee fall to  the ground. The borer only wants to live in the ripe fruit. But Sumatra  has a poorly defined crop cycle and weather patterns, meaning the  coffee shrub often has ripe fruit on it. It's like a Broca motel - the  borer always find a room available.
 There is a tendency to over-roast Indonesians. The reason is that  they don't show as much roast color, and have a mottled appearance up  until 2nd crack and even a bit into it. Don't let this make you think  you have to roast them dark (although they can be nice this way too).  Great Indonesians will be wonderful roasted just to the verge of 2nd  crack but NOT into it at all. So ignore the weird beans you see green,  and ignore the mottled appearance of lighter roasts, and only focus on  the what you get in the cup.
 With prices high, you expect quality would be up too. But in general  this is not the case. What's the incentive to pick and prepare coffee  better when the market guarantees a premium anyway? It's why we buy very  selectively from Sumatra and cup our lots hard. What I have seen is  blends of old crop and new crop early in the Grade 1 window (Nov-Jan in  particular), which is a deceptive practice. Nonetheless, roasters need  Sumatra and I am sure someone buys it ... someone who doesn't cup their  lots that is! Problems aside, we have been able to find great Sumatras  in both the traditional rustic flavor category, and cleaner,  well-processed types, because we have established good relations  directly with the sources.
 
Sweet Maria's offers a few pre-blended coffees for use as espresso and dark roast. There are pros and cons to blending. We feel strongly that good coffee does not need to be blended; we want to discover the "origin taste" in the cup, the singular essence of the place the coffee is from. This is lost in blending. However, there are reasons to blend. Here are some excerpts from our Blending Article.
 Our blends are made with our best coffees. We don't treat blends as a way to get rid of older coffees or ones we need to clear out! In many cases, our blend components are sourced just for the blend, based on test roasts and cupping. They are all comprised of coffees on our green coffee offering list.
 While some roasters use blends as a way to reduce costs, to promote their name and enforce customer loyalty, let me also add that many good small roasters are like us; they are proud of their single farm, single origin offerings and they are proud of their blends! They too use great coffee in their blends. Whether a roaster adheres to the pre-roast or post-roast blend school, the cup cannot achieve excellence if average quality coffees are used.
 Our blends are divided into Standards (blends we maintain throughout the year, like our Espresso Monkey Blend, and Espresso Workshop "editions." "Espresso Workshop?" The latter are blends that are only offered for as long as we have the specific lots of coffee we used to design the blend, and then it's gone. When we maintain an Espresso Standard blend, like Espresso Monkey Blend, we have to find new lots to maintain the flavors of the blend as the coffee crops change. That can be a tough job, to optimize the blend and, at the same time, to maintain the "spirit of the blend" ... its original intent. There will be shifts in the blend, inevitably. In a sense, Workshop Espresso editions are pure and uncompromising: specific coffees are found that inspire testing, and a new blend idea is born. Instead of maintaining the blend and making ingredient substitutions down the line, the Workshop editions follow the crop cycle of the coffee.
 
Coffees from different origins are blended together for several reasons. Presumably the goal is to make a coffee that is higher in cup quality than any of the ingredients individually. But high quality arabica coffee should be able to stand alone; it should have good clean flavor, good aromatics, body and aftertaste. So one reason coffees are blended in the commercial world might be the use of lower-quality coffee in the blend. Another reason might be to create a proprietary or signature blend that leads consumers to equate a particular coffee profile with a particular brand image. Consumers don't often call Starbucks by the origin names used in the coffee but simply as "a cup of Starbucks" as if the dark carbony roast tastes were somehow exclusive to that brand. Coffees are also blended to maintain consistency from crop year to year. This is done with major brands that do not want to be dependent on any specific origin flavor so they can source coffee from the least expensive sources. Such blends generally reduce all the coffees included to the lowest common denominator. But let's put aside the less-than-noble reasons that coffee is blended and focus on details that concern the quality-oriented roaster. Before blending any high-quality coffees you should know the flavors of the individual coffees and have some goal for an ideal cup that cannot be attained by a single origin or single degree of roast. It would be a shame to blend a fantastic Estate coffee; after all, you are supposedly trying to attain a cup that exceeds the components and it's not likely you can do this with top coffees. Given that you have both a reason to a blend and a logical process for doing it, there will be little need for more than around 5 coffees in the blend. Blends with more than 5 coffees are considered to be fanciful, or indulgent, or confused by more than a few expert coffee tradespeople I know.
 
While blending requires the expert skill of knowing each ingredient coffee, having a clear cup profile as the goal in mind, and knowing how to achieve it, blends should not be considered a "higher" form of coffee by any standard. As indicated above, the opposite case is often true. For me personally there is much more satisfaction in enjoying single-origin and estate coffees roasted to their peak of flavor. In my opinion, even a so-so single-farm coffee is more intriguing than a blended cup, even if the blend is admittedly superior! Why? Because when I taste an unblended coffee it is the end result of a long road from crop to cup, without any one person deciding what I will be experiencing. While I enjoy that cup, I like to think about that process, and it informs my opinion about that region or that specific farm. I enjoy feeling connected to the origin of the coffee and the process in this way.
 
I get a lot of questions about blending before or after roasting ...which is better? If you have an established blend it certainly is easier to blend the coffee green and roast it together. If you are experimenting with blend ingredients and percentages you will want to roast each separately so you can experiment with variations without having to make a new roast with each change. The case for roasting coffees individually is strong with the Melange-type blend, and with a handful of particular coffees, such as Robusta in espresso blends. Some coffees are more dense or have extreme size variations. These will roast differently than standard wet-processed arabicas. All dry-processed arabicas require roasting to a slightly higher degree of temperature. But in most cases the coffees can be roasted together and I would recommend this: roast the coffee together until you encounter a situation where the results are disappointing and for success you must roast them separately. Every coffee roasts a bit differently but there is a great deal of averaging that occurs between coffees in the roast chamber, especially in drum roast systems. And then there's the coffees that do not roast evenly as single origins either: Yemeni, Ethiopian DP coffees, etc. Uneven roast color is not a defect, and only when it occurs in a wet-processed arabica that should roast to an even color (and sometimes not even in this case) is it of any consequence.Please see the reviews of the blends below. We tend not to rate some blends with cupping scores,
 especially with espresso. Espresso must be cupped as espresso and standard terms are undeveloped at this time.
 We  currently have no coffee from Puerto Rico to offer, since none has  passed muster on the cupping table. Sadly we can't see this changing in  the near future, but since we have offered Puerto Rico coffee in the  past, we want to share our experience with it. Puerto Rico has been a  tough coffee origin in recent years. With increased awareness about the  effect of low altitude production on coffee, the need for a lot of human  labor to hand pick and sort coffee to create truly great lots, and  changing weather patterns...well, everything is stacked against Puerto  Rico.
 They don't have the access to labor, they don't have the altitude,  the picking and preparation have been poor, and all of this shows in the  cup. When it was good, to describe the flavor it is best to think about  the general term "island profile." These coffees, which include Jamaica  and Kona, have a soft cup, not acidic, balanced, and mild. They are  approachable coffees and all happen to be quite expensive. Be aware of  the fact that higher priced coffees don't necessarily have a "better"  cup, but rather that price is determined by the cost of production, and  limited availability. Remember that this is a coffee grown in the U.S.  so production costs are higher. We would love to support coffee  production in PR because it is from the US, but can't do it solely  because of that factor, and particularly because we find it does not  pass our minimum expectations on the cupping table.
 As you can see in the image here, the selection of coffee cherry can  be quite poor. To produce clean and defect-free coffee flavors in the  cup, one of the requirements is selection of ripe coffee cherry only.  Green unripe cherries make for astringent and harsh flavors in the cup,  while over-ripe produce fermenty wine-to-vinegar notes.
 Here is some more background from literature of the well-known Yauco Selecto coffee brand:
"Puerto Rico has a well developed coffee tradition. The history of  coffee is closely tied to the history of this Caribbean island. First  brought in 1736, the Spanish immigrants who settled on the island  relegated coffee to a secondary role for the most part of the 18th  century. At the time, the fertile valleys were their main concern and  sugar and the crops were the order of the day. During the early part of  the 19th century, events in Europe forced a migration of residents from  the French Mediterranean island of Corsica. They arrived to Puerto Rico  and were quickly told that if they wanted to farm, they would have to go  to the highlands for all the valleys were taken by the Spanish  immigrants. They settled in the Southwestern Mountains of the island,  mostly around a town called Yauco. Hard work and determination was  rewarded when they brought forth the idea of growing coffee in these  high mountains. By the 1860s they dominated the coffee industry on the  island. Two devastating hurricanes hit Puerto Rico during 1898. The  hurricanes destroyed the coffee industry. Farmers needed to wait two  years to begin seeing the crop return to its normal level. During this  time, it was evident that the United States was interested in Puerto  Rico (along with Cuba and the Philippines) for its sugar production.  Tariffs gave coffee in Puerto Rico a severe blow as European nations no  longer allowed our coffee to come in as a colonial product. The United  States had a long standing agreement to buy the bulk of its coffee from  Brazil."

 Zimbabwe coffee is often overshadowed by other East African origins, namely the bright and powerful coffees of Kenya. Yet they are quite different in terms of flavor profile and balance. We have often had difficulty finding Zimbabwe coffee that has a clean cup character, hence the drought in offering it at SM. Some of the intrinsic cup flavors border on wild or even unclean. Whether it is from the terroir or the cultivars used, Zimbabwe coffees can have earthy chocolate and leather flavors that (in moderation) are pleasant but in excess give an off impression in the finish. But an ideal Zimbabwe can have excellent acidity accenting complex roasty notes, almost savory in character; a deep brooding character overall.
 Zimbabwe, formerly known as lower Rhodesia until independence in 1980, has produced coffee commercially since the 1960s. The total area of the country is 150,873 square miles. Zimbabwe occupies part of the great plateau of southern Africa. The most prominent physical feature is a broad ridge that runs southwest to northeast across the country. It has an elevation of between 4000 and 5000 feet and is known as the High Veld. The land of Zimbabwe is primarily covered with savanna; a particularly lush grass that grows during the moist summers. Forests are found only in limited areas along the eastern border and in the wettest areas of the High Veld. Wildlife includes elephants, hippopotamuses, lions, crocodiles, impalas, giraffes, and baboons.
 Coffee production is chiefly from the Manicaland and Mashonaland provinces along the border of Mozambique. Coffee production towns are Chipinge (also spelled Chapina) and Mutare. Top AA quality coffee is often marked "Code 53" on the bags, an enigmatic and perhaps arbitrary internal designation for best quality. The power-grabbing by Mugabe and suppression of democratic media in Zimbabwe has been very troubling. Once a model of modern progress, it has resembled a dystopian nightmare at times.
 The principal Zimbabwean cash crop is not coffee, it is tobacco, which is grown mainly in the northern and central regions. Other cash crops include cotton, maize, sugarcane, and coffee. Economic sanctions were responsible for curtailing the export of tobacco in the 1970s, and since then emphasis has shifted to the production of other food crops.Although Zimbabwe lies in the Tropic Zone, its climate is moderated by high elevation. The average temperature is 60° F in July (winter) and 70° F in January (summer). The average annual rainfall is about 35 inches in the High Veld. Most rainfall occurs from November to March.
 Zimbabwe farms over 9,500 hectares in coffee. The majority of the crop is grown in the Chipinge district at an altitude of 4500 feet and is harvested from June to November. The most popular method of drying the coffee is in the sun, followed by six to eight weeks of conditioning. This, coupled with the unique growing conditions and the care that the farmers take in cultivation, results in a coffee that has a rich aroma and slightly spicy flavor with medium body.
 Coffee farming has had many false starts in Zimbabwe. Originally brought to the country by travelers in the 1890s, it was not broadly planted as was the case in other East African nations. It nearly died out again in the 1920s when plant disease destroyed most of the small plantations, making a resurgence again in 1958, and gaining establishment again in the 1960s. Zimbabwe established strict classification and grading standards in order to insure that fine quality coffees would be produced for export.
 The 1980s and '90s saw Zimbabwe coffee gaining ground in the market and in price, with the buyers starting to recognize its better flavor attributes. But land ownership was a politically charged issue, as huge tracts were held by a powerful elite for many decades. Large coffee Estates were often owned by long-established white families. These estates would often be surrounded by smaller farms of out-growers, often black farmers who gained financing and technical expertise from the Estate, as well as a market for their coffee. With political instability came charged rhetoric that emboldened militants who followed Mugabe seized large farms and estates.
 Coffee was often burned in mass land clearings, as it was seen as too much labor and not quickly profitable. As stability returned, there was direct damage to the capacity to produce any volume of good coffee. The best dry mills in the country shut down for lack of volume. The path forward in Zimbabwe is not entirely clear. We are finally seeing some quality samples from 2014/15 harvest. But we haven't found in Zimbabwe any counterparts with whom to work directly. The old model of bulking all coffee from one estate to sell full containers is not the way toward rebuilding a reputation, in my opinion. That was the '90s.

 Coffee  from China is becoming interesting, as better farming practices are  being employed in some cases, and coffee is being planted at higher  elevations than before. The cup is still quite basic in some ways, as  the varieties planted, environment and altitudes do not culminate in  creating a Central America type flavor profile, or other established  origins. But it has a soft coffee quality, balanced, good body, and a  modicum of acidity.
 Starting 10 years ago, we started receiving some interesting emails  about Chinese Yunnan Arabica coffee. I had only cupped various types of  commercial grade Yunnan coffees grown under 1000 meters. The emails  would read "You can order this coffee in whatever style you want :  Central American wet-processed style , Brazilian semi washed or  dry-processed style, Sumatran semi wet hull style. It is unique". The  fact is, until recently I have not found much of any flavor in these  commercial coffees. It is suited toward the mass "industrial coffee  market" meaning the R & G (roasted and ground) coffee market and  institutional roasting.
 I know that every new origin piques the interest, but that doesn't always make it good.
 More Recently I received a sample of Yunnan coffee that was markedly  better, a real specialty-level coffee. It was from the ManLao River  Plantation, that ranges from 3500-4500 feet with the coffee coming from  smallholder farms as well as a large estate. The cup was clean, bright  and had good sweetness, and was well processed. It was not a fresh new  crop sample so it scored 84, but it could be an 85-86 point in the  future. Yunnan can produce good coffee, and sometimes it's simply a  matter of what you are exposed to that colors those perceptions about  specific coffee origins.

 If there is a problem with Costa Rica coffee, it's the fact that it can lack distinction; it is straightforward, clean, softly acidic, mild. It has lots of "coffee flavor." The trend in Costa Rica was to create large volumes of moderately good "specialty" coffee. There was a push toward high-yield coffee shrubs that lacked the clarity in cup flavor of the older types. They also required a lot of fertilizer input to maintain their bountiful yields. The large mills mixed all the small-farm coffee cherries that were delivered, the high-grown and low-grown, the ripe fruits and the not-so-ripe. The result was mediocrity.
 For me, the main issue with Costa Rica had been the marketing model: big mills creating their own brands, not small farms with their own tree-to-bag processing. Since we are small and can handle small lots in a way that is not economical for a larger coffee company, we changed the way we sourced Costa Rican coffees in 2008 to offer coffees from the emerging movement of micro mill coffee production.
 This new quality initiative is coming from smaller mills, low-volume, farm-specific coffee producers who now keep their lots separate, mill it themselves, gaining control of the process, and fine-tuning it to yield the best possible flavors (and the best price). This change in processing is possible due to new environmentally-friendly small milling equipment, and fueled by the dissatisfaction of small producers who sell coffee at market prices, only to see it blended with average, carelessly-harvested lots.
 With an independent family mill, a farmer can become a true craftsperson, maximize the cup quality of their coffee, divide lots by elevation or cultivar, and receive the highest prices for their coffees. In turn, we get unique and diverse micro-lots, and long-term relationship with the small farmer. Some call it Direct Trade, but we call it our Farm Gate program, where we can be assured of exactly what the farmer received. And in these cases they yield 40%-100%+ more than Fair Trade prices.
 The range of flavors that result from Costa Rican coffees has expanded due to the new relationships we are forming, ranging from traditional wet-processed lots with vivid brightness and clean fruit notes, to ... well, radically different dry-processed coffees as well as pulped natural "honey" coffees. Some of these experiments have crossed a threshold into ill-advised procedures that result in curious, yet unstable flavor attributes. We are not big fans of producing dry-process coffees in areas that can't dry them well. The flavors may be outlandish, but the coffees tend to fade quickly, turning from fruit toward ferment, and from rustic sweetness to woody age notes.
 Costa Rica can still produce great clean wet-processed type coffees, but lately we have found that competition from buyers, high internal coffee cherry prices, and lack of commitment on the part of farmers to long-term relationships have made these coffees unattractive. On top of that, we can put together a table of blind samples from other Central American producing countries and find more clarity in the brightness and sweetness of the coffees. I would never say the Costa Rica highlands can't produce world-class lots, but there aren't as many as there are buyers, some tossing inflated prices at coffee lots that are of dubious cup character.
 Is the problem of Costa Rica's success its accessibility, and its downfall part of the constraints of other economic pressures, from the unchecked growth of San Jose and its suburbs, tourism and expatriate retirees, its educated and demanding work force, and their over-connectedness to the markets they sell into? It's the success of development, and yet in crops like coffee it seems oddly off base. I mean, I don't want the farms I work with to come up in Google with their own Flash-animated web sites. I want them to grown good coffee, that's all. Call me an imperialist. I have been to Costa Rica now many times. It's a five hour flight, after all. For more information check out the photos in the travelogue section of the Coffee Library page.

 There's no better way to learn about a coffee-producing country than to visit, and yet you can spend a lot of time in Bolivia and still not understand the complex relationship between coffee and culture. My first trip to Bolivia was really an awakening to the dramatic landscape, the soaring altitude of La Paz, the very basic lives of the coffee farmers, the complexities of the nations economy and politics.
 Great Bolivia coffees are delicate, bright and aromatically sweet, the classic "clean cup." They have subtle fruit notes, like pear, apple, apricot, tangerine and lemon. They can develop roast flavors that are malty, chocolatey, nutty (almond and hazelnut, not the off notes of peanut shells), with caramel or honey sweetness. The best flavors really emerge as the cup cools and do not diminish but grow in intensity.
Bolivia does indeed have all the ingredients to produce great coffee, especially in terms of altitude (plenty of that!) and seedstock: the plants are almost all traditional Typica varietal, with some Caturra. Much of the production is from traditional organic farming practices, with a lot of the co-ops certified Organic and Fair Trade as well.
 There are some quality issues that are being addressed with assistance from USAID, inspired largely by the attempt to limit coca production in the Andes This is expressed through direct farmer assistance and programs like Cup of Excellence. One problem is that the coffee was formerly sent from the main growing regions, the Yungas (a vast fertile region on the east-facing slopes of the Cordillera Occidental - the Western range) including the Caranavi region, to La Paz for processing. La Paz is the highest national capital on Earth, at a whopping 12,500 feet. The coffee was sent up the treacherous road when it was pulped, fermented and washed, but not fully dried.
 The combination of coffee that was moist enough to keep fermenting, plus frigid and dry atmosphere at a high altitude, dealt a "one-two punch" to the coffee chemistry, and weird flavors resulted. But now the co-ops are starting to process their coffee themselves, gaining more control over quality, providing more jobs in the community, and sending the coffee over the mountains only when it is in a physically stable condition. These are the nuts and bolts of how a coffee is transformed from an under-priced under-achiever to a recognized name in the market, a distinct origin, a unique cup character at full bloom.
 In recent years, some of the hopes for a broad range of top quality coffees from Bolivia, available from season to season, have not been realized. There is an issue with the Typica cultivar, especially when it is grown under rustic conditions by small-holder farmers, who tend to lack the resources for soil and plant inputs as well as great management of the coffee shrubs (pruning, etc). Typica plants seem to have a more exaggerated biennial output, but when you add poor nutrition and other agricultural practices it is a very dramatic drop from a high-volume harvest to a low-volume one. The extremes of high and low crops affect quality in terms of picking and milling as well. The system doesn't function well when it is overloaded with coffee, and the wet mills cannot keep up. Nor do you see the best quality coffees in extremely low harvests, where pickers tend to harvest more unripe cherries along with the ripe ones (they are paid by the volume they pick), and dry mills might relax standards to maximize their output.
 We have been going to Bolivia for years. Before the Cup of Excellence program took root in Bolivia, I attended a highly educational national cupping competition. You can check out my little odd Bolivia Movie if you are so inclined. Lately we have found great coffees, but in fairly small volumes and at top prices. This makes our Bolivia offerings a bit more expensive, but we feel the cup quality deserves the price. And the fact Bolivia comes in fresh at the time of year when the bright Central American coffees are flagging a bit makes them an attractive option to maintain the highest cup quality throughout the year.
 Kivu is the general name for East Congo (Kinshasa) and covers a very broad geographical area. It borders on Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Lake Tanganyika on the east. Kivu is divided into three provinces, Nord-Kivu (North Kivu), Sud-Kivu (South Kivu), and Maniema. Primary production includes coffee, cotton, rice, and palm oil, and tin and some gold are mined too. For coffee the quality potential is high, but the political turmoil and power struggles make actual stable business practice a huge challenge.
 The Ruwenzori mountains, Kahuzi-Biega National Park, and part of Maiko National Park are part of this region. Most of Kivu was controlled (1961—62) by the breakaway regime of Antoine Gizenga, which was centered at Kisangani (then Stanleyville). Kivu was a base for various rebel groups in the 1990s. Later, a revolt against the central Congolese government at Leopoldville [now Kinshasa] broke out in Kwilu and Kivu provinces.
 Since then the Kivu rebels have established a Revolutionary Government of the Eastern Congo with headquarters at Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi. (Part of the Congo problem is the direct involvement and support in turmoil sponsored by neighboring governments).
 The Ruzizi Valley in Kivu is controlled by the rebels who claim to be led by Patrice Lumumba (who in fact was killed in 1961!!!). With recent elections in Congo, the hope for stability and the continuation of the cease fire is possible. But this is a tumultuous political scene, with rare earth mineral, gold and diamond wealth as inspiration to the various factions. Consequently, the Kivu area is directly affected.
 Of course, smallholder coffee farmers are the first to suffer. So in a sense the export of coffee to the US is in itself a positive sign about East Congo stability. What I hope to see next is NGOs and others move in and try to firmly re-establish the coffee trade, rebuild mills, offer education toward specialty coffee production, and install a Fair Trade pricing model.
 The fact is, Congo coffee is being exported on the cheap. The price is below fair trade level - the bare minimum we like to pay, with most of our lots offered at higher-than-fair-trade prices. And even though the coffee comes from Cooperatives, it's very difficult to verify how much money actually makes it back to the farmer-members. With a little help, we hope to see this change, keeping fair and transparent business practices as a primary goal. We have encouraging prospects in the DRC, and with overall quality potential being high, there is a lot of interest.

 Frank Sinatra sang, "They grow an awful lot of coffee in Brazil." It is unquestionably true; it's the largest producer of arabica coffee and not a small amount of robusta too. Brazilian coffee is nutty, sweet, low in acidity and develops exceptional bittersweet and chocolate roast tastes. There's a long tradition of roasting Brazil in the United States. Brazil is roasted and sold as a single-origin coffee -- by region, cooperative or Fazenda -- but it is often used in blends for the sake of cost control. Brazil coffees are common in espresso, both in high-end blends and in commercial coffees like Dunkin Donuts. Even the broken fragments of beans and the dust from the dry mills is sold, ending up in some awful coffee product somewhere, most likely instant.
 There's the big push on behalf of Brazilian coffee growing associations to create the image of their coffees as a distinct flavor profile, but there just isn't the extreme distinction that identifies one Brazilian coffee from another. Attention to good farming and processing techniques has helped, but the coffee is grown at lower altitudes than most Specialty coffee, in poor quality soils, in open areas that were often originally grassland (a reason why the "shade-grown" criteria really doesn't apply much to Brazil).
 What is true with Brazil is true with all other coffee-producing origins as well. People outside the coffee trade want clear distinctions about quality: Is Brazilian coffee good? Those within the coffee trade are happy to provide the answer roasters and consumers want to hear: "Yes- it's good!" But the question itself is flawed. Every origin with the capability to produce good coffee can produce horrible coffee as well. Farms side-by-side can produce differing qualities of coffee, and within the a single farm or cooperative there is a full spectrum of coffee cup quality. The real question is to ask is whether each lot tastes good, where a "lot" means one batch of coffee processed through the mill. That question is answered in comparative cupping of the coffees for taste quality.
 As far as Brazil goes, the issues are complex. Here is a country that produces relatively few containers of coffee that truly cup from 84-87 points, and a staggering quantity of coffee that cups below 80 points, commercial-grade coffee. As far as coffees that are truly 88+ points, I feel this is not only rare from Brazil, but nearly impossible, given the varietals and bean density. Yes, relative to other Brazils and the classic flavor profile of these lower grown, soft coffees, they can go higher. But on a global scale, can a Brazil reach the ranges of the best Ethiopia, Kenya, Colombia or Guatemala wet-processed coffees? I don't think so.
 Then again, Brazil coffees are solid, crowd-pleasing coffees with outstanding body, and nut-to-chocolate roast tones. They also appeal to the palate than finds acidity, the flavorful brightness in better coffees, somehow annoying. And nothing touches a really good Brazil coffee as a base in espresso blends, for the ease with which they produce good physical characteristics (mouthfeel and crema) as well as nice base flavor.
 Brazils are not complex coffees, and don't have impressive acidity that adds a vivid brightness to coffees from higher-grown areas of Guatemala, or Ethiopia. But Brazils are a different sort of beast than those origins. Brazils are not dense coffee seeds: they are grown at lower altitudes than Central American coffees. Hence the very dark roasts of Brazil coffees pick up ashy, bittering flavors. For espresso, you can roast Brazils lighter, separately, or keep the entire blend at a Vienna roast or lighter.
 There are 3 methods of processing Brazil coffees of interest to us; Dry- Process (Natural), Pulped Natural, and Semi-Washed. They produce different types of cups. The Natural has great body, chocolate, possibly fruity notes ... and it risks being earthier and more rustic in the cup. The Pulped Natural is created when the coffee cherry skin is removed and the parchment, with much of the mucilage attached, is sun-dried on patio or raised drying bed. This coffee cups like the more like Natural coffee, but is a bit cleaner in the cup. The Semi-Washed uses a demucilage machine to remove the skin and the mucilage. The Semi-Washed ranges in character from being close to Pulped Natural in flavor profile, to being similar to a wet-processed coffee (clean cup, uniform, less body, less chocolate, a bit brighter).
 I like good naturals and pulped naturals (called cereja descascada in Brazil). They have more intensity, produce more crema, but I have to cup them rigorously to watch for defective cup character. On the other hand, really clean Semi-Washed, where a lot of the mucilage is removed, do not have typical Brazil character to me. Yes, these coffees score higher and they are now totally dominating the Cup of Excellence competition. But if you want a cleaner, brighter cup, the standard is set elsewhere, not Brazil. Go buy a good Central American coffee.
 For espresso, I used to employ natural Brazils in blends, then changed them in favor of more consistent (and less quakery) pulped naturals. Now we only use Brazils in a couple blends, and I could imagine a day when we don't use any! The coffees are soft (the opposite of dense) and can lack the kind of sweetness we hold dear in espresso.
 The trick is that Brazils prefer a lower initial roast temperature and can turn quite ashy tasting when roasted too dark. My personal preference is that Brazils for espresso are rested quite a while after roasting -- in fact I had a straight pulped natural I roasted to a light Vienna for espresso, and I kept testing the cup because 2 days after roasting it was too lively, nippy - almost like a baking soda effect on your tongue. After 18 days it became one of the deepest. heavy bodied espresso I ever had! I am not saying coffee should be rested that long after roasting (especially other methods like French Press, Drip etc, which fade after as little as 7 days!), but if you don't have a good initial experience with a Brazil espresso, don't toss it - try it after a week, or even two. As far as the type of Brazil, Illy is said to use 100% pulped natural and semi-washed.
 Most quality Brazil I have found comes from the Sul de Minas: Carmo de Minas, Cerrado and Matas de Minas. Cerrado region is, apparently, not a name many Brazilians recognize ... at last not those I have spoken with. Cerrado is a savanna-like area, dry and flat, in Minas Gerais state. They produce a lot of coffee, and there are some un-blended single farm lots that are good. Two micro-regions in Cerrado were of special interest to us: Chapadao de Ferro and Serra do Salitre. Now we focus efforts to the southeast of there.
 People ask me about "Santos" coffee: Santos is a port, not a producing region. Coffee labeled Santos is pooled from market-grade lots and the lowest common denominator expresses itself as the primary cup character.
 
I have older travelogues of Brazil Cerrado Cupping Competition and trips through the Sul de Minas, Mogiana, and Matas de Minas coffee growing regions. You might also be interested to read the Jan-Feb '03 issue of our Tiny Joy newsletter: Brazil-O-Rama: excellent choices in Brazilian Coffee.

 From the country formerly known as upper Rhodesia, and now named for the Zambezi River, Zambian coffees range from Kenya-like brightness, to subtle, balanced coffees with complexity and body. Zambia has variable quality: it has the potential to be outstanding (which is why we offer particular lots when we find an excellent coffee), and it can be very off-tasting and defective (which is why we're usually out of stock for long stretches).
 Coffee was introduced in the 1950's with cultivar seedstock from Tanzania and Kenya. It is grown mainly in the Northern district of the Muchinga Mountains (regions of Nakonde, Kasama and Isoka) and in the vicinity of the capital city of Lusaka.
 The past few crops produced some real duds ...do not expect every coffee with an exotic East African name to be good! In fact, I think the logistics of shipping these coffees can result in a marked loss of flavor, or in the case of Tanzania, baggy flavors from being stored in shipping containers for long periods at port! If it is good coffee, it has to be handled properly and shipped quickly. When this isn't done, the defective coffee is easily detected on our cupping table. Anyway, when we have a Zambian in stock you can bet it is good!
 Zambia seems to have cup quality issues stemming from basic agricultural and environmental challenges; with water and drought, soil management, relatively lower altitudes of coffee plantings, and some fairly non-stellar coffee varieties in production.
 We started offering Zambian coffee in a different era: The 2000 crop ranged from unremarkable estate coffees to very poor quality generic stocklots of peaberry and flatbean. These were widely available, and I thought they were all very poor in the cup. It is sad to know that these low quality lots are ruining a good origin's reputation, and that some "specialty" roaster somewhere is buying this stuff and selling it as "good" coffee.

 With the stately and scenic Mount Kilimanjaro marking the coffee-producing lands of the North, and beautiful Lake Tanganyika in the South, it may seem remarkable that Tanzania coffee can remain in the shadows to that of any other land. But when you neighbor Kenya, the powerhouse of coffee in East Africa, it's not only possible, it is likely. A mixed history of false-starts in coffee production, the unsure agendas of German and English colonial rule, priorities for other food crops, and unfortunate loss of coffee trees from plant illness has held Tanzania from its coffee potential, in both volume and cup quality.
 That potential glimmers on the horizon, sometimes achieved by the highest-grown Estates and small-holder Cooperatives. But sometimes the quality is lost in translation ... or more precisely, in transit. The Tanzania coffee character is typical of East African washed (wet-processed) coffees: It is generally bright (acidic), and almost aggressively flavorful. Lack of balance can be an issue sometimes, but the main risks are faulty flavors from bad fermentation, and storage or transit damage. The abundance of bureaucracy around coffee exportation, especially when you try to do something milkly innovative like a shipment of mixed micro-lots, can result in coffee stuck at the sweltering hot port of Dar Es Salaam. Even hermetic packaging like Grainpro-lined jute bags, or vacuum packing, does not prevent damage to the cup quality of coffee under these conditions.
 Coffee is grown in the North and South zones and there is good quality potential from both areas, although buyers are more familiar with the northern Kilimanjaro and Meru coffees from around Arusha and Moshi. There is also potential in Kigoma area near Lake Tanganyika. The Kagera area near Lake Victoria is a robusta growing zone, with coffea canephora making up some 25% of all coffee grown in Tanzania. In the south, Mbinga in the Songea area has produced a solid cup, and the drier Mbeya region is perfect for coffee growing and processing.
 Coffea arabica came to Tanzania with Jesuits and German colonization, and it was likely quite similar Bourbon varieties still grown to this day. Original strains of coffees from the isle of Bourbon (now Reunion) were distributed through East Africa in this period, sometimes named for missionary groups who brought them such as French Mission Bourbon or Scottish Mission Bourbon. Kent variety was brought from India, but is rare to find in production. Newer hybrids are N39, which is distinctly a Bourbon-type in its form, and the lovely-named KP432. Would you like a delicious cup of KP432 this morning?
 TACRI, the research institution in Tanzania, has aggressively developed new varieties to improve disease resistance and increase yields for the farmers of Tanzania. We hope new varieties will cup as well as the old Bourbons, and not include the problematic Robusta genetics that come with Catimor types. That's a tall order though. Coffee fungus diseases and coffee wilt are serious issues in Tanzania, as well as imbuing seedstock with drought-resistant characteristics. While coffee is an important crop and accounts for 20% of export income, water for sustenance crops and for humans is more vital to the health of the people!
 Peaberry from Tanzania has had a unique marketing niche in the United States, and I am not sure why. Peaberries are often sorted out and sold at premiums here over what they can get other places, but the cup is sometimes tainted and not worth the price. There is no inherent quality in a peaberry because of its shape, although the roast dynamic is different and (I feel) benefits small home air-powered roasters. Peaberries occur more in plants with poor nutrition, deformed roots, or those stressed by other factors like lack of water in the maturation stages (a big problem in parts of Tanzania). But the quality issues arise mostly in that a peaberry bulk lot is often collected from many growers over an extended period of time, meaning a mix of the good and bad, the freshly harvested and the older coffee waiting to be bulked up. That's not a great prelude for success in the cup.
 We are now working direct in selecting specific cooperative and small estate coffees first hand in Tanzania, primarily because our in-country partners have done the footwork to provide us that capability. In the past, nearly all coffee had to be traded through the weekly auction run by the government's Coffee Board. And even if they could find buying partners who would pay more, for financing reasons, regulations and tradition, many fine coffees were sent to auction only to end up bulked for more commercial full-container sales.
 2014 is the first year we will be working direct in Tanzania, meaning we are selecting lots in Tanzania with the help of exporters, visiting the farmer groups and estates that cup well, and thinking ahead to longer term relationships. In part this is possible because the Coffee Board allows direct sales now; every coffee lot is not required to go through the auction. And secondly, we have found some good partners on the ground who understand quality. While it means we take greater risk on the coffee delivered to us, having exporters in the country who are clear about the expectation of cup quality, and are taking steps to mitigate the short-comings of the "usual way" coffee is handled, means it is a good time for me to take a more active role in sourcing in Tanzania.
  
With the coffee we are bringing in this year, the farmer receives prompt payment for parchment coffee delivered to the warehouse at fair local price level. Then when the coffee finds a buyer who pays a premium, there is a second payment distributed to all farmers in the group. That can go toward household needs, educating the family, wherever the need is. But in the off-season there is also targeted assistance to improve the health of the coffee shrubs, improve the wet-mill, and dedicated assistance from an agronomist. This means motivated farmers, who have an increasingly better chance with each harvest of improving their yields, producing coffee that scores better in the cup, for which we will pay more ... a much more positive cycle for them, and great coffee for us, now and in the future. 
 Hawaii... what a nice place. They grow nuts, fruit, and coffee. The coffee is expensive. It is mild (sometimes too mild). It can be terrible and flat, or it can be wonderful! The best coffees cost a lot and the worst cost way too much. So the goal with Hawaiians is to quit thinking that all Hawaiian coffee is good, and to realize that only a handful of coffees deserve the high price in terms of cup quality (you can easily argue that all deserve a high price in terms of the care and labor expended in producing them). And frankly, you must pay quite a bit for the truly great small-farm Kona.
 We had occasionally offered coffees from Maui, Molokai, and Kauai. But these are not usually grown like true small farm Estate grade coffees from the Big Island, nor do they taste like them. Kona isn't grown at impressive altitudes compared to other coffee origins, but on Maui and Kauai coffee is grown at exceptionally low elevations, sometimes near tide pool level! Also, much Kona is an older coffee variety, Typica, a traditional type that cannot be grown at the lowest elevations. Recently, we found out that Ka'u coffees have come a long way, and can be excellent. So Ka'u is a region with credible quality potential.
 In a historical sense, coffees like Kona are the pinnacle of a particular definition of what "good coffee" is: clean, pleasant, mild, good aftertaste. This is a notion of "good coffee" handed down from a time when low-grade coffee was called Brazil Rio and it had a seriously foul, dirty taste (so distinctly awful it is still called Rioy in defective coffee terminology). The best coffees were considered the polar opposite; island coffees -- mild, delicate and clean.
 Certain exotic coffee origins we appreciate as intense and unusual flavor profiles, such as Yemeni coffees, Ethiopian Harar, and wet-hulled Sumatras for example, would be considered defective in this definition. If you love those intense coffees, Kona may seem too timid, too simple, too mild. With scores in the mid-80s, they don't rate like the best Kenyas or Ethiopias, but the descriptors indicate balance and clean cup quality. Consider this when you taste good Hawaiian coffees.
 The famously fragile ecology of Hawaii has been shattered; along with other invasive species and insects, the recent appearance of Broca, the Coffee Berry Borer insect, has had a huge negative effect on the farms of Hawaii. Coffee is being downgraded before export, and can't fetch the prices it used to as an Extra Fancy grade when it gets knocked down to Kona No. 1 Grade. The affected beans do affect cup quality, but can be sorted out. Yet this takes labor, and in an expensive market that is just not feasible. Still, we are landing some really nice small-farm coffees, and paying prices to offset the losses the farms are experiencing from this latest crisis.

 Green coffee is decaffeinated before roasting. This process changes the color of the green coffee: it varies from light brown (Natural and CO-2) to green-brown (MC and Swiss Water Process -SWP- decafs). There is another decaf we list as WP, Water Process, which is a water filtration method similar to Swiss Water, but performed at a plant in Mexico.
 Click here to read more about the C0-2 process and here to learn more about caffine in general and other processes. Beware...there are some gnarly photos of steaming mounds of caffeine in there.
 The arrival of decafs always follows the main crop of a coffee by some months, since the coffee needs to be shipped to the decaffeination plant. Oddly, there are only a few such plants in the world, so decaf coffee has to travel a long way usually from origin, to plant and then to the buyer's country. This adds to the cost too, so decafs are often a bit pricier.
 Decaf coffees might roast faster than non-decaf coffees. Part of the differences in how a decaf roasts is due to the physical changes the coffee has experienced in the decaffeination process. But in an air roaster it is also affected by the smooth surface of the bean, which allows more air to flow around the coffee without transferring the roaster heat to the bean. This smooth appearance is due to the fact that decaffeination removes much of the thin chaff silverskin from the outside of the coffee. As a plus, decaf produces little chaff that will collect in your roaster's chaff collector.
 Because of the darker color of decaf coffees, it is difficult to roast decaf by judging the color. It's best to pay attention to the sound of the cracks and the roast aromas. It takes a few roasts to understand these sights and smells, but its a fun process and even if the coffee comes out a bit too light or too dark, it will still be freshly home roasted! And that beats most store-bought coffee any day!
 Decafs can have a lower 1st and 2nd crack temperature, and can progress faster between the cracks. You can also see oils emerge a few days after roasting a decaf despite the fact that you did not reach 2nd crack (the usual reason you would see oils emerge). This is because the bean structure of a decaf is more fragile after the process, and the cell walls in the coffee tend to rupture at a lower temperature, allowing oils to migrate to the surface. As with all coffees, oils stale when exposed to oxygen, so it is preferred that your coffee is not oily on the surface, but for darker roasts and decafs it is unavoidable.

 Good news or scary as heck? 
 Geneticists are working on a plant that will grow coffee with no caffeine content, thus needing no processing to remove the caffeine. Is this good? It means no factory process to remove caffeine. It also could mean contamination between natural unmodified trees and modified ones. Coffee is very complex in terms of it's chemical makeup. it has over 800 compounds contributing to the flavor, more than any other beverage. Can you turn off one genetic attribute and not affect others? We shall see the results from the current research work being conducted in Hawaii.

 Sometimes tasting something that isn't coffee can help you learn more about what your coffee tastes like. If you think about it, brewed coffee has such a huge range of tastes and flavors that are affected by origin, processing, storage, roasting, brewing, etc. so it can be fun to break down what we experience in every cup. Communicating those flavors can be challenging since we all might have different ideas of what "chocolate", "citrus" or "fruited" tastes like. The same goes for "sugar". There are so many different sugars that taste different from one another. We thought it would be interesting to taste few side by side so we diluted a bunch of them in water and took some time to taste their sugary differences.
 Construction on our new location is coming along and we expect to move in sometime early this summer. Concrete flooring is in. Walls are in (mostly) and we are enjoying how expansive the warehouse space looks for now. Once we move in our storage racks and thousands of pounds of coffee it won't feel as spacious.
 Did your favorite coffee go out of stock last month? It might be on this list of coffees that we recently ran out of. Check out our suggestions for replacements that we think you will enjoy. This a great opportunity to try new  coffees with similar  flavors and characteristics.

 Nicaraguan  coffees have a wide range of flavor attributes. Some cup like Mexican  coffees from Oaxaca, others have a more pronounced acidity. Some are  mildly citrusy and bright, such as the coffees of Dipilto in Nueva  Segovia department. The botanical cultivars utilized are traditional:  Typica, some Bourbon and Maragogype dominate, along with Caturra and  Pacas. There is some of the less desirable Catimor varietal, but many  farms removed it after the "catimor craze" 10-20 years ago passed.
 When in season, we offer some new "exotic" cultivars too: a Pacamara,  a "Java" cultivar and the large bean Maragogype. Pulp Natural process  is also a variation that gives the cup great body and a slightly rustic  fruited layer. It seems that many of the growers in Nicaragua, sensing  that the value of their Caturra coffees reaches a certain ceiling and  rises no further, are trying many combinations of coffee variety and  processing to command higher prices. We value the approachable sweetness  and restraint of wet-processed old-style varietals like Bourbon and  Typica, and their offspring like Caturra. We feel that an occasional  foray into the exotic is fine, but people want to drink these classic  coffees more often than unbalanced, one-off, odd coffees. So we like to  see growers focus the core of their efforts toward these sweet and  elegant coffees, not the flash-in-the-pan varietals or processing  experiments.
 If you are a fan of a heavy Full City or Vienna roast (in either  case, you are letting the 2nd crack start and you stop the roast before  it gains its momentum), then you really need to try a Jinotega or  Matagalpa Nicaraguan at that roast level. They have enough body to stand  up to dark roasts and the great balance and pungent bittersweetness is  unparalleled! Roasted to Vienna stage, these coffees can make excellent  and unique single-origin espresso.

 Colombia is a diverse group of growing regions spread from North to South along the three "cordilleras," the mountain ranges that are the Northern extensions of the Andes. Colombian coffees can be outstanding. Most coffee, especially from the Southern growing areas of Huila, Cauca, Narino and Tolima, comes from small family farms, and when the picking and processing are done well they can be exceptional: Silky body, cane sugar sweetness, floral hints and traces of tropical fruits are found in the best Colombia coffees.
 We work primarily in the areas of Narino, Huila and Cauca and make many visits each year to visit farms and cup coffees, but most of the work happens in Oakland at our lab, where we receive hundreds of samples to cup. We grade these either as clean and sweet coffees that are good enough for our micro-blends (either by farmer group or small regions), or as single-farmer micro-lots. Each of these micro-lot samples represents a single farmer's work over the period of a week or two and represents a lot of 1/2 to 5 bags of parchment coffee. The main image on our Colombia page is Walter Penna, one of the farmers that has coffee designated as micro-lot quality, from Pedregal, Huila. He is next to a pile of parchment coffee, the green bean still intact in the shell, and inside a parabolic drying cover to protect the coffee from rain, as well as provide gentle diffused light and heat for even drying.
 It's important to make a distinction between the way we work in a country like Colombia, and the majority of Colombian coffee imported into this country that ends up at a roastery, a cafe, or in coffee bins at a market.
 Colombian coffee has been highly marketed in the US for many decades by the FNC, the Federacion Nacional de Cafe. They have been successful at equating the name Colombian Coffee with "good" coffee. This is half-true. Colombian coffee is bulked into container lots that lack clean cup character and distinctive flavor attributes. This is the case with all origins in fact: There are stellar Ethiopian coffees but that does not mean Ethiopia coffee necessarily means good coffee. The fact that coffee is now marketed by origin country, sub-region, farm, farmer name, or which side of the tree they picked does not guarantee good quality. Also, indiscriminate mixing of good and bad lots, well-processed clean coffees with over-fermented batches, or ones that might have been re-wet by rain showers when drying, results in the lowest common denominator for the entire shipment of coffee.
 Is there good Colombian coffee? Absolutely, but not from Supermarket bulk bins and the like. Good Colombian is rarely sold simply as Supremo or Excelso, a name that designates the size of the beans only and means nothing about the quality of taste. Grading by screen size doesn't make sense because a larger bean does not mean better cup quality. In fact, the presence of diverse bean sizes can result in better cup quality, but not necessarily. Since we rate everything by cup quality and all coffees are judged "blind," bean size is irrelevant and doesn't enter into how we select coffees.
 Among the generic pooled lots are regional coffees branded only by the Department (State) they come from, Huila, Medellin, Antioquia, Cauca, or very general sub-region distinctions like San Augustin or Pitalito. These lots can be okay, but recent samples have showed a tendency towards the use of non-traditional varietals like Variedad Colombian or the newer Castillo cultivar, both catimor types that offer disease-resistance at the expense of taste quality. There are still older types of "aqua-pulp" processing in use in Colombia from volume-oriented mills, and these tend to have a fruity taste on arrival, while they fade into a cup with paper-cardboard taint in a few months.
 Many areas of Colombia have two crops: a main harvest and the "mitaca," where the coffee shrub will be producing flowers for the next semi-annual harvest while it is being harvested with red ripe coffee cherry. It poses problems both for the plant and its limited amount of energy, as well as a physical risk of damaging the flower buds while picking the ripe fruit. More significant is the presence of coffee rust fungus (roya), as well as the coffee berry borer insect (CBB, or broca). With climate change, these problems are spreading to coffee regions within Colombia that were never at risk previously. And in areas where they were formerly present only at lower altitudes, for example the valleys in Huila at 1200 meters, these blights are now found on the slopes overlooking these areas, at 1600 and 1700 meters. This is severely affecting the volume of coffee a tree can produce, and the incomes of the farming families.

 Color is just one of the ways to determine degree of roast. By itself, it is of limited use. When complemented    by the audible cues (first and second crack) and the aromas of the roast process,  it is extremely   informative . Here's a video showing the color changes that occur during roasting.
 This coffee was roasted           on my Probat 12 kilo so I could take advantage of the sample trier. Ignore the times, and take         the temperatures as a  ballpark figure. 
 The important thing is here is to see the transformation  the coffee goes through as it         roasts and what look, color, bean          size and surface texture, corresponds to the degree of         roast. ***(see note from home roaster George Steinert below).
 Roasting is more about exceptions than rules. I have this page about bean color vs. ground coffee color that might be helpful. So get to it.
 (click on preview for   full size image)
 
Note: The above image is not the exact          same beans pictured below. The gray strips on either side          of this image are a photographic 18% gray card.

 1. Green          unroasted coffee 0:00 - 75 f
 This is a wet processed, Central American coffee, a accidental blend I   have had sitting around. Each photo here are different coffee seeds from the batch I roasted so          size and shape will vary seed to seed.
 2. Starting          to pale  4:00 - 270 f
 Drum          roasters take a long time to transfer heat to coffee so there is little          change in the first few minutes. In an air roaster coffee gets to this stage so much faster because of          the efficient heat transference of the rapid moving air stream, so the whole warm-up phase can be as fast as two minutes. 
 3. Early          yellow stage  6:00 - 327 f
 At this point the coffee is still losing water          in the form of steam and no physical expansion of the bean has taken place.          The coffee          has a very humid, hay-like smell at this point. All of these warm-up stages          leading up to first crack are part of an endothermic process, as the coffee          takes on heat, leading to the first audible roast reaction, the exothermic          1st crack.
 4. Yellow-Tan          stage  6:30 - 345 f
 The roast is starting to assume a browner color,          and a marbling appearance is starting to emerge. No bean expansion yet.          The first "toasty" smells (toasted grain, bread) can be detected,          and a bit less wet, humid air coming off the coffee. Note that some coffees          turn a brighter and more distinct yellow at this time, such as Costa Rican          and Mexican coffees.
 5. Light          Brown stage 8:00 - 370 f
 First crack is drawing near at this point. Some          bean expansion is visible as the central crack in the coffee has opened          slightly. The coffee releases some silverskin or  chaff. 
 6. Brown          Stage  9:00 - 393 f
 Now we are right at the door of first crack. The coffee has browned considerably, which is partly due          to browning reactions from sugars, but largely due to another browning          reaction called the Maillard Reaction (which also is responsible for browning          of cooked beef!) 
 7. 1st crack          begins  9:20 - 401 f
 At this point, the very first popping sounds of          the First Crack can be heard. This sound can be similar to popcorn pops (in distinction to the sound of the Second Crack, which has a shallower          sound, more like a snap).  At the          point of first crack the internal bean temperature would be around 356          f. 
 8. 1st crack          under way 10:00 - 415 f
 As first crack continues the coffee still appears          mottled and uneven in color. The coffee  starts expanding         in size and shows visible cracks. The amount of chaff in the crease of the seed is noticeably less. 
 First crack is an exothermic reaction; the beans          are giving off heat. But then the beans quickly become endothermic,          meaning that a roaster that is not adding enough heat to the process will          stall the roast at this point ...not a good thing. Once caramelization          begins (340-400 degrees internal bean temperature) a roast that looses          heat will taste "baked", perhaps due to the disruption on long-chain          polymerization. The melting point of sucrose is 370 f and corresponds          to this window of temperatures when caramelization begins. 
 9. 1st crack          finishes  10:40 - 426 f
 This is considered a City Roast. First crack is done and the roast is stopped. 
 Notice the  bean  surface is smoother somewhat from expansion but still has darker          marks in the coffee, like a finely etched pattern. The edges of the seed are still fairly hard. At this point the coffee          starts giving off carbon dioxide. 
 City+ means the coffee has cleared         first crack, and time is allowed for an even bean surface appearance         to develop.
 There are only very small changes between the #9 picture above and this one, notably the edges of the bean are a bit softer. The whole stage between the first and second crack is          a short period ( 15 to 30 seconds) where a lot is happening chemically to the beans. The  coffee gains heat once again          until  its woody cellulose matrix, the bean          structure itself, begins to fracture ... that is, the Second Crack. 
 
Click on image                for large photo, or here              for multi-bean photo. Check here for the whole bean vs. ground coffee comparison photo  or a Macro photos of a single City + bean.
 11. Full          City roast 11:30 - 444 f
On the verge of 2nd crack
 This image represents a  Full City roast; the coffee          is on the verge of 2nd crack. This might be hard to judge the first few times you roast; after a while, you will have a feel for it. The beans are have a slight sheen of oil and the edges are softer.
 The internal bean temperature for second          crack normally  is 446 degrees farenheit. But in fact second          crack is a bit less predictable than first crack, in my experience.          Why? It could be due to the fact that first crack is the physical expansion          of the coffee seed as water and carbon dioxide split and CO2 outgassing          starts. Second Crack is the physical fracturing of the celllose matrix          of the coffee. This matrix is   both organized cellulose that reacts readily to heat, and not-so-organized          cellulose that does not. Since every coffee is physically different in          size and density due to the cultivar, origin, altitude, etc., it           make sense that the particular cell matrix is different too, and not as          universally consistent.
 12. Full          City+ roast  11:50 - 454 f
First          audible snaps of 2nd crack 
 The darker side of a Full          City roast is Full City +, where the coffee has barely entered 2nd crack. A few snaps are heard, and the roast is then stopped. Second crack may continue into the cooling phase - this is called "coasting". The more effective and rapid your cooling - the better your ability to stop the roast at the degree you want.
 Compare the full size          images from the  Full City roast and this one, and I think it is          easy to see a difference. Well, maybe not easy, but the Full City+ roast is a bit fuller, more small cracks on the face (or flat side) of the bean.
 13. Vienna          - Light French roast  12:15 - 465 f
2nd          crack is under way
(This is my darkest espresso roast) 
 The Vienna stage (also called Continental) to Light          French stage is where you begin to find Origin Character eclipsed          by Roast Character.  A dark or heavy roast is at odds with buying coffee for its distinct origin qualities. Dark roast coffees tend to taste more like each other - as the differences due to  distinct origins are obscured by the carbony roast flavors.          Nontheless, some coffees are excellent at this stage (our Puro Scuro blend          is engineered for this roast range). 
 By the way; Espresso is not a roast. But Northern          Italian style espresso is usually roasted to 440 - 446 internal bean temperature.          Southern Italian (Scura) is generally a Light French Roast or a tad darker.          
 14. Full          French roast 12:40 - 474 f
2nd          crack is very rapid, nearing          its end.
 Sugars are heavily caramelized (read as burned)          and are degraded; the woody bean structure is carbonizing and the seed continues          to expand and loose mass. The body of the resulting cup will be thinner/lighter          as the aromatic compounds, oils, and soluble solids are being burned out          of the coffee and rising up to fill your house with smoke. 474 is well          beyond any roast I do on the Probat. I will go as high as 465 on a couple          blends, and that's my limit.
 Notice how fast and dramatic the change is from the previous photo - all that happened in less than 30 seconds!
 15. Fully          carbonized  13:00 - 486 f
Some call this Italian or Spanish roast, an insult to          either!
 At this stage, the coffee can be over 25% ash; it is carbonized, dead,          charcoal.
 16. Imminent          fire ... 13:30 - 497 f
 This bean is right at the verge of fire - in fact          you can actually start a fire with a large batch once you dump the coffee          out of the roast drum into the cool tray. The sudden rush of oxygen might          be the needed ingredient for cafe del fuego. Kids, grab your marshmallows!          Hope you like 'em smokey!
  Needless to say, this roast level is full-on carbon and you          can write your name with a coffee bean. The bean size here is          smaller that photo 15 due to the randomness of the seeds selected to photograph          - coffee does not get smaller at this stage...
 ***Note from George Steinert, home roaster: "I         see a lot of new users of the iRoast2 struggling to make sense of roast         levels.  I have been using the iR2 since February.  I           got the best success when I added the digital thermometer with thermocouple           probe (both from SM) and condensed the well-documented "degree of           roast" information on the SM web site into a one page chart (below).   By           using the temps on the chart (as measured with the thermocouple planted           in the bean mass) as a "guide" and when combining that with actual experience of           hearing the cracks (when they can be heard through the fan noise), the           color, the smell, and the time (when using a consistent load of green           beans), I have had very predictable results.  I continue to use           the chart as my baseline of understanding when roasting with the RK drum           which I started using in  June.  I reference the           start and end of first crack to tell me how the roast is progressing.  After           a while, the aroma becomes a factor.  About 60-90 seconds before           first crack begins, I swear I can tell it's coming because of a characteristic           aroma.   Primarily I use the sounds           of the crack(s) and secondarily, the time.  With the iRoast2, the           temp from the thermocouple gives a pretty reliable indication of where           they are in the roasting process...given some flexibility regarding start           and end of first crack depending on the type of beans.  With           the iRoast, you also have the helpful cues of color and seeing what's           happening on the surface of the bean.  Users should note that           First Crack is not going to necessarily begin when your thermocouple           hits 401 degrees F nor end when it hits 426 F but after you've done           a few dozen roasts you will get the feel for how to overlay the progress     of the roast onto the temperatures you are reading.
 George Steinert's Degree of Roast/Temperature chart:
 Please note that both Tom and George emphasize that temperature alone       will NOT determine degree of roast. Each roaster is different and different       beans roast slightly differently as well. All the information on this page       is to be take together to help determine degree of roast - no one element       (appearance, sound, temperature, etc) can determine degree of roast. Most       importantly - TASTE THE COFFEE - and see what that tells you about how       it roasted.
 Note about High Altitude Roasting
Having lived my entire life at or near sea level (Chicago, Boston, Ohio, Oakland), I may be chromosomally incapable of understanding the effects of high altitude or cooking or roasting. But I did want to make a note to pass on what seems to be the collective wisdom on high altitude home roasting, which is that in general you will see the roast happen more quickly, at a lower temperature. This is most true in small convection roasters, like a popper, or Fresh Roast or i-Roast, but also occurs in conduction roasting. So expect to adjust roast times accordingly. If you can control the temperature on the roaster at all, adjust target temperatures downward by 20 to 30 degrees. 

 Here is a representative image I took of the Agtron Roast         Color Tiles, and might give you a basica idea of the color scale. There       is a bit of glare on the left side though (most visibile on Agrton 45). Since       this is such an approximation and the appearance depends so much on monitor       calibration, etc, I am not going to put a ton of work into this ... I am       working on a better method of sharing these roast colors information.

 Cameroon is an oddball in the Specialty Coffee terms. For starters, this is West African coffee, not East African like most other arabica offerings such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda. And a large percentage of Cameroon's coffee has traditionally been robusta, grown in all provinces except the north, while arabica is mainly produced in the high altitudes of the west, northwest, and east. The western highlands of Cameroon, where much of the coffee is grown, averages about 5,000 feet above sea level and has two distinct seasons, the rainy season and dry season, which benefits quality arabica. This lot is from the CAPLAMI Cooperative in Mifi region of Western Province. CAPLAMI has over 2500 members, altitudes ranging from 1300 to 1800 meters. It is an unusual longberry Java cultivar, and cup qualities bear some resemblance to Indonesian character, but this one has many distinct differences too.

 Burundi is a small landlocked country at the crossroads of East and Central Africa, straddling the crest of the Nile-Congo watershed. Sandwiched between Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania, Burundi has beautiful Lake Tanganyika for much of its western border. The capital of Bujumbura borders the Lake, and is the port of export. The coffee can be exported from Mombasa, Kenya or Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, but both are long overland routes that can experience delays on the road or at port. This can affect the condition of the coffee greatly, and is a huge challenge in preserving the original quality of Burundi coffee. 
 Burundi has an ideal terrain for coffee, with growing regions dispersed in the central and northern areas. Burundi is dominated by hills and mountains, with considerable altitude variation, from the lowest point being the lake at 772 meters above sea level  to the top of Mount Heha at 2670 meters. We have offered a selection of large and small lots from areas Kirimiro, Ngozi and Kayanza in the past. These were formerly available as "Sogestal" coffees, but now can be sourced from private mills as well. A Sogestal is a regional grouping of washing stations (wet mills). The Sogestal system was instituted and controlled by the government, and is currently being dismantled due to inefficiencies, and farmer discontent. It worked for producing larger volumes of washed (wet-processed) coffees for sale to coffee traders, but not as a model to gain increased prices in the marketplace or higher payments to farmers. 
 Coffee farming does not have an extraordinarily long history here, as with the other Lake region coffees of East Africa.  The first Arabica coffee tree in Burundi was introduced by the Belgians in the early 1930s and has been growing in the country ever since. Coffee cultivation is an entirely smallholder  farmer activity with over 700,000 families directly involved in coffee farming. Their combined total acreage is roughly 60,000 hectares in the whole country and planted with about 25 million coffee trees. In fact the rural population was legally obligated at one time to plant coffee; 50 trees per farmer. Burundi has struggled through the upheavals of decolonization and horrific civil war, and still has one of the lowest per capita incomes in Africa. This belies the stunning beauty of the place and the warmth of the people. The reorganizing of the coffee industry, with a revitalized cooperative system as well as private farms and mills, has echoed the development across the land. With so many lives linked to coffee production, gaining a better price for a better quality of coffee seems like an obvious improvement, and few places have the potential for great quality as Burundi.
 Burundi is traditionally a wet-processed coffee, with stations often employing a two-stage fermentation method as you might find in Kenya. Their practices in coffee wet-milling are definitely good, provided they are followed. If the coffee that is selected includes unripe cherry, a good washing station will ask the farmer to sort these particular cherries out. The under-ripe coffee can still be submitted separately at some stations and often are purchased for the same price in order to avoid penalizing the farmer. (This needs to be considered in terms of quality - stations that pay on different scales based on quality of cherry selection motivates the farmer to pick better).
 Many washing stations have large concrete basins where the farmers immerse the coffee cherry, skimming off "floaters" - seeds (aka green beans) that have failed to mature. Floating the coffee cherry is a great step towards a better quality cup. In my experience the first 12-36 hour fermentation is done without water (aerobic fermentation) and the second fermentation is done under water (anaerobic), but this can vary from station to station. The washing station is perched on a slope and the coffee is washed from the first, higher tier of fermentation tanks, and on down a channel where mucilage is agitated off the coffee.  It then lands in a second strata of concrete tanks, where it is left submerged in water. Then there is one final wash as the coffee passes down a concrete channel, and is taken to either "skin drying" beds or full sun beds, where the eventual hand-picking removal of defects will take place. In Rwanda, much coffee is still "home processed" and bulked for sale as "Ordinaire" or "Ordinary Coffee". In contrast, Burundi created the Sogestal infrastructure and did not permit home processing of coffee by the farmers.
 Like Rwanda, Burundi is primarily planted in Bourbon, which is grown at high altitudes ranging from 1250 to 2000 meters. Also similar to Rwanda, smallholder farmers of Burundi tend to about 50 to 250 trees. Historically, coffee from the area was sold as bulked "Ngoma Mild" coffee (Ngoma is a traditional drum). The farmers would bring their coffee to local washing stations, which along with 20-30 other wet mills, made up the Sogestal. All of the coffee collected from the Sogestal members would be blended, and separating qualities was not possible.
 Several years ago the coffee market was "liberalized". This meant that individual washing stations could now keep coffees separate, and then market the individual lots to buyers by station, "day lots", or processing batches. With this comes the new possibility to find gems that were formerly mixed in with the not-so-good lots. So new possibilities are emerging in Burundi, and it is a coffee to watch. 
 Like Rwanda, the specter of "potato defect" haunts this coffee. It is so named for the flavor of uncooked potato found in the affected cup. It is caused primarily by a coffee-boring insect that makes a hole into the fruit on the tree and damages the green bean. The pyrazine-based compound that causes the potato taste enters the coffee fruit and binds to the green seed as a result of this damage, and it appears that other physical damage to the fruit on the tree can cause this taste as well. But farmers that manage their trees well, harvest all the ripe cherry, and do not allow cherry to fall to the ground, will have much lower incidence of potato defect.
 Our Experience in Burundi, and the Cup Characteristics
 I've made many trips to Burundi over the past few years to visit farms and cup, to participate in the national coffee competitions as a judge, to visit cooperatives and private mills.  Even still, I fell I am a relative late-comer to Burundi coffee. I see a mix of potential and great challenges here. When the coffee is good, it can easily be 88+ point coffee and pique our interest. But when it's bad...well, the coffee is no longer considered except maybe in terms of what went wrong along the way (typically bad processing, bad logistics and transport, or by politics of the coffee trade that support unsustainable practices).
 Frankly, I am surprised that Burundi coffee isn't more highly prized in the "good coffee" scene. When I started in coffee, all the "other" East Africans were considered to pale in the presence of top Kenya lots. If coffee is only about acidity, that might hold some truth. But Burundi coffees are a completely different flavor profile. A good Burundi is guilty of being balanced in acidity, flavors and mouthfeel. It's not a "showy" flavor profile, but it's the kind of coffee I consistently want to take home on the weekends to drink. It arrives fresh into our warehouse at a time when the options for Central America are flagging, and placed on a cupping table with the best Guatemala coffees it shows it's grace and subtle complexity.
 Some roasters won't take chances on Burundi (and Rwanda) coffees because of the occasional defect cup. These are fairly rare in well-processed lots, and I feel it represents a gross overreaction to a small problem: It's throwing the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. The loser is the coffee consumer who misses out on the beauty of these endlessly pleasurable coffees.   - t.o.
 Coffee was introduced into India through the Chikkamagaluru (Chikmagalur) district when the first coffee crop was grown in the Baba Budan Giri Hills during 1670 AD. According to the article "Origins of Coffee", the saint Bababudan on his pilgrimage to Mecca traveled through the seaport of Mocha, Yemen where he discovered coffee. To introduce its taste to India, he wrapped seven coffee beans around his belly and got them out of Arabia. On his return home, he planted the beans in the hills of Chikkamagaluru, which are now named Baba Budan Hills in his honor.
 India produces wet-processed and dry-processed coffees: dry-processed coffees are called "Cherry" and wet-processed arabica is called "Plantation Arabica", whereas wet-processed robusta is called "Parchment Robusta."
 The Monsooned coffee is a different story altogether! Potent, pungent, and wild, these are great for those who like strong, deep, musty flavors. Our reviews will give you an idea of what to expect.  From time to time, we also offer premium Indian Robusta for use in espresso blends on our Robusta page.
 There is some commercial production of Liberica coffee, a very tall tree-like line with softish cup character, lacking acidity, and tending to have poorly defined sweetness. Some have processed these as naturals (dry-process) or pulp naturals to try to give them a more distinct flavor.
 Harvest is generally November and February. The major coffee growing regions are Karnataka (Mysore), Kerala (Malabar), and Tamilnadu (Madras).
 Peru  has always possessed amazing potential to produce great quality coffee,  yet excellent Peruvian coffees are rare. To some degree, the success of  Peru coffee has been it's downfall. Organic certified Peru coffees are  ubiquitous, always as close as your local Trader Joe's, but the coffee  is often poorly picked, processed and roasted, if it is even freshly  roasted at all.
 We have been hard at work to establish stable relationships in Peru  to gain access to the best coffees. A great Peru is a clean,  wet-processed coffee with striking acidic brightness, a clean cup,  moderate fruit or floral hints, and good basic sweetness. The dominant  aspect is the brightness. Great Peru coffees are grown at exceptional  altitudes, often above 1800 meters, and most of the plants are old  Typica variety. So with great altitude, great Typica varieties, and  plenty of farmers to grow coffee, why is Peru not often found among  first class coffees like small-farm Southern Colombia lots, or great  1800 meter Guatemalas?
 Peru is usually the cheapest certified Organic coffee on the market,  it's the "blender" coffee of Organics; it's $4/Lb. roasted at Trader  Joes, and it is threatening to lower prices for organic coffee farmers  globally. The Peruvian coffee industry took note of the premium prices  paid for Organic coffee, and realized they could produce Organic for  less cost, focusing on quantity, not quality. They wanted to be to  organic coffee what Vietnam is to robusta. There are stories of forests  being clear-cut for organic coffee farming (it takes 3 years for an  existing farm to become certified organic... not so with a "new" farm). I  doubt the image of cutting down forests to grow organic product is the  image consumers have in mind ... then again, it's organic and it's $4  per lb. roasted. Well, you get what you pay for.
 Okay, I am a little cynical about Peruvian coffee. It's not because  there aren't good lots though. They do exist and it takes some detective  work to find them and some skill to get them out of the country in good  condition. After all, Peru is a hugely varied land and they produce a  lot of different coffees. It's the land of the Incas and by most  measures a latecomer in the modern world coffee trade.
 Peruvian offerings are hardly mentioned in William Ukers' 1936  edition of All About Coffee and have not been well thought of due to an  indelicate, blunted acidity that doesn't have the refinement of  Centrals. I think a lot of this is historical bias because Peru can  produce some very fine coffees. In general, these coffees have Central  American brightness but in a South American coffee flavor package  overall. The good organic lots do have more of a "rustic" coffee  character, but mostly because of poor processing practices. Coffees with  flavors like this might be pleasant enough, but sweetness and fruited  notes can be unstable and might fade a few months after arrival in the  US. We avoid these coffees.
 It's a lot of work to find a good lot among the abundance offered by  brokers and other channels, although they can be found. We prefer to  work in a more direct way to identify single farmers or small groups to  import, and then we work with mills and exporters to get the coffee out  intact. The journey overland, and processing facilities in the hotter  coastal zones can kill a coffee if care is not taken.
 
I have been to Peru a few times - here is the travelogue from my first  visit in 2006, and then when I acted as head judge of regional  competition in 2008 and participated as a judge on a second trip. I went  to visit the Quillabamba area more recently, and others have taken over  on the trips since then. -Tom

 For years we have thought about working in a more direct way with small-scale farmers in Guatemala, and in the 2013 harvest year this effort came to fruition.
 We're calling this "Proyecto Xinabajul" (pronounced She-nah-bah-hool), named for the ancient Mayan name for the Huehuetenango region. In this project, we have cupped many hundreds of samples to identify small producers who are producing quality coffee in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes mountains.
 Many of these coffee farmers are situated atop the high ridges and steep slopes of this dramatic landscape, but in the past they sold their coffee to the large coffee processors down in the valleys. The big farms had the prime flat lands, easy to harvest their crops, and staked out on the waterways that allowed for easy processing of the coffee. Buying these higher-altitude coffees from the surrounding small farms improved the quality of their coffee, and increased the amount they could sell to exporters.
 
View of the Cuchumatanes terrain where the small farms are located.
 But it didn't return great prices to the smallholder farms since they were now selling a raw product, coffee cherry or partially processed parchment coffee, rather than selling a more finished product direct to an exporter or buyer. When the highest grown coffees, upward from 1700 meters to near 2000 meters, were blended in bulk processing with the lower grown coffees from the valley floor, the result tended toward the lowest common denominator.
 We saw this situation as a possible win-win opportunity; for us to get better coffees with distinct cup characteristics from small farms, and for the farmer to get a consistently better price for their coffee from a buyer they knew on a first-name basis. The benefit is that we will be there in person every year, and we will consistently pay a premium for dried parchment coffee, no matter what the market basis in New York is.
 The conditions on the ground in Northern Guatemala and amongst the coffee farmer communities might come as some surprise to readers. Part of this is the result of the way coffee companies talk about their "direct trade" relationships, and the way we have discussed them in the past. As a form of marketing language and a kind of "response" to fair trade sourcing, direct trade has focused the discussion on traceability of coffee, but left many of the details vague. In some cases, the activity of the buyer doesn't really fulfill what the language of direct trade might suggest. One or two trips in a harvest season is a transient presence. In some cases the intention is to obscure that fact that direct trade involves more reliance on middle people, not less as the name suggests. In many cases, the buyer doesn't speak the language, understand the culture, or is really able to participate in a meaningful way due to time restrictions. After all, running a roasting shop takes so much focus and effort, adding more responsibilities is just not feasible.
 While these limitations of direct trade exist, the benefits of a program like Xinabajul is that we do have direct input.  We are setting parchment prices ourselves, cupping each sample down to 40 kgs (less than half a bag of coffee), mapping all the farms, and developing a hands-on understanding of the variables in quality. On that point, we are not only able to build bonds with farmers that have the best coffee deliveries, but also troubleshoot picking and processing problems with those that have potential but whose problems are showing up on our cupping table.
 
Bringing in coffee cherry in Michicoy sub-region.
 All this has involved a level of commitment on our behalf as well as those we are relying on to represent us each and every day in the area. The work in tracking and logging samples through the process, building lots for regional blends (called Michicoy, Chichimes, Canahuetes, etc) or farm-distinct micro-lots, is quite staggering. At times we are dedicating all of our lab, 3 full time cuppers, to logging, roasting and cupping for this project. We aren't done with the harvest yet, but we have clocked over 600 samples from the project here in the Oakland lab. When you consider that a specialty importer is generally looking at a few purchase options when they buy a container of coffee, each sample representing a full 300 bag delivery, you can see the substantial difference of the work we are doing to source this coffee on the cupping table alone.
 The fact that might surprise the observer, and even some well-traveled coffee buyers, is how these small farmers from a zone well-known for quality coffee, and not so off the beaten path (Finca El Injerto is 25 minutes away) have never been offered a better price for better quality coffee. They didn't even know it mattered. There was no incentive to pay great attention to picking only ripe coffee cherry, or to processing coffee with care. The coffee was sold for ready cash to "coyotes" who drive the road in trucks buying for local collectors. Or the coffee went to the larger farms in the area, blended in to increase their volumes. In each case, if a farmer picked and processed with great care, the coffee could be tossed in with a neighbor that picked half-ripe fruit, and over-fermented the coffee for 4 days. And they would be paid the same price. So there was no incentive to do better; there was neither no better price and no recognition of the effort.
 
Discussion about the current harvest with farmers from my January trip.
 This area is famously difficult for the small coffee farmer, in particular those who experience the chaotic weather patterns atop these high ridges of the Cuchumatanes. The wind and rain are noticeably more severe than the farms in the low valleys, even those within a short distance or directly below the small farms perched up on the steep slopes. There is high variability in temperature which makes for ever-changing fermentation times to break down the mucilage from the parchment layer of the coffee. Warmth and sunshine for drying are unpredictable. To manage these factors, the small farmer must be diligent, and leverage their knowledge of coffee and the local climate to obtain good results. Even some of the best farmers in the Proyecto have had bad results because of factors outside their control. In particular, unseasonable rains and cold temperatures introduced some great challenges early in the harvest this year.
 
Los Dos Jorges. The younger Jorge's coffee lots we refer to as "The Mechanic"
 In our first year of actively working the project, it is apparent that the prices we are paying for quality, and our presence and consistency in buying, has made an impact. Farmers that started out with some hesitancy because we were unknown in the zone are now delivering all of their coffee. Beyond price, we are also paying on a sliding scale based on cup quality. So once a farmer has proved they can score in the top ranks (showing not only the native potential of plant material, soil, altitude etc, but also the consistent hard work of pulping, fermenting and drying coffee according to the best methods) then they are incentivized to work with us in the future as well.
 We are terribly proud of the work we put into Proyecto Xinabajul, the work of our partners in Guatemala and the trust the farmers have shown in us. There are many fine coffees from Guatemala, but with these lots we are giving farmers access to the high specialty market to farmers who have never had it before. And for us we get to offer fantastic coffees from unique sources. It's a rewarding project, and we look forward to growing and improving it for the benefit of all.
 
Wife of one of the projects main farmers in Chichimes sub-region
 Coffee from Myanmar is not seen  often in the         US marketplace. In fact after the one offering we had from 2000,  we haven't see in since! Maybe with the recent political changes it will  reappear. The region has produced Robusta type low-grade coffee        for a while, but arabica has only been offered for the past 2  years that        I am aware of. We offer it because it is unique, has great body,  and is        very nice in darker roasts. The preparation is on par with  Brazilian dry-processed        Specialty coffees, but Myanmar doesn't really qualify as a Specialty coffee        yet in my opinion ...partly because we just don't know much about subregional        distinctions from Myanmar coffees ...And it is just too early to tell        what cup quality this origin will be capable of producing.
 Sadly, Myanmar has been under  fairly authoritarian rule until recently. There were great civil rights  questions looming in relation to the military          powers and the ruling elite. One might assume that consuming  products          from Myanmar might prolong the despotic rule, and in some cases  this might          be true. But this was the same case in Timor, where money from  the organic          coop directly aided the coffee farmers and circumvented the  occupying          Indonesian powers. The coffee we purchase from Myanmar also  comes from          a farmer cooperative called Golden Trangle, which (as in East  Timor) was          started with US AID grant money.

 Sulawesi  coffees can be the jewels of Indonesia. The reason is that some coffees  from South Sulawesi are grown at altitudes unheard of on other  Indonesian islands. The plants are older Typica cultivars or closely  related types, Jember or S-Linea. Although the system of trading the wet  coffee before final drying can damage the cup, we have been able to  work with suppliers who have mastered the elaborate coffee-collector  system in the Toraja highlands. The result is a brighter, more complex  and cleaner cup flavor. Traditionally, Sulawesi coffees have been  processed using the wet-hull method,  in the same way as other Indonesian coffees. This process determines  much of the cup flavors - the low-acidity, full body, and rustic or  earthy notes. We have been sourcing Sulawesi coffees processed a bit  differently, where the coffee is dried to a lower moisture as you might  find in Central America, and then hulled for export. This results in a  cleaner, brighter flavor in the cup, while revealing flavors that are  masked over by the wet-hull process.
 Sulawesi coffees will have a large dark-green bean, often with a very  smooth surface appearance and little silverskin (which comes off in  roasting as chaff). The cup can have moderate brightness, especially  when it is not wet-hulled, but there will be unique rustic notes even in  the cleanest flavor profile. This can be slightly herbal, greenish, or  in a bad coffee, vegetal or earthy. Sweetness is found in the best  Sulawesi coffees, but will have a rustic hue, such as raw honey, or  minimally-processed sugar like muscavado and molasses.
 The coffee was known as Celebes Kalossi; Celebes was the Dutch  colonial name for the island, and Kalossi was the old name for the  coffee market where coffee was traded. While there is coffee grown in  the southern districts near Ujung Padang, the island capital, these tend  to be poorly processed. I saw coffee being washed in what amounted to  sewer drainage ditches! There is also coffee from the area of Enrekang  as well as in the West, but the heart of coffee production is the  fascinating region of Tana Toraja. Toraja is named for the people of the  area, heralded in the past as fierce warriors and with an elaborately  rich set of cultural traditions.
 While there is coffee grown at 1100-1200 meters in Toraja, it is  possible to find 1600-1800 meter coffee in the more remote corners of  the region. Coffee is still grown on small-scale family farms, which are  best characterized as haphazardly-planted coffee shrubs conveniently  planted near the houses and along the paths. Coffee production is  clearly not a top priority, but rather a matter of supplemental income.  Livestock (water buffalo in particular) and rice farming are of a much  higher order. The side benefit of the casual nature of coffee farming is  that many of the old Typica-derived varieties of coffee are still grown  in the region.
 Each family processes their own coffee as they harvest it, and they  hold it to sell to local collectors on market day. I have seen unique  forms of processing, including a kid smooshing the coffee seed out of a  pile of coffee cherries on something akin to a wheel-less skateboard.  Most use simple hand-crank depulpers made with a bicycle crank and the  sidewall of a car tire, and with a metal-covered drum to abrade the skin  off the coffee fruit.
 Coffee is then fermented in buckets or bags for a day or so to break  down the fruity mucilage layer. It is washed and then held in clean  water buckets until market day approaches. The parchment coffee is then  dried for just a few hours before it is traded, with roughly 50%  measured moisture content. The collector buys by volume using a standard  tin can measure. The can is measured heaping full, the farmer is paid  for a level can. The difference is the profit of the collector.
 The collector then delivers coffee to a larger mill, many of which  can be seen along the road between the town of Enrekang and Rantepao in  Torajaland proper. These mills will either hull the coffee immediately  (ie. wet-hull) and lay the green bean out to dry in the sun, or they  will dry it down to about 25% moisture content and hull it. Our sources  do not do this, since it risks contaminating the green bean to remove it  from the parchment shell and lay it out to dry, completely exposed.  They dry it down to a stable moisture content around 11%, just as would  happen with wet-processed coffees coming from well-run farms in Central  America or most any part of the world. It is then bagged in a warehouse  to rest, a kind of seasoning operation to equalize moisture content.  Finally, it is hulled, graded, density-separated, hand-sorted and bagged  in hermetic sacks for export. The result is a brighter coffee, more  uniform, and with less defective beans that produce off flavors.
 There is a tendency to over-roast Sulawesi coffees. The reason is  that they don't show as much roast color and have a mottled appearance  up until 2nd crack and beyond. Don't let this make you think you have to  roast them dark (although they can be nice this way too). Great  Indonesians will be wonderful roasted just to the verge of 2nd crack. So  our opinion is to ignore the weird beans you see green, and ignore the  mottled appearance of lighter roasts, and focus on the what you get in  the cup.

 Okay, it is a continent and an island. But how do you classify Australian coffee? Well, it bears resemblance in the cup to the soft, lower-grown "Island Coffee" flavor profile, so I have stretched the description a bit out of whack. Coffee cultivation began in Australia in 1880 in earnest and continued through 1926, but was found to be generally unprofitable, and the quality of the coffee was poor. It was re-established in the early 1980's in much the same areas as the original plantations on the Eastern coast in New South Wales up to Queensland.
 Coffee is now farmed from Nimbin and Lismore, in New South Wales, to Cape York in far north Queensland where the large Skybury plantation is located. Skybury and the other larger plantations, near Mareeba on the Atherton Tablelands, are fully mechanized, but there are smaller farms where traditional hand cultivation is used.
 When coffee cultivation was restarted in the 1980s, initial plantings were based on the local cultivar Kairi Typica, as well as Bourbon, Arusha, Caturra and Blue Mountain imported from PNG. Yields were disappointing though, and unfortunately the farmers were putting yield above cup quality. Some newer cultivars have now been evaluated by QDPI and NSW Agriculture. The recommended cultivars for northern Queensland include Catuai Rojo, K7, SL6, Mundo Novo, Catuai Amarillo and Kieperson. For the cooler subtropical areas of northern NSW and southern Queensland, K7 and SL14 are preferred for warmer sites, and a local selection CRB is suitable for cooler locations. Hopefully, we will see small farms specialize in traditional cultivars in the near future.
 An Australian magazine, Bean Scene, wrote about the earlier origins of Australia's coffee farms: "Many believe, however, that coffee in Australia was first found planted on the shores of Kangaroo Point in Brisbane in 1832 – admittedly not the greatest area to grow, but according to Coffee Works in Mareeba and the Australian Government’s Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, the first. It wasn’t until the 1880s that it started to spread along the east coast and down to the fertile plateau of northern New South Wales, marking the beginning of commercial plantations in Australia.
 It was around this time Australian crops started winning medals all around Europe and a reputation for vibrant growing conditions in the country began to emerge. The market took somewhat of a financial nose-dive soon after, due to rising production costs and a lack of “coffee slaves” available to pick the beans. Australian coffee fell off the radar and the growing business lay dormant for nearly 100 years until increasing global interest started to breathe life into this industry once left for dead."
 Australian coffees are mild in general, and while there is a proliferation of small farms, the exported coffees are from larger operations. Overall, I waffle on the prospects of Australian coffee that breaks any barriers in terms of cup character. Mountain Top has certainly been my pick in blind cupping versus the northern coast coffees. Have we seen the potential of Aussie coffee, or is there more this origin can offer? The jury is still out. We have not had this origin for many years now. Vacuum packing seems to have greatly improved the quality of the cup since the long transit time from Australia can effect cup quality.
 But given the cup quality, the rather low-grown taste, and the high price, it's difficult to see the value of bringing Australia coffee to the United States.

 Tom posted a video about choosing Green Coffee for home roasting that goes over all the basics - so it might be worth a view. -Maria 
 Q: What coffee should I choose?
 A: For beginning home roasters, I  think it is best to  start with  a Green Coffee Sampler   which  gives you a range of origins and processing methods so you can  start to hone in on what you like. While the type of roast you use will  greatly influence the flavor (all coffees come with roast  recommendations on the label), origin flavor sets the parameters for the  flavors in the cup.
 Coffees produced around the world can have an incredible variety of  flavors; there are, however, some general characteristics to different  regions.  This is why we organize our coffee offerings by country, not  some other factor.
 These are only generalizations and cannot be taken as true in all  cases, especially if it's a slightly unusual processing method or  varietal!
 Q: Where do you guys get your coffee from?
A: Our coffee buyer travels to different coffee farms and mills  around the world looking for good quality coffee, and checking our  suppliers.   We buy coffee from importers who are bring in containers of  coffee,  usually buying fairly small lots, usually 40 to 60 bags from  one farm.  In many cases we have direct contact with the farm or coop  that produced the coffee.
 Q: I am looking for only organic coffees. What do you have?
 A: As mentioned above, we have a drop down menu at the top of listings on the Green Coffee Offerings  that allows you to view only those coffees that are organic, farm gate,  recommended for espresso, wet or dry processed.  In many regions,  specialty coffee comes from smaller traditional farms and farmers are  unwilling or unable to pay for organic certification. Specialty coffee  in general does not see the wholesale use of herbicides that are seen in  other crops.
 Q: Help! My favorite coffee is no longer available! What do I do?
 A:  (Tom addresses this question in the video  linked above but here are some additional notes.) This happens all the  time – mostly because we are dealing with small, specific lots of  coffee. We carry not just coffee from a specific farm, but very often a  specific cultivar (i.e. Bourbon, pacamara, etc) or picking or processing  method. These are very limited lots of coffee, sometimes just a few  bags, and often very unique, so we can sell out within a couple of  months or faster.
 When this happens, in most cases you want to look for a coffee from  the same region or a nearby region as the cultivar and climate is most  likely similar. Then consider the processing method – this will greatly  impact the flavor. A dry processed Ethiopian coffee will taste more like  a dry processed Yemen than a wet processed Ethiopian.
 All the coffee reviews are archived  so you can compare the out-of-stock coffee with coffees we currently  have in stock. Please read through the descriptions of both coffees, not  just the cupping scores. Overall score will tell you how exceptional a  coffee is but not how much you’ll like it. Here is the list of factors  to consider when searching for a comparable coffee, in order of  importance:
 1. Origin 
2. Varietal 
3. Processing 
4. Region 
5. Prime Attributes/Spider Graph 
6. Score.
  Q: I had a certain coffee in years past that I really liked– when will it be available again?
 A: The answer can be complicated. Whether or not  we will have a specific coffee again depends on many variables such as  weather, processing, shipping, and competition. Since we strive to  provide the best green coffee available, we won’t bypass an amazing  coffee we haven’t offered before. Tried and true coffees we have had  year in and year out can be good, but not at the expense of ignoring  quality and new flavors that are out there.
 Q: How long does unroasted coffee last for? 
A: The flavor of unroasted coffee is fairly stable  when stored in a cool, dry place.  Green coffee will not have a drop in  cup quality from about 6 months up to 1 year from arrival date (every  coffee we sell has an arrival date in the review).
 Q: How do I store my green coffee?
A: All green coffee beans should be kept cool and  dry at room temperature, and away from direct sunlight. The refrigerator  is too moist for green beans and the freezer is too dry. In the trade,  the general rule in terms of climate for green coffee storage is this:  if it's comfortable for you, then your coffee is happy too.
 Q: Where can I buy green, unroasted coffee?
A: Sweet Maria’s of course! : ) There are other  green coffee vendors online, and sometimes your local coffee roaster  will sell you some unroasted coffee if you ask politely.
 For more discussion of choosing coffees, you might want to check the Sweet Maria's Forum.

 Sweet  Maria's has never intended to be "Robusta Central," but we do believe  that each cultivar of coffee needs to be judged on its own merit. The  Robusta coffees we offer have attained the highest level possible in cup  score given the limitations of the species. A good robusta has  different cup characteristics from a good arabica because of the  difference in the plant material. Aside from picking and processing  defects, robustas have higher caffeine, higher levels of chlorogenic  acids, and often a lack of balance between types of acids and a lack of  sweetness. This leaves the cup harsh, bittering, and often salty in  nature. A good robusta will offset these detriments in the cup with a  taste of positive acidity and perceived sweetness.
 We offer a premium Robusta coffee selection for use in espresso  blends. Robusta coffee is the common name for Coffea Canephora, a  different species of coffee from the genus Coffea and cousin to the  higher-grown Coffea Arabica L. that is the basis for specialty coffee.  You may be interested to know that the bulk of cheap coffee in the world  is actually arabica, not robusta. Arabica accounts for 75% of the  worlds coffee production with the top 5% qualifying as specialty grade  coffee.
 The most dedicated robusta-producing regions I have been to are in  India and the plant, its blossoms and fruit are ironically more  beautiful than arabica's. The uniformly ripe and well-spaced clusters of  fruit and flowers are very attractive. The plants can easily top the  age of heirloom arabica trees, 30 to 80 years old as I have witnessed,  with massive trunks, pruned to create an orchard-like grove that can be  harvested from the shade beneath the tree. It's too bad the plant  imposes limits on the ultimate quality of the cup. This limitation, bias  against robustas by quality-minded roasters who pay better for coffee,  and the fact that Robustas trade on a different commodity index that  allows for a horrendously high number of defects in a sample, leads to a  cycle of failure for the robusta grower. What incentive is there to  invest in plant health, improve cherry selection in picking, process  with greater care, prepare the coffee to higher standards, and transport  it with care if the market doesn't reward this work with better prices?
 Yet the vast majority of Robusta produced in the world is directed  toward the bulk commercial trade, used to pump up caffeine content and  as a cheap filler in institutional coffee. Robusta simply isn't picked  and prepared to the same standards as specialty arabica coffee. And when  it is, it still has that Robusta flavor, a distinct taste that can  remind one of the last time they ordered a cup at a truck stop. In that  way, the best Robusta will never attain the refined cup flavors of a  well-prepared, high-grown arabica. I just think you reach a quality  threshold when a Robusta is picked ripe, well-processed, hand-sorted,  and transported promptly; the coffee will be "good enough" to add  positive properties to a certain style of Espresso blend. That's about  the limit of what a Robusta can do though, to not detract from the cup.
 Robusta is normally not for use in filter-drip coffee blends, except  those of the lowest order. Common robusta has hard, rubbery off flavors  due to both the plant itself, and the way it is processed without care.  That said, you might be surprised with the cup quality of some of our  premium Robusta coffees. Roasted to Full City+ or light Vienna you can  indeed brew a French Press and get a very interesting, aggressive,  pungent cup. If you like dry-process Sumatras, you might find this quite  palatable. (And people who use a dab of cream and sugar might like it  too).
 There is a core use for Robusta coffees that are picked, sorted,  processed and prepared with as much care as top grade Arabicas; this  valid use is in the 5 to 20% range in espresso blends. Robustas add  body, crema, and a distinct flavor to espresso. If you are familiar with  traditional Italian espresso you will recognize this taste. It also  aids the espresso in distinguishing itself in milk drinks. We don't rate  Robustas on the cupping scale since traditional cupping doesn't apply  on a coffee solely intended as a blend component in espresso.
 See our Blending Article for specific comments about Robusta in  Espresso Blends. Also, Robustas such as these are now being used in  filter coffee "high caffeine" blend since the caffeine levels are  doubled in Robusta over Arabica. But this really isn't something I am  going to endorse, or even investigate myself even though such brands as  ShockCoffee are doing exactly this. Also check out Nestle's description  of Robusta -interesting! Robusta has also gained favor in Europe after  the noble tradition of the large roasters to buy only arabica coffees.  This shift occurred as stable old firms started to look toward  short-term profits, and ways to cut costs to achieve good quarterly  figures for investors. The breakthrough came when it was found that the  disagreeable aspects of the robusta cup could be lessened by  steaming/soaking the coffee before roasting. It would be like starting a  decaf process, without actually following through on decaffeination of  the coffee. But this sad practice has led to an erosion of cup quality  in Europe, akin to the long, slow slide in American coffee quality that  peaked in the 1970s and gave way for the rediscovery of coffee quality  in the form of the Specialty Coffee movement.

 A  long time back we had some unique wet-process coffee offerings from the  small farms of Saint Helena. We keep this page up simply to remind  people of the unique coffee history of the island. Saint Helena is a  volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is one of the most  isolated islands in the world and is about 5 x 10 miles in size. It  currently has a population of about 4,250. The island was uninhabited  when discovered by the Portuguese in 1502. For centuries, it was an  important stopover for ships sailing to Europe from Asia and South  Africa. The British also used the island as a place of exile, most  notably for Napoleon.
 The isolation of the island and the early coffee plantings meant that  these are old Bourbon or Typica plants, and are quite genetically pure.  The altitude is better than most island coffees, and colder climates at  this latitude and altitude mean the coffee ripens more slowly on the  tree. There are many challenges though, and largest among them is a  chronic labor shortage of willing workers.
 The last time we cupped samples of Saint Helena coffee it was awful,  baggy, damaged by time and humidity. It has potential; I remember a  bright, sweet cup with floral hints. But this matters little when you  can't process the coffee and transport it without damaging the flavors.  At this point we don't have a lot of faith in their quality control. If  they will ship us old baggy coffee and think we would accept it just to  stock this limited coffee, they underestimate us. Cup quality comes  first, the rest is incidental. The coffee is available online in the UK  sometimes, but I will warn you away from this coffee as, even on a small  scale, you are risking similar poor cup quality at very high prices.

 Guatemalan coffee is arguably the crown jewel of Central America. That doesn't mean all Guatemalan coffees are good ... but it does mean that the potential on the upside, the possibility of 88+ point coffees, is greater from regions in Guatemala than its neighboring countries. Great Guatemalan coffees have a bright cup character, floral hints, clean fruited notes, moderate body, and a lingering clean aftertaste. With varying qualities, farms ranging from huge estates to tiny small-holders perched on steep slopes, and different cup characteristics from within the same micro-regions, there is much to learn to appreciate the complexity of Guatemala coffee.
 There are diverse growing regions within Guatemala that have the altitude, soil and climate conditions to produce great coffee. Antigua is home to some of the older estates in Latin American coffee, some handed down from original land grants within the same family. In Antigua you might see the best, most systematic farm management methods employed on some farms, while just over the fence a neighbors coffee receives little care, and near leafless coffee shrubs seem forlorn and abandoned. This might be due to complex land-sharing arrangements, as more and more heirs from old families must cooperate to effectively manage the family farm without a genuine interest in coffee farming. In other cases, well-educated offspring might have attended the elite Latin American agronomy schools of Zamorano in Honduras, or EARTH in Costa Rica. These farms are well prepared to increase volume, cup quality, and fight the battle against the leaf fungus Roya.
 With land values increasing and Guatemala City sprawling over an ever-wider swath of land, you see coffee farms face difficult decisions in Antigua, as well as those near the capital, such as Fraijanes, or those around Lake Atitlan. They could sell land for housing development, or for business development to serve the city, rather than farm coffee. Farms also face competition for their labor force, as more job options outside agriculture offer better salaries and (sometimes) better futures. Younger generations show less interest in coffee farming, unless it can offer better returns. While the hectares dedicated to coffee farming in Fraijanes are dropping, it seems that other areas with rising populations are holding steady at present.
 Acatenango is near Antigua and for years they were sold as "Antigua-type" coffee. Small farmers still deliver coffee or sell to coyotes (coffee-buyers who drive around in trucks paying ready cash for coffee) who deliver to mills in Antigua. There is still a premium for Antigua coffee, but this is dwindling as buyers realize that Acatenango and other nearby areas (Jocotenango, Alotenango, Patzun, Chimeltenango) all have fine coffees in their own right. Acatenango has been the epicenter of the Roya blight for the past 2 years, severely affected because of the humidity of the Pacific ocean climactic influence on this zone. Roya is the Spanish name for Rust, a leaf fungus that slowly kills the plant if left untreated. I have an in-depth article on Roya.
 Huehuetenango from the northern highlands up to the border with Mexico can be exceptional and brightly acidic. Atitlan, Fraijanes and Quiche can all produce top lots, but we have less consistent success in those areas for various reasons. We have not found good Coban coffees for years, but the potential is there. It's a humid area, which creates problem with effective drying of the coffee after wet-processing.
 We are now working in areas that really don't conform to these ANACAFE (the coffee farmers association) regional names. For the sake of expanding the search for great coffees and sharing the rewards that come with it (much higher prices at the farm level), we feel strongly that real coffee buyers need to branch out from the known farms and well-trod pathways.
 In any case, the key to a great coffee isn't in the regional demarcation, but in the characteristics specific to the coffee itself, a product of the farmer that creates it, and certain immutable factors. Is the health of the soil maintained with good agricultural practices? Is the picking done with care, excluding under-ripe and over-ripe fruits? Is the wet-process performed with diligence and consistency? Is the coffee tree a sustainable variety, or a newer over-producing hybrid?
 Political instability has often interfered with the quality of Guatemalan coffee, and more importantly, the shared success of the coffee farmer great and small. The critical issue affecting rural Guatemalans and those from the city is crime and general insecurity, much of it linked to the drug trade routes passing through the countryside, en route to the United States. But there is a dynamic and democratic process in place, and we hope to see peace and prosperity return to the countryside.
 Many of Sweet Maria's coffees from Guatemala are bought with direct contact from the farm, and prices are negotiated with the farmer per our Farm Gate Coffee program. We continue to work here on the ground in new ways; while there are well-known farms like El Injerto that garner much attention, there are also countless others capable of producing great quality, but who don't have access to the needed financing in order to improve processing or care of the trees. When all buyers crowd around a few select farms, they do not spread the benefit of the higher prices they might pay to the vast majority of farmers, many right across the valley or over the hill from popular coffee buying routes.
 Way back, I did one of my first travelogues for a trip to northern Guatemala. I have published some more recent travelogues as well, but since we take quite a few trips a year, reporting on each and every one has become both a huge job of work and not entirely necessary.
 Papua  New Guinea is often lumped in with Indonesian coffees. But it is  distinct in nearly every way. Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern half  of the island it shares with Irian Jaya, which produces only a small amount of coffee itself. It is a world away from Java or Sumatra,  geographically, culturally, and in most aspects of coffee production.  The many ethnic groups of PNG share nothing in common with the  Bahasa-speaking peoples, or the many other Indonesian groups.   And the coffee is not wet-hulled as many Indonesia coffees are; they are  wet-processed, which might sound similar in name but is remarkably  different in terms of the resulting cup flavors.
 The coffee growing areas occupy one continuous mountain chain but are  distinguished as "Eastern Highland" coffees and "Western Highland"  coffees. The Eastern area would be centered around the town of Kainantu,  and the trade of the Western area goes through the mills in Goroka,  where coffee growing is centered around Mount Hagen town.
 There are many small-holder farms in PNG that are best characterized  as "coffee gardens." A "farmer" might have 100 trees planted around  their house. It also describes the casual nature of coffee farming.  There isn't much incentive on the part of a farmer, at small or large  level, to take coffee very seriously. Why? First, in this extremely  fertile land, nearly any stick you poke in the ground will grow. Growing  crops for local sale or for home consumption is not difficult; there  isn't a food deficit in PNG and there is little need for a cash crop to  buy food with.
 Perhaps more importantly is the completely screwy economy of the  area. PNG has been described as a "mountain of gold, floating on a sea  of oil". You might also add that it is bubbling with natural gas, since  there is a 6 billion dollar pipeline project now completed. With an  ultra-rugged terrain and a lack of roads connecting these mineral rich  zones, everything is flown or helicopter-ed  around the country. The  companies investing here open their wallets to get these rich returns.
 The culture in PNG, still  very tribal in most ways, and seems to dictate the values of the people  more than economic gain. There are still frequent inter-tribal  skirmishes, and given that within a one hour drive, you might have passed  through the lands of 2 or 3 ethnic groups who don't even speak the same root language (and might have a history of conflict too), it is difficult to organize farmers here and to build trust or get cooperation.
 With the big money from multinationals floating around, everything is  lopsided. For example, a hotel room in the modest capital of Port  Moresby might set you back $600 to $800.  And in a small interior town,  which might cost $30 USD a night in Indonesia, could be $300 in PNG.
 Aside from small-holder farmers who will often sell their coffee cherry to a wet-mill, there are large plantations in PNG. The coffee  growing side of the businesses was dominated by the Carpenter Family,  who also had vast tea growing lands. They had the well-known Sigri farm  as well as some smaller ones. Lately the operation seems to have been  sold to a multi-national company. Other coffees known in the US are  basically brands, not farms. Kimel is a large farm that also buys from  surround growers and sells it under the same name.
 Some of the seedstock on Papua New Guinea is from the Jamaican Blue  Mountain variety of Typica, with the Arusha Typica varietal from  Tanzania. Some are more modern hybrids or the Indian "Kent" varietal.  There is also a lot of classic Bourbon coffee too. The main problems in  PNG come with poor coffee processing and poor dry-milling. I visited one  of the major dry mills in Goroka and they had cranked up their  mechanical dryers to get coffee shipped as quick as possible. This  created quite a bit of smoke in the process, tainting their stock of  green coffee in jute bags. Indeed everything we cupped tasted smoked.
 In small mills, the mixing of unripe coffee cherry with ripe coffee  cherry is common. Coffee is treated as it is in the commodity trade,  without separating different qualities. Much of the processing equipment  is old British type as found in Kenya; McKinnon and John Gordon, great  old stuff that can still produce great coffee. They use disc pulpers and  grade the coffee for size on the spot, and some farms even use the  Kenya two stage fermentation method. But you might often see the coffee  dried poorly, laid out on plastic sheets when the patios or drying beds  are full, and then soaked when the rains come. This coffee has such  great potential, and in the hands of those who know how to work with the  environment, the results can be stellar when everything is done right.

 Good  news, Sammy Sosa ...the Dominican produces more than mild cigars. It  has a tradition of coffee production that dates back several centuries  now. One would expect Dominican coffees hold true to the soft, mild  profile of Island coffees in general. If you like clean tasting  wet-processed coffees from Central America or Island coffees from the  Caribbean or Hawaii, Dominican coffee hold promise.
 And yet there are often problems with picking, processing and prompt  exportation of lots. The coffee is either damaged at the farm, at the  mill, or in transport. We are hoping to uncover a great source for  Dominican coffee that has a clean cup character, and have been cupping  samples that are quite brilliant lately, showing the potential is far  greater than other Caribbean coffees.
 In fact this coffee can be much more like Central American coffees  than I would have expected, with excellent sweetness and bright acidity.  We expect to see these coffees land in late July based on the crop and  export time. There have been some interesting efforts on a very small  scale to get some better results from this origin. Of special note is  the work done by Dallis Brothers coffee.
 While  Arabica was introduced at the beginning of the 1900's, Robusta coffee  is indigenous to the country, and has been a part of Ugandan life for  centuries. The variety of wild Robusta coffee still growing today in  Uganda's rain forests are thought to be some of the rarest examples of  naturally occurring coffee trees anywhere in the world. The coffee trees  are intercropped with traditional food crops and grown in the shade of  banana trees and other shade trees. In these self-sustaining conditions,  coffee is left to grow naturally, flowering on average twice a year.
 Uganda has the unfortunate circumstance of being landlocked, and  needing good relations with its neighbors to move its coffee crop to a  port city. Transportation bottlenecks can result in containers full of  steaming coffee beans stuck on the back of a truck or a dock somewhere  ...not good for quality! But in recent years the problems of unstable  East African politics and weak infrastructure seem to be improving,  judging from the excellent quality coffee coming from the Northern  Bugisu region along the Kenya border.
 Decent commercial coffee marks are the Mbale Bugisu Coffee Factory  and the Budadiri Coffee Factory - these are the names of mills where the  coffee is prepared. Good Ugandan coffees are both unique among East  African coffees and of intense character. Germany has been a strong  buyer of Ugandas arabica crop but two years ago the outrageous jump in  Java prices resulted in numerous containers appearing in the US as a  Java substitute.
 Coffees from politically unstable regions, especially East Africa,  and the 10-year civil war in Uganda, bring up ethical issues. But the  plain fact is this: coffee is a cash crop. It is grown by 300,000  small-holder farmers in Uganda. It is 95% of the Ugandan exports and  2,800,000 people rely on it for a living! Most production is Robusta,  and the prices they get are low. Arabica coffee can get a better premium  to the farmer, and of course quality also results in increased  incentive.
 I took my first trip to Uganda in late 2009, but our project did not  pan out. Each year we look for new opportunities to find really high  quality coffee in Uganda, and we have not given up yet.
  Finca Retana derives its name from Father Retana, the principal friar among the order who founded this farm a century ago. Are you expecting us to say that this coffee tastes heavenly? Because we’re not going to. Even though it does.
 We’ve been offering this coffee for many years now, but that’s nothing compared to the decades that Fernando Cofiño’s family has handled this farm. In recent years Fernando himself has spearheaded ecological sustainability and social responsibility efforts. Which again: heavenly.
 Fernando reforested over a hundred nearby acres with navel orange trees along with traditional pine. He’s also relied on old‐fashioned and unobtrusive methods in his fight against the coffee leaf rust that decimated his harvest two years ago.
 Just the very fact that Retana continues to grow low‐yielding, sweet‐tasting varieties like this is a sign of Fernando’s dedication to producing specialty coffee that’s actually special, all while retaining Antigua’s biological heritage. And that heritage means a lot to us, even if we’ve only been working with Retana for the last six of its dozens of years.
 This particular lot of Retana is a single Red Bourbon day-lot from the beginning of the harvest. We aren’t sure what made this particular lot so exceptional. We just know it’s worthy of the SMALL treatment.

 Producer: Pablo Andres Guerrero  Farm: Hacienda El Obraje  Altitude: 7545 feet  Region: Tangua, Nariño  Varietal: Caturra  Process: Washed “Super Cherry”  Roast: Light  Notes: White Grape Juice, Nectarine, Swiss Chocolate  
 This is our first year offering coffee from our newest Direct Trade partner from the Nariño region, Pablo Andres Guerrero of Hacienda El Obraje. Sr. Guerrero established his coffee farm on his family’s land in 1999 and has been making great strides in the specialty coffee world ever since.
 Today the farm is testing areas of different species and densities of shade plants. They have planted several different, highly sought after varieties of coffee as well as being engaged in ongoing experiments with wet milling, fermentation, and drying.
 This Caturra lot has gone through what Sr. Guerrero calls the “Super Cherry” process. Although it is considered a Washed process coffee, it has been subjected to a longer fermentation before drying to imbue a deeper flavor and sweetness in the bean. We believe this process has paid off and are delighted with the results.
 This lightly roasted coffee features a floral honeysuckle aroma, creamy body, and citric acidity. When brewed it has a sweet caramel and white grape juice flavor with a nectarine sweetness and a silky, Swiss chocolate finish.
  is currently backordered. You may still purchase it now but it won't ship until it becomes available again.

 It's difficult to source high scoring coffee out of Brasil which is why we are proud to offer this coffee from Jose Oliveria.  It's our first year bringing this coffee in but we are confident that it's the beginning of a long term relationship.  The Cerrado Minerio Region is one of few producing high scoring lots and is the only area in Brasil with a "Protected Geographical Indication".

    Of course you can. We strongly encourage you to grind your own coffee to achieve an optimum flavor experience but we will grind coffee on request. Select the appropriate grind in the shopping cart.
 
    All of our coffees are given a roast level that we feel brings out their best flavor. For us, roasting goes beyond color, which is why we focus more on sharing flavor profiles rather than information on the roast itself. The majority of our coffees are somewhere in the medium-light to medium roast range.
 
    We are happy to answer, neither. We've developed a way of sourcing coffee that we really believe in and that we feel, at least for us, works better than Fair Trade or Direct Trade. Madcap spends time every year visiting our producers and building relationships on the farm level. We work closely with every link in the supply-chain to ensure that quality and sustainability are top priorities. When buying coffee from farms we haven't yet visited, we use well-established organizations to assist with sourcing that are aligned with our core beliefs and interest in transparency. So in essence, our coffees are both fairly traded and directly traded, just not certified.
 
    Like all produce, coffee is seasonal. With our sights focused on quality, we purchase our coffee during harvest and only feature it while it lasts, usually about three or four months. We know it can be frustrating to fall in love with a coffee and then have it soon disappear, but think about how exciting it will be next year when its season rolls back around.
 
    Simply use the bag your coffee comes in, keeping it rolled up tightly and out of the sunlight. We encourage you to use your coffee within one month of the roast date and keep it away from the freezer. Every time you freeze your coffee a Madcap barista loses a tip.
 
    There are numerous ways to make coffee and no single way is correct. But here's some main pointers:
    1. Use filtered water. Water makes up 90% of your final product, so water quality plays a huge role.
    2. Make sure your water is between 200-205 degrees Fahrenheit. This is necessary to properly extract the awesome flavor.
    3. Grind coffee fresh right before brewing.
    4. Use roughly 10 grams of coffee for every 5 ounces of water.
    5. Have fun and drink responsibly!

 Why you'll love it: With stunning notes of hibiscus and asian pear, this coffee is tropical and complex. 
 Story of the bean: This geisha coffee contains unique flavors caused by the "natural" processing method, during which coffee beans are dried inside the fruit of the coffee cherry. Producer Roberto Brenes and his team at La Aurora farm know that the longer the beans are able to soak up the juices, the stronger the fruit notes will be, so they rest these beans inside their fruit for 45-60 days. Infused with all that sweetness and complexity, this coffee presents the vivid flavors and aromas of origin, providing a full sensory experience that transports to you to a Panamanian coffee farm.

 Ad Astra is a very heavy, dark roasted coffee, blended of high density coffees from Central America and a small amount of select coffee from Indonesia. This sort of dark roasted coffee is excellent to balance the sugars of a sweet dessert with the faint hints of bitter sweet chocolate and heavy body in this coffee.
 We were first inspired to create this blend after watching the symbol of Ad Astra rise and be placed on top of the Kansas State Capitol Building. We only offer one really dark roasted coffee and we wanted to do it right. Bitter Sweet Chocolate, smoke and utterly powerful in the cup. Excellent with milk or an Irish Whiskey.
 Our darkest blend, this cup features a dark chocolate aroma with a heavy body and smooth acidity. Dark chocolate is prominent throughout, marked by a cola-like sweetness and lingering tone of caramelized sugar.
 Due to the inherent inconsistencies of volumetric measurement, using a digital gram scale to measure your dose of coffee and water is ideal. The Bonavita Digital Scale is designed to deliver consistently precise measurements in 0.1 gram increments. Paired with a built in timer, this scale is the perfect tool to ensure a proper brew ratio at home.Dimensions:

    Uraga is the first of our limited release Ethiopian coffees that we are featuring in 2016. Uraga is located in southern Guji, which is one of the southernmost areas that produces coffee in Ethiopia. The cooperative is made up of about 1,000 members, who grow coffee in a forest with complete shade. The coffee processed at the Uraga Cooperative is over 1900 meters above sea level, with some of the coffee reaching as high as 2200 meters. These unique conditions and the remote location allow for a new coffee that we are excited to share as a small feature in our summer line-up. We found this coffee to have flavor notes of watermelon, peach, and kumquat. The flavors are bound together with delicate, floral character throughout and a dark, honey sweetness in the middle.

            When you say Honduran coffee, it hasn’t always invoked an opinion of “Hey, that’s good coffee”. But in recent years, Honduras has really begun to shine. The growing levels of support from quality-minded producers has resulted in a spike in the coffee’s potential. We’ve already seen a lot of this potential realized since we started traveling there in 2011 and working on improvement projects. We’re curious and excited to see how these projects will help improve coffee prospects in the years to come.
        
 Honduran coffee, particularly from the Santa Barbara region, has been some of the best coffee that we’ve tasted in Central America. However, this region doesn’t come without challenges. One problem we’ve experienced is premature aging due to improper drying. This is compounded by the very humid climate, which makes it technically challenging to dry a coffee slowly and evenly. 
 When Sebastian first tasted coffee from Benjamin Vallecillo, Wilmer Dubon, Margarito Herrera and Cristian Fernandez, he was blown away by the potential of these four producers from the Santa Barbara regions. The problem? Their coffees didn’t perform well by the time they arrived in Calgary. So in 2013, Sebastian returned to Santa Barbara to work with all four and subsidize the construction of new raised beds covered by plastic, called parabolic driers. We modified the sides of each structure so they could be completely opened during the day, to keep the temperature down and improve airflow, and closed at night, keeping the humidity out. We also provided the producers with GrainPro bags that hermetically seal the coffee once it has been dried to prevent it from being damaged by high humidity levels while in both the warehouse and in transport.
 This year, we have seen some excellent coffees and are confident our work will continue improve the longevity of the coffee.

 The Bella is the wool sweater of our blends -- warm, comforting, familiar. Wild and citrusy organic African paired with earthy organic Indonesian makes for a vivid and fairly complex Moka/Java blend. It seems to weather the rigors of the automatic drip machine as well. This is, perhaps, why it's our most popular blend. It is also on the darker side: nice and thick without being inelegant. Bella stands up to milk or cream well, and is easily enjoyed black.

 Heavy peony and rose flower aroma with flavors of mulberry jam, yellow tomato with that classic Kenya brightness.
 Kenyan coffees are known for their striking vibrancy and great complexity—pretty good option for the beginning of summer. Right? Right. This coffee is from one of the washing stations of the Rutuma Farmer’s Cooperative Society, which has about four thousand members in central Kenya. This coffee is also a peaberry, which means instead of two seeds forming inside the coffee cherry, only one grows and the thought is that there is more energy going to just one seed—upping the cup quality. Coffees in Kenya are graded by size, which can be parallel to cup quality but not all the time. We blind cup several coffees before deciding on tasty lots that work for us

 The first coffee that got us hooked on speciality coffee was a Yirgacheffe natural, roasted and cupped with Stephen Diedrich at his factory in Sandpoint, Idaho.  From the first intense notes of all things not coffee (berries, flowers, juice, etc.) it was clear that coffee for us would become a lifelong passion. Since then, we have moved away from Naturally processed coffees from Ethiopia, often finding them too perfume like or pungent.  This year, while cupping this lot of Idido, we were blown away with its cleanliness and complexity and it instantly reminded us of why we got into the coffee business to begin with.

 Layered with tropical fruit and black cherry flavors, Leonicio Castellon's coffee is dense, complex and jam-like.
 Another quintessence of a Farmlevel producer, Leonicio Castellon has been farming in San Luis, Honduras for 10 years. His sizable farm is just off a main road as you leave the town of San Luis. 
 This is the second year he is putting the effort into producing specialty coffee and separating all of his Catuai from the lower quality Lempira variety. Though more labor and for a lower yield, the premiums he receives for outstanding cup quality are well worth the hard work. In addition to separating his varieties he is also using less herbicides and, rather, picking the weeds in the farm by hand. 
 Last year he built his first solar drier on his farm to dry his coffee. The drier is sophisticated and going to be a perfect accompaniment to his farm. It will allow him to control the speed of his drying even more and produce repeatable results.

 It’s high time we wrote a little something about our single origin mochas at our newest location on Hawthorne.  Many people know us for our extremely limited menu at our tasting room that does not offer any syrups or additives to our beverages.  We’re passionate about showcasing single origin coffees that give credit and honor back to the producers.  When we opened our second cafe we knew it would be more of a neighborhood shop. We knew that if we were going to offer a mocha, it had to be really special.
 Since Coava started in 2008 we’ve been partnering with the folks at Cocanu, providing them with coffee to use in their chocolates. With this relationship already established it seemed like a no-brainer to partner with them for the chocolate used in our mochas and hot chocolates. With this in mind, Cocanu began manufacturing a line of single origin chocolates that is pulverized into a powder so that it can be incorporated into milk drinks without losing the qualities and unique flavor profile of the chocolate itself.
 The chocolate in Cloudforest is a 70% dark Ecuadorian chocolate that is rich and earthy with a guava sweetness. These taste notes, paired with any of our single origin espressos translate into a delicious and balanced drink that stays true to both the chocolate and coffee producers without one overshadowing the other.
 To create these mochas we melt 28 grams of shaved chocolate into the cup and mix it, by hand, into the espresso. Come see this display of craftsmanship at 2631 Hawthorne Blvd. and treat yourself to a delicious mocha.

            With its ease of use and extreme durability, the Aeropress produces a wonderfully clean, refined, and expressive brew.
          
 What the Aeropress lacks in appearance, it more than makes up for with the staggeringly clean and expressive cups of coffee it can produce. We've consistently experienced beautiful cup after cup using an Aeropress, whether in the coffee bar or on the road. A wonderful travel companion, the Aeropress is compact, lightweight, approved by TSA, and virtually indestructible (yes, we've tried). We never leave for a sourcing trip without one.

 Four cooperatives near the towns of La Libertad and Todos Santos have partnered with Slow foods USA to form a Presidium dedicated to improving the lives of the coffee farmers and the quality of the coffee they produce. This organization supports farmers growing the traditional washed Bourbon, Caturra, Typica and Pache type plants that MAKE UP this lot. The cup features notes of orange zest, caramel, and nuts for a great morning brew.

 Ever since we've been exposed to "Sugar Processed" Decafs, we've fallen in love. Ethanol is used to extract a solvent found in sugarcane, which extracts the caffeine. Definitely the gentlest non-chemical decaffeination, and to boot this is done in the same country as the coffee was produced, Colombia, also a rarity in decaffeination. Honestly, this just tastes like a really beautiful coffee from Colombia, it just happens to be Decaf.

 There’s more than one way to make a coffee. Like, totally hypothetically, let’s just say you decided to start growing coffee on a little stretch of steep‐sloped land through which the Karru Nagesso river runs. That would be totally normal. But what if the river was at the peak, not valley, of your land?
 Well, growing coffee below a river would allow you to use that river for cheap and clean irrigation without pumps and generators. In fact, you could even dig a couple trenches to flood your farm once a month in the dry season. Of course, if you did all that, you’d be doing something nobody else does; would that be cool with you?
 It’s cool with Tolemariam (“Tolu”) Jibat, who founded Goljo just a decade ago. His parents were coffee farmers, but he chose to head to town and start a few pharmacies. He seems to have picked up a lot of ideas from fruit farmers, or maybe just his own ingenious brain.
 Ethiopia, on the other hand, features the most traditional techniques of any producer. (That stands to reason, considering Ethiopia started growing coffee a few hundred years before the rest of us caught on.) Our very first batch of Goljo combines both traditions: something old, something new, something borrowed, and something to brew.

 This week we have released three coffees from Bolivia. This is a big milestone for Drop Coffee, to be able to manage and work directly with one producer and exporter in a long term relationship, where we can make a big impact. However the two superheroes for Bolivian specialty coffee is our exporter and producers Pedro and Daniela Rodriguez. Daniela and Pedro Rodriguez Our goal is just to get a tastier cup of coffee, but if we can do this and make a positive impact its a win-win situation.

 Figured we hadn't posted the video from the Nordic Roaster Forum November 2015 in Copenhagen just yet. The talk is not perfect at all, however it sums up alot about our roasting philosophy.  As said in the beginning, knowledge in coffee roasting is developing so quickly and all we can promise year after year is that we're consistently trying to create a better cup of coffee.  Giving this talk, we did not yet have a reader for exhausted temperature and currently we're looking into consistent airflow. However, the philosophy is staying the same: a coffee with a clear taste profile with a lot...
 I just placed forth in the World Coffee Roasting Championship in Shanghai, China.  Placing third in the world in the world in 2014 (Rimini) and second in the world 2015 (Gothenburg) the expectations were very high. However, this is nothing we're disappointed in at all. This is actually the best competition I've done so far. I was super happy with how I presented the single (Panama), reminding of strawberry lemonade and citric. The blend I created with 80% Santuario from Cauca since it simply was stunning; vibrant, juicy and a surgery sweetness. For the rest of the blend I was using...

 Producer: Padre José Alejandro Aguilar Posada  Farm: Finca Villa Loyola  Altitude: 6160 feet  Region: Nariño  Varietal: Caturra  Process: Washed  Roast: Light  Notes: Brown Sugar, Blood Orange, Red Plum  
 As an espresso Villa Loyola has a vibrant acidity and creamy body. Look for a red rose aroma with notes of dried apricot and swiss chocolate with a red plum sweetness.This coffee does well pulled under low pressure, making it an excellent home espresso.
 Pressure: 7 barsDose: 20 gramsYield: 27 gramsTime: 28 - 30 secondsRest: 6 - 11 days off roast 
 One of our favorite farms, Finca Villa Loyola, has been our Direct Trade partner since 2011. Following a 1st place win in the 2008 Colombia Cup of Excellence, Villa Loyola’s story has been one of impressive growth and improvement. This farm has a clear winning combination of high elevation and the lauded Caturra variety of coffee trees. These trees have been planted under a shade canopy which serves as a wind barrier, improving the sweetness and character of the coffee while providing a natural habitat for indigenous species. Over the last few years, farm manager Jose Luis Almeida has worked hand in hand with us to improve picking and processing of the coffee, further improving its quality.
 In 2012 leadership of Villa Loyola fell to Padre José Alejandro Aguilar Posada. With a worldly education received in Colombia, Brazil, Congo, and the United States, Padre Joe has extensive knowledge and experience in agro-ecology, sustainability, rural development, regional sustainability, and eco-theology. Throughout his life and travels he has been deeply involved in sustainable agricultural development and rural economics. His unique background is perfectly suited for the work at Villa Loyola. With his guidance, Villa Loyola will continue to advance its sustainable practices while improving the lives of the workers and surrounding community.Villa Loyola has been working closely with the Committee of Coffee Growers of Nariño, providing better wages and living conditions for the permanent and temporary workers on the farm. Seven hectares of the farm have been isolated by the Environment Control Center of the Department of Nariño for the cultivation of Guadua bamboo which can be used for tools by all of the farms and coffee growers in the region.We are thrilled to be working with Padre Joe and hope to collaborate with him for many years to come. 
 This lightly roasted coffee features a brown sugar aroma, creamy body, and vibrant acidity. When brewed it has notes of Swiss chocolate with a blood orange sweetness and deeply sweet red plum finish.

 Equal parts talent and luck, this Kenyan coffee hails from the southern slopes of Mt. Kenya, where conditions for coffee cultivation couldn’t be finer. Add to this one of coffee's best accidents—the diminutive peaberry—and you have a resounding cup. Many believe that the naturally occurring peaberry—where the coffee cherry produces one plump, round bean instead of two halves—doubles the flavor and sugar of the seed and is easier to roast. Year after year, Kirinyaga coffees are beloved for their ripe, fruit-forward profiles. This one, grown by smallholder farmers and processed at the Kirinyaga Factory, does not disappoint. Whether it’s the fine soil, the high elevation, or the influence of the otherworldly peaberry—this coffee sparkles. Imagine verdant kiwi, with its star-like glitter of black seeds, crossed with the tropical notes of lemongrass.

 This cold brew takes its name from the famous Zamboni ice resurfacer. The Zamboni Company has a history of innovation in keeping cold things smooth. The family started in refrigeration over 90 years ago and as the popularity of ice skating rose, Frank Zamboni shared his ice-related talent by building the Iceland skating rink in southern California in 1939; later, he introduced the world's first ice resurfacing machine. Through Frank's persistence and commitment to the industry, Zamboni has become famous all over the world.  We hope that this cold brew can achieve some of the same goals. We want you to enjoy something that tastes smooth and delicious, and cools you down fast. This blend is specifically sourced and roasted for the cold brew method. The base is a natural processed Brazil—giving it a chocolate-toffee base, while the Ethiopian component gives it a higher noted, wild, fruity element.
 To brew this coffee the way we think you should ;) you'll need to use one whole bag (12oz) to 7 cups of water. Use a coarse grind (like for a french press) and steep in cold water in the fridge for 12-14 hours. Drain the brew and cut with 50% cold filtered water. 
 Add on one of our cold brew retail bottles to store (some of) your brewed cold brew! We can't send you our brewed concentrate, but you could use this bottle and pretend like we did. Bottle also works great for using as a vase for a few flowers, storing homemade ginger beer or kombucha, or shampoo.

 Producer: Francisco, Luiz Paul, Glycia, and Sandra Pereira  Farm: Fazenda Sertáo  Altitude: 3600 - 4750 feet  Region: Carmo de Minas  Varietal: Yellow Catucai, Yellow Bourbon, Red Bourbon, Yellow Catuai  Process: Pulped Natural  Roast: Medium-Light  Notes: Milk Chocolate, Vanilla, White Peach  
 Coffee cultivation at Fazenda Sertão dates all the way back to the first stages of coffee growing in Carmo de Minas. José Isidro Pereira was practicing as a dentist until he inherited Fazenda Sertão from his mother after her passing in the late 1940's. José met his wife Nazareth shortly after and settled their family at Sertão.The farm is now managed by José and Nazareth's children: Francisco, Luiz Paulo, Glycia, and Sandra.The farmland is 270 hectare and the coffee is planted on hillsides with slopes up to 45 degrees. This is important to note as the crop can avoid frost, which are common in the region's winter months. This results in a more uniform ripening as well as providing protection against fungal infections due to the low relative humidity.

 One of the industry’s most revered professions is at risk. Service Sphere talks about its plans to reinvigorate technician training and the reason it’s in strife.
 
    There are a few careers that don’t require formal education to prove their ability, such air traffic controllers, Uber drivers, or administration staff. Now add to that list one of our industry’s most respected professions – coffee machine technicians.
 
    “There is a serious global shortage of good machine technicians,” Service Sphere’s National Business Development Manager David Burchett says. “It’s definitely a problem. With technologies advancing and trends changing, undoubtedly the future of the profession will be in serious jeopardy if we don’t take action to grow a new generation of specialised machine technicians.”
 
    David says one of the core reasons the profession isn’t attracting a strong uptake is because there’s not an industry standard, certification, or technical school to graduate from.
 
    “Trades such as an electrician, plumber, or builder require skill sets that are recognised by a formal industry body, meaning they’re more employable and sought-after by students because of their credibility,” David says. “Unlike electricians, we don’t crawl through holes and roofs, but we do navigate our way around a coffee machine, and that takes remarkable skill. Machine technician is one of those professions that needs to exist for the future of our industry. Without it...well, that’s a scary thought.”
 
    Rather than placing advertisements for a machine technician on Seek or the local newspaper, Service Sphere Service Manager Huw Harts says the company finds it easier to select passionate coffee people and train them internally.
 
    “You can have a mechanical and electronic engineering background but that doesn’t mean you’re a naturally gifted espresso machine technician. It’s about more than just having technical ability. You have to understand coffee and have a passion for it,” Huw says. “You have to know how coffee should look, how it feels, how it tastes and functions with different equipment, and how it reacts to water. There’s a lot to know.”
 
    Huw is one of Service Sphere’s 20 national service technicians who have such knowledge. He honed his skills through experience and persistence.
 
    Pre-2001 Huw worked in the catering industry in the United Kingdom before taking on service work for Electrolux, followed by CMA Macchine Per Caffè.
 
    “In catering I dealt with machines that had electrical and hydraulic circuits, which I was able to transpose onto a much smaller scale in coffee machines. Eventually I was responsible for managing 25 Version One Plus For You Astoria machines in Cyprus Airport, and all of Costa Coffee locations in Cyprus,” Huw says.
 
    With Greece’s economic downfall in 2013, Huw jumped at an invitation to travel 14,000 kilometres and work for Service Sphere in Melbourne.
 
    “I started working the day I arrived,” Huw says. “I was immediately surprised at the difference between coffee drinkers here in Australia and Europe.”
 
    Huw has been a member of the Service Sphere family for the past three years, and has serviced thousands of machines across a wide range of brands.
 
    To ensure the craft behind machine servicing remains at the forefront of our industry, he heads up Service Sphere’s Training Academy.
 
    The Academy is offering technical training courses for individuals looking at becoming an espresso machine technician, or wanting to gain a greater level of knowledge and appreciation for the functionality of coffee machines. At completion of training, attendees sit an exam and receive a certificate.
 
    “Technical training is about understanding how different machines function, learning how to diagnose faults, and how to address them correctly. It’s about improving everyone’s knowledge so more people understand the work we do and why,” Huw says. “A technician’s job is to understand cause and effect. There’s always a symptom and we need to find the cause. We need to understand the function of every machine component, what it impacts on, and how we can fix it if it fails.”

 The rare Villalobos coffee variety makes for an easy-drinking cup. A prime summer brunch sipper.
 A deep cup with sweet and savory moments. Round with notes of brown butter and root beer.

 Nine siblings make up the third-generation of the coffee-producing Torres family. They have blown us away with some of their most surprising, wonderful coffees to date. Also, sometimes when we visit, patriarch Olivier plays us music on one of his handcrafted guitars.
 The Villalobos variety was first discovered in this region in the 1950s, and the Torres’ family found it growing wild on their farm. It’s rare and we are incredibly lucky to exclusively offer this sweet, dynamic cup.
 Our top three Classic blends, arranged in a decorative gift box, are sure to please your favorite coffee drinkers.
 Corsica – a classic, beloved blend with deep, dark chocolate tones and a bold coffee flavor.
 Nizza – this blend hits at the heart of honey-sweet, roasted nuttiness. Perfect as espresso.
 Phocea – a unique blend with a roasty flavor and gentle spice, Phocea is a new coffee experience.

 b: northwest coffee roaster notoriously fueled by good folks and Led Zeppelin
 Coava began in Matt Higgins’ garage in 2008. The veteran barista and roaster bootstrapped the company by repairing motorcycles. His ambitions were to one day roast and prepare coffees that would be exciting for baristas and inviting to everyday drinkers. To do this, Matt knew that sourcing excellent "coava" would have to be the anchor of everything he did.
 So he studied agriculture, farm practices, and sustainable business. He learned from everyone that he could and at the first chance he began traveling to the major coffee growing regions. He sought farmers whose careful work was producing quality crops with the type of complexity and balance that many single origin coffees didn't have at the time. His willingness to do what others would not eventually earned him a reputation among coffee producers as a respectful, diligent, and honest man. Those early years were adventurous and difficult, but laid the foundation for the many long-standing partnerships Coava has with farmers today.
 With great coffees in hand, Coava began sharing them through a handful of Pacific Northwest coffeehouses. These early believers led the way for Coava to open our brew bar and roastery in southeast Portland in 2010. We are indebted to and thankful for their support on this journey.
 #coavainsight: The word Coava was introduced by William Biddulph to the western world in 1608 in The Travels of a Certayne Englishmen in Africa, Asia, etc... Begunne in 1600 and By Some of Them Finished-this Yeere 1608.

 Creating a blend to achieve a particular flavor profile can be very exciting. It allows us to cup samples from all over, with the goal of finding the perfect coffee, or coffees, to suit our needs. In doing so for The 1950 Blend, we seek heirloom, varietal coffees from the birthplace of coffee: Ethiopia. These coffees are some of the most nuanced, and complex coffees on the planet and can shape-shift from region to region, processing, and through roast application.
 We should apologize. For years we’ve been saying, “Our decaf is way better than it needs to be.” But really, that’s not true. It needs to be this good.
 When you want to make a statement, sometimes you have to go above and beyond, or over the top, or whatever. Our statement? Decaffeinated coffee is coffee. And coffee should be great. The coffee industry in general, and even some of the fancy coffee world, simply doesn’t care about decaf. Which sucks.
 Think about it in terms of some other produce, like apples. First a harvest of fresh and tasty apples arrive at the grocery. Eventually, the bruised and distressed apples get discounted, and then maybe dropped in a free box for the employees. Those old and ugly apples left in the free box after being discounted and even offered for free… are better than most decaf.
 This coffee, on the other hand, is the fruit of four years of direction‐asking and aimless driving up 1,500 meter mountains on the El Salvador‐Honduras border region called Chalatenango (“Chalate”). That’s where we found Los Chelazos. We brought Los Chelazos here to SF to taste, then forwarded it along for reverse osmosis decaffeination by Swiss Water Process in British Columbia.
 Because it really needs to be this good. We’re sorry.

    The Las Serranias is decaffeinated using the Natural Ethyl Acetate Method at the Descafecol plant in Manizales. Ethyl acetate is used as an extractor of the caffeine component of the coffee. Generally, this decaffeination process is performed using added chemicals. The ethyl acetate used in the Las Serranias, however, is obtained using fermented sugar cane (which naturally contains ethyl acetate), complementing the sweetness of the coffee. Rarely will one ever find a decaf coffee as sweet, complex, and enjoyable as the Las Serranias. Las Serranias is the exclusive decaf that is offered at Madcap as we are yet to find an option that comes close to comparing.

 The sweet, savory blend that started it all, and our most popular coffee. When you die and go to heaven, all the diners serve Hair Bender.
 This complex and sweet cup starts with a round, full cherry splash and finishes with warm chocolate and toffee flavors.

 Named for a long-shuttered beauty parlor that housed the first Stumptown location, Hair Bender was the very first blend that Stumptown-founder Duane Sorenson introduced to the world. In fact, we still have the Hair Bender sign in our headquarters, watching over us as we roast each batch.
 It’s our most popular coffee with good reason. A cup of Hair Bender has clarity and complexity; Indonesia’s rich textures are balanced by the classic flavors of Latin America and Africa. We use it at our cafes for espresso, but it’s great for all brew methods. 
  is back-ordered. We will ship it separately in 10 to 15 days.
 Production process: Cherries are hand sorted for unripes and overripes before they go in to production. A Penagos Eco Pulper removes the skin and pulp. The coffee soaks over night, and are washed and graded in the washing channels in to three grades based on density. After washing it is being sorted and checked for defects while parchment still is wet, before being put on the drying tables. 
 Drying: Sun dried 10 – 15 days on African drying beds on hessian cloths. Coffees are covered in plastic during midday and at night, and in case of rain.

 Sourcing at Dogwood Coffee is based on three principles: Quality, reciprocal relationships and balance. Through communication, travel and the cupping table, we find delicious coffees and awesome people to work with that mirror our philosophies about coffee and life in general.
 Quality is the driving factor behind what we do and provides expandable opportunities from the coffee farm to the brewed cup. In coffee, working for quality means access to sustainable markets and satisfaction with the work. There is little point in doing something without the drive to do it well, and in the end, we’re all interested in drinking tasty coffee.
 Relationships are fundamental to our sourcing approach. We partner with producers, exporters, importers and other sourcing pros that allow us to participate in the process and forge meaningful, longstanding relationships. We travel to the countries where coffee grows to know the places and people, and to push the process of discovery. We are not afraid to cultivate new relationships with producers who have been where we have before—trying to figure it out and do something new. Through building relationships we share in the risk of discovery and in the awesomeness of success.
 Balance runs through everything for us. Our offerings are balanced yet interesting—with wild coffees that knock your socks off and coffees you could drink all day. Balance means that we step back and try to understand what we do in a global perspective. Coffee is the livelihood of and hugely important to millions of people spanning culture and economics, but we remember that people have lives and that what happens around coffee is of equal significance.
 It is humbling to follow the process of coffee: a fruit that gets picked by hand on the other side of the world, pulped and dried, sorted and stored and sold, then put on trucks and boats to get to us. All along there are hundreds of ways something could go wrong, hundreds of factors that contribute to a delicious cup and hundreds of people intertwined. Quality, relationship and balance are on our minds as we buy coffees that help make us the company we are.
 Dogwood Coffee Company exists to support and spread the enjoyment of delicious coffee. Our participation is rooted in relationship, cultivated by discipline and grown through original expression.

 From the Gilmore Girls to Ghostbusters, this is the year of the revival. Sure, it’s not terribly original, but so what? Neil Young opening for Paul McCartney? Sure, why not? Likewise, here we are working with the Zelaya family yet again, and roasting up another incredible Guatemalan coffee.
 Luis Pedro Zelaya Aguirre and Luis Pedro Zelaya Zamora are pretty dependable guys (like Bruce Springsteen), and we’ve been working with them for years now (like Bono and The Edge). They know what we like, and that we pay for great coffee, so they’re always looking to hook us up with local producers.
 This particular coffee is one of their own‐‐it’s from Buena Vista, the farm that Luis Sr has semi‐retired to. But like Mick and Keith, his idea of retirement is pretty active. And Buena Vista just keeps improving. From the symmetrical rows of shade trees to the shrubs pruned back at the slightest hint of leaf rust, the operation is tight. Tight like the encore of a Rush concert.
 We certainly understand why Luis Sr. likes focusing on Buena Vista. All it takes is a ride up the farm’s steep slope, switchback after switchback, to get a free view of the sun setting over all of Antigua. And that’s a show that’s been on every night for years, and never, ever gets old.

 Producer: Small-Holder Farmers Farm: Highland Organic Agriculture Cooperative (HOAC), President Daniel Kinne Altitude: 5905 feet Region: Purosa / Okapa Region Varietal: Bourbon, Typica, Arusha Process: Wet-Hulled Roast: Light-Medium Notes: Sweet Pipe Tobacco, Cashew, Date
 This coffee will roast on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Orders must be placed by 4pm Central Time the day before roasting. All coffee and merchandise in your order will be produced and shipped on the same day unless you specify otherwise in the Order Notes section of your shopping cart. Please see our FAQ for more details.
 The Enorga coffee comes from the Highland Organic Agriculture Cooperative (HOAC) in remote Eastern Highlands Province of the Okapa Region of Papua New Guinea. HOAC was created in 2004 to tap into the collective voice of the quality coffee growers in Okapa. The cooperative has brought people together to discuss community issues such as poor road access, healthcare, and coffee quality. The formation of HOAC has created many benefits with some 2600 farmers working together to improve their coffee product and reinvesting the premiums into their community. Listed below are some of the community benefits HOAC has provided:
 The cooperative has purchased textbooks and desks for community schools and has provided building materials for the construction of new schools. Productive Investment  Farmers have improved their coffee quality through technical assistance programs offered by the co-op.
 The cooperative purchased new mattresses for healthcare centers in the region. 
 HOAC has improved local roads and purchased a vehicle to transport people to and from the area.
 A pleasantly spicy and citric aroma of coriander, round body, and beautifully balanced acidity. The cup features a sweet pipe tobacco note complimented by a date-like sweetness. The finish is wonderfully rich and reminiscent of cashew.
 
    Mathew Mugo’s father started his own coffee farm in 1963, and has passed it down to Mathew, who runs and operates the farm alongside his wife, Charity. The Mugo’s coffee is unique in Kenya as it is a family-owned and run estate. Most Kenyan coffee that is “directly traded” belongs to a cooperative system that partners with a management service and also partners with an exporter before the coffee is ever sold to a buyer. Mathew mills and processes his own coffee before exporting it and works directly with his buyers. To have that much control over your coffee before it leaves the country is quite rare in Kenya.

    This coffee is comprised of SL28, SL34, and Ruiru 11 varieties. Once the ripe coffee is harvested by Mugo’s team of 13 employees, it is then taken to the mill to be processed. The process is a fairly traditional Kenyan style, where the coffee is pulped, fermented for around 36 hours (depending on weather), washed in long channels, and then dried on raised beds for about 2 weeks. Through their involvement in many aspects of the production the Mugos are able to consistently provide a coffee that is a great example of a “classic” Kenyan profile with a big syrupy body, dark fruits, bright citric acidity, and complexity that dances on the tongue.

 Our latest version of Streetlevel Espresso made up of two incredible fresh crop coffees from Guatemala.
 Finca Candelaria is in the Alotenango region of Guatemala. In the past, coffees that came from Alotenango used to be labeled simply as Antigua because of its close proximity to the old town. Candelaria and other farms have created traction which has allowed for Alotenango to be seen as more than just Antigua's neighbor.
 Our stunning lot of Candelaria was hand-selected by our green coffee team by cupping through multitudes of day lots from the estate. We chose only late-harvest lots that were filled with dense stone fruit character. These lots come from the highest portion of the farm and are made up of Bourbon and Caturra varieties.
 The other component in our newest installment is a coffee called Los Santos. The coffees that make up Los Santos come from smallholder farmers in the Chimaltenango region of Central Guatemala. These farmers typically hold land between one hectare and 10 hectares. This specific region of San José Poaquil is fairly untapped, and most of the farmers have let their farms go wild. But, with immense potential, heirloom red and yellow bourbon trees and some guiding hands, the farmers are starting to receive premiums based on cup quality, which will quickly help the region's farmers understand its potential.
 Streetlevel Espresso works perfectly as your everyday espresso or as a brewed coffee. This version we have been liking pulled fast and medium in output.

 I remember the coffee from Blanca Rojas as our most elegant coffee from Colombia last year.  Cupping the coffee this year with our green coffee source for Colombia, it was tasting like sparking raspberry soda with some milk chocolate notes. We hope we can bring out some of that liveliness to the cup.  /Joanna Alm, Head roaster   Coffee production in Colombia is based on smallholders related to a cooperative or association. The growers often process the coffee themselves and then sells the parchment coffee to a cooperative. When a grower delivers his coffee it will be cupped immediately, and...
 "I’ve been longing to get this coffee home all season. It jumped off the table whilst cupping at the exporters in Kenya earlier this year. It really broadens our minds and expands the idea of what a Kenyan coffee can be. For many years we’ve been focused on blackcurrant, light characteristic coffees from Kenya whilst this one is much more mature and has plenty of mature berry notes, whilst still maintaining the acidity typical for the region."

Webcor’s team of agronomists work with the farmer associations on educating good agricultural practice but fertilizer use is a challenge connected with...
 "Coffees from Rwanda are unique in due to the tart lingonberry characteristics that we find in the cup and really stand out compared to any other other coffee producing region. When first buying coffee from this area three years ago, we were so amazed by the clean taste profile and cranberry bitterness that our barista Linnea decided to compete with the coffee ”Epiphany Muhirwa” in barista cup, where she used the coffees natural bitterness to replicate the quinine from tonic water in her signature beverage." Joanna Alm, Drop Coffee  ￼￼In Rwanda 30% of coffee produced is fully washed and exported, the...

 Simultaneously complex and intense; this coffee combines the jam-like, brambly qualities of boysenberry with the top-note florality of honeysuckle.
 The Gesha Cultivar is considered by many coffee professionals, connoisseurs, and enthusiasts to be the most intense, complex, brilliant cultivar ever discovered. Though Gesha gained its current acclaim from crops cultivated in Panama, its origin can be traced back to the fertile land on the slopes of southwest Ethiopia. From the birthplace of coffee, Gesha was transported across the world’s foremost coffee producing countries, finally landing on the shores of Central America in the 30s. Because of its unique traits from plant to cup, Gesha has built an unparalleled name for itself, and now we have access to the greatest cultivar ever discovered grown on some of the world’s greatest farms.
 "A place very far away and hard to get to", as defines the word "Jurutungo," is the name of Graciano Cruz' farm in Western Panama.
 In the seventies, Jurutungo was a freshly planted farm in western Panama near the Costa Rican border in a region called Piedra Candela. Jurutungo was planted with Catuai, Caturra and a modest hectare of the Gesha variety.
 In 2009, Graciano Cruz took over the overgrown farm and reinvigorated the land by stumping the existing trees and allowing them to regrow. The result; the rebirth of some of the world’s oldest gesha trees on one of the highest farms in Panama.
 A North American exclusive offering, Evelia Maria Natural Gesha celebrates "old-vine" character and terroir of one of the most intriguing farms we’ve come across to date.

 Here is a short version af an interview I did last month with European Coffee Trip.
 Reko is consistently one of our favorite coffees year after year, and 2016 is no exception. Beautiful rose and blackberry, a gentle but bright acidity, this is as lovely of a fresh crop Yirgacheffe you could ask for.
 Cultivar: Local Heirloom, KurumeRegion: Yirgacheffe, EthiopiaProcess: washedOur roast days are Monday and Wednesday. All coffee is roasted to order and ships one day after the day it was roasted.
 ﻿All of our coffee is now flushed with nitrogen when bagged, creating an inert atmosphere that improves freshness. An unopened bag of coffee can now retain freshness for 4+ weeks.

 Copper plated with a clear-coated interior to prevent any 
tarnishing, this elegant kettle takes a shine to any kitchen. The narrow spout allows for a slow and precise pour. 
 The Hario’s beautiful copper gooseneck spout offers even more pour 
control. Equally impressive in its beauty and performance.

 
              Nuanced and versatile, the Hario is an elegant brewer for those who want to perfect the pour. It’s great for folks who are looking for complete control over brewing extraction. The key here is to pour slow. The entire brew process for a 10oz mug takes about three minutes. 

            
 Longitude 123°W is a medium roast, created to be sweet and flavourful throughout the year, reflecting the freshest coffees of the season. 
 For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
 
            With each blend, we hope to achieve that unattainable quality, that little something extra that otherwise cannot be found in a coffee.
            
 Cupping notes : Ample-bodied, Forest floor, Licorice
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Breakfast Blend combines distinctly spicy and mildly pungent characteristics of Indo-Pacific coffees. The result is an eye opening blend that is bold yet well rounded, and profound flavors that are sure to illuminate your mornings.
 Cupping notes : Complex, Dynamic, Blueberry
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Elysian refers to a state of bliss or happiness, simply put – heavenly. The Elysian Blend can be characterized as a very rich, full bodied blend with a lot of depth and complexity in flavor. This makes it a good after dinner coffee to enjoy with dessert.
 Cupping notes : Deep Smokiness, Browned Butter, Caramel
Roast level : DARK
 We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as baker’s chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.
 Cupping notes : Smooth smoke, Caramelized sugar, Silky body
Roast level : DARK
 This is our darkest Fair Trade/Organic certified blend. We thoughtfully selected the coffees that make up this blend in order to maintain some of their individual aroma and flavor attributes while standing up to the intensity of the unique way that we roast them. The result is a dark roasted coffee with sweetly smoky flavor, light body and just a glimmer of lemony citrus notes; a perfect way to ease into your morning and a great complement to an evening meal.
 Cupping notes : Chocolate, Caramel, Butterscotch
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Whether approaching by sea or from within the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Strait imbues a sense of magic and wonder. The stunning landscapes and picture perfect sunsets inspired us here at Mr. Espresso to create a blend that attempts to capture its grace and majesty. Dark chocolate, sweet caramel and fruit toned acidity seamlessly blend together to create our homage to this wonder of nature.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 There are seven bridges that keep the people of the Bay Area connected, and the Seven Bridges Blend pays homage to the diversity of people and tastes in the San Francisco Bay Area.
 A blend of Fair Trade and organic certified coffees, the Seven Bridges Blend is a velvety bodied blend with depth and a complex, multilayer flavor dynamic. A favorite among customers and chefs alike, this blend can be found at some of the finest dining establishments around the San Francisco Bay Area.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Silky, Subtle fruit tones
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Countless cafés along the Viennese streets have loaned out their tables to some of the finest thinkers of our time and some of the greatest works of art, politics and philosophy found their inspiration accompanied by a rich cup of coffee. Here at Mr. Espresso we took inspiration from this legacy of creativity when we came up with our Viennese Blend. A combination of our finest dark and light roasted Latin American coffees come together to create a rich, smoky cup with low toned fruit notes and a silky mouth feel.
 Cupping notes : Sweet Chocolate, Vanilla, Cherry
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Named after the restaurant that Carlo’s brother Franco Di Ruocco owned, Ristorante Villanova (Oakland circa 1980) – and the house blend that was served there. Its mild intensity embodies the essential characteristics of a classic American roast, yet reflects our passion for traditional, wood fired roasting. The Villanova House Blend is sweet enough to serve as a dessert coffee and mild enough to enjoy throughout the day.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Smoky, Low-toned acidity
Roast level : DARK
 The choice to use water processed decaf coffees for our Decaffeinated French Roast was necessitated by our desire to deliver our customers a delicious dark roast without caffeine or compromise. A silky mouthfeel and low-toned acidity enables the rich smoky flavor to linger without interruption through the long, resonant finish.
 Cupping notes : Smooth, Well balanced, Medium body
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 This is a blend of water processed decaffeinated Latin American coffees combining to make a smooth, full flavored coffee with medium body and well balanced acidity.
 Cupping notes : Caramelized sugar, Fruit notes, Silky mouth feel
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 This is a blend of African and Indonesian beans decaffeinated by a water process developed in Switzerland, which is considered the most natural method of decaffeinating coffee. Decaffeinated Elysian Blend is a hearty and full flavored blend, which is most unusual of water processed coffees.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Modeled after our Organic Seven Bridges Blend, this coffee has all the positive characteristics of the Organic Seven Bridges Blend without the caffeine. A good alternative for after dinner enjoyment or simply for those who are caffeine sensitive. The coffee is 99.9% caffeine free.

    We've been proudly featuring Fair Trade/Organic coffees since 1999 and throughout that time we've developed longstanding relationships with a number of co-ops that provide us with exemplary coffee year after year.
            
 Cupping notes : Sweet-smoky, Tamarind, Layered
Roast level : DARK
 Our Organic Colombia Tolima comes from the municipality of Planadas in the southern tip of the Tolima Province. Lying in the foothills of the Central Andes, Tolima is known for its mineral-rich soils and fresh water. Though relatively unknown in the coffee industry until recently, Tolima is now the country’s third largest coffee producer and is increasingly being recognized for producing great tasting coffee.
 The beans in this lot come from two small cooperatives in Planadas: ASOPAP and Resguardo Indígena Nasa We’sx.
 The 29 members of the ASOPAP cooperative are fully committed to quality coffee and organic standards from their farms, which are situated at 5,400-6,200 feet. Their beans have yielded excellent cup profiles for some time, drawing attention from international coffee traders.
 The Nasa We’sx are an indigenous community brought to Planadas in the early 1900s by the Colombian Army as a mine workforce. For decades, they were caught in the conflict between the army and the largest guerilla group in the country, FARC, until recently, when they made a peace pact with local guerrillas.
 Cupping notes : Smooth smoke,  Caramelized sugar, Silky body
Roast level : DARK
 This is our darkest Fair Trade/Organic certified blend. We thoughtfully selected the coffees that make up this blend in order to maintain some of their individual aroma and flavor attributes while standing up to the intensity of the unique way that we roast them. The result is a dark roasted coffee with smoky flavor, peppery body and just a hint of caramelized sugars ; a perfect way to ease into your morning and a great complement to an evening meal.
 Cupping notes : Sweet Chocolate, Sweet Caramel, Fruit toned acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Originally created as the companion to our Golden Gate House Blend, this espresso has a sweet chocolate flavor complimented by notes of fruit and caramel along with a well balanced acidity. It is a harmonious blend of Fair Trade and Organic certified coffees.
 Cupping notes : Chocolate, Sweet Caramel, Fruit toned acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Whether approaching by sea or from within the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Strait imbues a sense of magic and wonder. The stunning landscapes and picture perfect sunsets inspired us here at Mr. Espresso to create a blend that attempts to capture its grace and majesty. Dark chocolate, sweet caramel and fruit toned acidity seamlessly blend together to create our homage to this wonder of nature.
 Cupping notes : Strawberry jam, Milk chocolate, Currant
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Guaya’b is a cooperative of over 300 indigenous Mayan and Quichua farming families in the region of Jacaltenango, Huehuetenango. Since the introduction of coffee into the Jacaltenango region 40 years ago natural habitats, flora and fauna have slowly made a comeback from the once de-forested land. The recreation of the natural habitat has allowed for the reduction of soil erosion, restored natural habits and given the coffee crops a lush canopy that allows them to ripen slowly. Rich & delicately fruity; you’ll experience a thought provoking brew that begins with a chewy, chocolaty body that develops into a strawberry jaminess infused with deeper, bright fruit tones that suggest currant and raspberry.
 Cupping notes : Red danjou pear, Raspberry honey, Malt-like body
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Situated deep in the interior folds of the Southern Sierra Madre Mountains in Chiapas, Mexico is the coffee growing cooperative of Ramal Santa Cruz. Among this multitude of coffee farms lies the home of Augustin Sanchez Espinoza and his three brothers who all farm together on adjacent parcels of land. The farms of the Brothers Sanchez are at the upper reaches of viable coffee cultivation, starting at 1600 meters and topping at just over 1800 meters, the highest of all coffee grown in the cooperative. The family began planting coffee on the land in the early 1970s. Many of the original plants are still producing. The majority of the coffee is Typica and Bourbon with a scattering of more recently planted Caturra.
 The coffee from these four brothers and their farms make up our Mexico Fair Trade, Organic, Ramal Santa Cruz , Cuatro Hermanos.  This coffee greets you with a  red danjou pear citrus acidity followed with hints of raspberry honey and Meyer lemon.  We hope you will enjoy this extraordinarily smooth coffee from the Cuatro Hermanos.
 Cupping notes : Rich chocolate, Hazelnut, Mellow acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Our goal with Organic Neapolitan was to create an espresso blend that contained similar attributes as our conventional Neapolitan using only coffees that are Fair Trade certified and grown without the use of agrichemicals. Complex, intense and rich in both flavor and aroma, Organic Neapolitan Espresso is the perfect balance of taste and social responsibility.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK

 The challenge in creating a blend that reflects the ideal characteristics of a truly delicious espresso is too often compounded by the availability and quality of the decaffeinated coffees on the market. Organic Decaffeinated Espresso is a challenge met. Thick, golden cremaand cocoa-caramel aromatics that follow through into the cup with distinct, yet subtle fruit notes. Perfectly balanced in milk drinks and alive with flavor as a straight shot.

            A rose hip aroma, flavors of chocolate wafer, nutella, and sun dried stone fruits, with a soft, juicy satsuma acidity.
              Whole Bean, 8oz

 A Sightglass favorite, Yetatebe has been decaffeinated through a 100% chemical-free decaffeination process developed by the industry leaders at Swiss Water in Vancouver, BC. Green beans are soaked in near boiling water, extracting the flavor oils and caffeine from the coffee. The water is separated into a tank where it is forced through activated charcoal filters and stirred around in hot water to remove the caffeine. The coffee beans are then returned to reabsorb the remaining liquid and flavor. Swiss Water Process removes 99.9% of the caffeine in the coffee while retaining the coffee’s unique flavor.

 One of our signature blends, the Benchmark is cultivated to be equally delicious as brewed coffee as it is pulled as espresso. The components of this rich blend are selected for their ability to stand up to a deeper roast profile. With a more developed roast we are able to pull out deep notes of dark chocolate, molasses and toasted nuts. We created Benchmark to satisfy those customers looking for a rich, smooth, balanced and robust coffee.
 All orders are roasted on Monday and Thursday and are shipped on the same day. Note that if you order Two-Day Shipping after 7am on any given day, your order will be processed *the following roast day*. We do this to ensure your coffee arrives to you as fresh as possible!
 All coffee is delivered whole bean. If you need your order ground, please specify your brew method in the special instructions section.

 The Cadillac of Baratza grinders, the Vario holds your espresso portafilter and remembers everything but your name. Recommended for espresso.
 We love Baratza grinders because of their quality, consistency and customer support track record–these grinders are repairable and meant to last. The Vario is the top shelf luxury model with its ceramic conical burrs and easy customization.

 
              When people ask us about better brewing tips, getting the grind right is always at the top of our suggestion list. Read more.

            
 Make perfect cold brew at home. Seriously caffeinated and super delicious.
 We love the Filtron because it’s easy to use, consistent and makes a big batch of cold brew concentrate. The initial brew takes 12-24 hours, but you’ll be energetically thanking yourself for it later.

 
              There’s nothing better than cold brewed coffee on a hot summer day – or if you’re like us, any day, really. Cold Brew coffee is naturally smooth and sweet and less acidic than coffee brewed with hot water. The Filtron Cold Water Brewer is a simple way to make several cups  of cold brew concentrate. Cold brewing takes between 12 – 24 hours (we recommend 16) but the payoff is huge. This batch should keep you buzzing for days. We recommend a ratio of 1:2 coffee concentrate to water over ice, adjusting to taste.

            
 
              Some of our fave Portland chefs dish on how to use Cold Brew in the kitchen.

 This delightful smaller sibling to the larger Chemex is perfect for the 1 cup at a time kind of person. With its deeper and more exaggerated cone shape, we find grinding finer than the larger Chemex works really well with this little brewer.

 Why You'll Love It: Unique, high-altitude growing conditions and slow-drying during processing infuse this coffee with bright, balanced fruit flavors.Story of The Bean: The mountains of Huehuetenango (way-way-te-nan-go) in the Western Highlands of Guatemala are known for exceptionally high-quality coffee.  Dry, hot winds blowing from southern Mexico protect the coffee plants from frost at night, allowing the beans to mature more slowly and soak up more of the cherry fruit. This is what gives the coffee its sweet flavor.   After the beans have been removed from their fruit, they are laid out to dry. Deviating from common practices, producers in Huehuetenango stack the beans so that they'll dry slower. Because some of coffee fruit remains on the bean while they dry, they take on unmistakable raisin and melon notes. A smooth, fruity coffee to brighten up mornings.

            When you say Honduran coffee, it hasn’t always invoked an opinion of “Hey, that’s good coffee”. But in recent years, Honduras has really begun to shine. The growing levels of support from quality-minded producers has resulted in a spike in the coffee’s potential. We’ve already seen a lot of this potential realized since we started traveling there in 2011 and working on improvement projects. We’re curious and excited to see how these projects will help improve coffee prospects in the years to come.
        
 Honduran coffee, particularly from the Santa Barbara region, has been some of the best coffee that we’ve tasted in Central America. However, this region doesn’t come without challenges. One problem we’ve experienced is premature aging due to improper drying. This is compounded by the very humid climate, which makes it technically challenging to dry a coffee slowly and evenly. 
 When Sebastian first tasted coffee from Benjamin Vallecillo, Wilmer Dubon, Margarito Herrera and Cristian Fernandez, he was blown away by the potential of these four producers from the Santa Barbara regions. The problem? Their coffees didn’t perform well by the time they arrived in Calgary. So in 2013, Sebastian returned to Santa Barbara to work with all four and subsidize the construction of new raised beds covered by plastic, called parabolic driers. We modified the sides of each structure so they could be completely opened during the day, to keep the temperature down and improve airflow, and closed at night, keeping the humidity out. We also provided the producers with GrainPro bags that hermetically seal the coffee once it has been dried to prevent it from being damaged by high humidity levels while in both the warehouse and in transport.
 This year, we have seen some excellent coffees and are confident our work will continue improve the longevity of the coffee.

 Siphon coffee was invented in the 1840s more or less simultaneously by a French housewife and Scottish marine engineer. It’s been refined many times, but a few principles hold true: It produces a delicate, tea-like cup of coffee; it can be quite persnickety; and it is, for our money, one of the coolest brew methods available.

 After soaking your filter in a warm water bath for at least five minutes, drop it into the bottom of your siphon’s top component, or “hopper,” and hook to the bottom of the hopper’s glass tubing.
 Fill your siphon’s bottom component, or “bulb,” with 300 grams of hot water (about a 12-oz. cup’s worth).
 Insert the hopper, filter and all, into the bulb. You don't have to press too hard; just make sure it's securely and evenly in place. Position the entire assembly above your heat source.
 While the water is heating, measure out between 20-25 grams of coffee and grind it just little bit finer than you would for regular drip coffee.
 Soon, the water in the bulb will begin boiling and rise up into the hopper. For some physics-related reason we don’t fully understand, a little bit will stay in the bottom. Don’t worry about this little bit.
 Once the water has moved into the hopper, turn your heat source down so that the water is between 185-195 degrees F.
 Add your coffee, and gently (but thoroughly) submerge it with a bamboo paddle or butter knife.
 Let the coffee brew, undisturbed, for one minute and 10 seconds.
 In one brisk motion, remove your siphon from its heat source and give it ten stirs with a bamboo paddle.
 Your coffee should take another minute or so to draw downward and finally rest in the bulb. You'll know it's ready when a dome of grounds has formed at the top of the filter, and when the coffee at the bottom has begun to bubble at approximately the pace and strength of a kitten’s heartbeat. Remove the hopper and serve. In order to guarantee the most complex cup, give the coffee a few minutes to cool.

 Red Plum / Tarragon / Prosecco
 The Highlands of Papua New Guinea are stocked with challenges toward quality coffee production. Due to the immense diversity of indigenous tribes, many of which had no interaction with the western world until the 1930’s, there are over 800 distinct languages spoken throughout the country. The majority of mills that still operate were originally installed on massive commodity grade plantations in the 1920’s with seeds from Jamaica’s Blue Mountain. Today, 85% of coffee is grown by smallholder farmers, each owning anywhere between just a couple to a couple hundred trees.
 Kunjin operates a mill they lease on one of the original 15 coffee plantations, but purchases cherry from substance farmers in the Waghi Valley. They are able to control quality throughout the milling process, cupping day lots and building micro lot level containers to be processed separately.
 Kunjin is a beautifully complex and dynamic. Ripe plum initially comes to the forefront, offset by lime zest and a bouquet of sweet herbs. As it cools, the cup maintains its liveliness and picks up notes of white grape, coming together into a beautiful winey finish. This coffee is the highest quality lot we have seen from PNG, if not all of the Asian-Pacific region, and just may reshape your impression of the region. It is the perfect coffee for pairing with buttery pastries, whether sweet or savory.

    Blending coffee is science and artistry working in perfect harmony. Each single origin carries a distinct flavor, but when infused together, creates a new drinking experience. When the right combination is achieved, the complex blend is better than the sum of its parts. 
    
    On that note, we're excited to introduce our newest blend. This three bean blend from Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda presents deep flavors of lemon blossom, grapefruit, lychee and blackberry mixed in a balanced cup "Out of Africa".

 Characterized by citrus fruit and subtle berries, Layo Teraga beams with a vibrant acidity and delicate complexity.
 Three hours southeast of Yirgacheffe in the Oromia region of Southern Ethiopia, Uraga is a special woreda that serves as home to the Layo Teraga cooperative. Run by some of the most animated and enthusiastic people we came across during recent Ethiopia travels, it comes as no surprise that this coffee sings with complexity and character every time it lands on our cupping table.
 The Layo Teraga Cooperative is supplied by approximately 500 member smallholder farmers scattered about the staggering altitudes found in Uraga. Ripe coffee cherries are disk-pulped and fermented for 48 hours before dried on raised beds. One of the hallmarks of great Ethiopian coffees, it is to this thorough process that coffees like Layo Teraga owe their cleanliness and delicate complexity.
 Layo Teraga is located in a more arid climate than its neighbor Yirgacheffee. While arid, the area is loaded with semi-forested areas which allow for ample shade to give the trees respite from the sun. These attributes head led to an extremely dynamic flavor profile.

 Producer: Rigoberto HerreraFarm: Granja La EsperanzaAltitude: 6380 feetRegion: Valle del CaucaVarietal: GeshaProcess: WashedRoast: Very LightNotes: Chamomile, Mango, Honey
 Nearly a century old, Café Granja La Esperanza has taken great strides under Rigoberto Herrera’s leadership and forward-thinking vision. In the last decade, the farm has diverged from the traditional “C” market coffees to the more delicate and exquisite varieties coveted by the specialty coffee industry, including Gesha.
 Those ten years of experimentation, education, and great effort culminated in a Triple Crown; they won 2nd, 3rd, and 7th place at the 2012 SCAA Best Coffee of the Year.
 The trees grow in a unique landscape on the farm, on an elevated foothill between two mountain faces by the Pacific Ocean. The windward side receives a warm, mineral rich sea breeze while the leeward side rises over the Valle del Cauca and gives the valley intermittently cloudy weather. Being located between these two faces exposes the trees to fog at sunrise and sunset, with strong equatorial sun in the afternoon. The plentiful rain and rich volcanic soil provide conditions for the Gesha berries to reach optimal levels of sugar.
 The Gesha (or Geisha) is a rare coffee tree variety believed to have originated in the town of Gesha, Ethiopia. The flavor of coffee this tree produces is considered by many to be some of the best in the world. However, the spelling of the variety has left some with confusion. 
 Since the variety originated from the town of Gesha in Ethiopia, some producers of the rare variety prefer to spell it in this manner. Others producers, primarily in Panama, have adopted a slight variation on the spelling - "Geisha," which has been widely accepted as correct. At PT's Coffee, instead of taking a stand on the "correct" spelling, we are looking to the coffee producers for their opinion. We spelled the coffee the way the producers have chosen to spell it. Both are commonly accepted and, since spelling in Ethiopia is phonetic, either one could be accepted as correct.
 This delicately roasted coffee features a chamomile and citrus aroma, a syrupy body, and sparkling acidity. When brewed it has notes of ripe mango with a honey sweetness and hints of passion fruit in the finish.

 With notes of tropical fruit and blackcurrant, this coffee exhibits many of the hallmark characteristics of a Santa Barbara Honduran.
 An aptitude for growing coffee runs in the Benitez family. With a family involved in coffee for generations; Juan and his brother own neighboring small-farms in the Cielito region of the Santa Barbara mountainside where their Pacas trees thrive. 
 Benitez employs traditional processing methods compared to rural Honduran standards. Upon de-pulping his coffee into a tile-lined tub, it undergoes a dry fermentation for 24 hours until the mucilage begins separating from the parchment. Coffee is then washed and dried on raised beds in a greenhouse before being delivered to Beneficio San Vicente for trial and dry-milling..

            Complex and vibrant, showcasing flavors of honey and black currant, with a clean citrus acidity and a lingering green grape finish.
              Whole Bean, 8oz

 Maximino Gutierrez owns and operates Finca Las Florestales, a beautiful farm situated deep in the mountains of Herrera, Tolima. He cultivates 100% Caturra trees on his land, and has been investing in upgrading his equipment year after year. This constant drive to work with his coffee with more respect and care makes his coffee one of the most special in the world. Finca Las Florestales is one of Sightglass’ favorite coffees, and we are excited to share Maximino’s coffee with you.

 Since our first visit in 2011, Colombia remains one of our favorite countries to visit and source coffee from. We’ve cultivated some of our dearest producer relationships here, and are consistently blown away by the tremendous quality of coffees and people we’ve encountered in this ruggedly gorgeous country. 
 Maximino Gutierrez was one of the first producers we were fortunate enough to work with, and has remained one of our most cherished producers and friends. He produces some of the most exceptional Colombian coffees we’ve tasted on his small, but immaculate Finca Las Florestales, a multi-generational family farm owned and operated by Maximino alongside his brothers and sons. Together, they grow 100% Caturra variety on their adjacent farms, at altitudes ranging from 1600-1800 masl in the Herrera region of Tolima. The trek to his farm (and export of coffees from it) is no small undertaking as it’s tucked away deep in the mountains of Herrera. We remember first stepping foot on his farm - the sky was the most piercing shade of blue, birds were chirping, all was peaceful. The landscape here lush and rugged, punctuated by heavily forested mountains and vibrant, sweet-smelling flowers - the farm’s namesake.
 Like most of Colombia's small production farmers, Maximino wet-processes his coffees, using a cherry depulper to remove the fruit from the seed, and then fermenting the coffee overnight. When we first met Maximo, coffees were spread out to dry on the top of his house. Coffees are now dried on impressive drying beds adjacent to his home – just one example of the great care and investment Maximino has employed in enhancing his equipment and production methods.
 Each trip to visit Finca Florestales, Maximino and his family is a reaffirming experience. We couldn’t feel more fortunate to do the work that we love with the beautiful people across the world we share it with.

 Producer: Lori Obra  Farm: Rusty’s Hawaiian  Altitude: 1600 - 2100 feet  Region: Ka’u  Varietal: Typica  Process: Kenya Process  Roast: Light  Notes: White Grape, Yellow Peach, Vanilla Cream
 This micro-lot of from Rusty’s Hawaiian has been a customer favorite for the past several years. Typica is the most common coffee variety planted in Hawaii. When grown in the rich soil and cool climate of the Mauna Loa volcano’s southern slope, it takes on characteristics of the Big Island’s Ka’u District and consistently rank high in international coffee competitions. Lorie has further enhanced the flavor notes found in these high quality beans by processing them in the Kenya Method. This involves a double fermentation in fresh, cold spring water and slow-drying the parchment on raised, screen beds in the sun. The result is high scoring coffee that has made quite a name for itself.In 2010, farm owner Lorie Obra was recognized as Outstanding Producer by the Specialty Coffee Association of Europe while Rusty’s Hawaiian Yellow Caturra Natural garnered a 95-point score from Coffee Review and was awarded Grand Champion of the Hawaii Coffee Association’s cupping competition. In 2011, Rusty's Hawaiian repeated and won the competition again. That same year champion barista Pete Licata, formerly of PT’s Coffee Roasting Co., worked with Rusty's Hawaiian to develop his competition espresso blend using the Yellow Caturra Natural. The coffee helped Pete to win 1st place in the United States Barista Competition and 2nd place in the World Championship in Bogota, Colombia.
 Rusty and Lorie Obra started their famous coffee farm on the Big Island of Hawaii in the Ka'u region in 1999 on a small parcel of land near the Mauna Loa volcano. Rusty, a retired chemist, and Lorie, a former medical technologist, both had backgrounds in science, which contributed to the overall quality produced on the farm. They started testing different processing methods to get the best flavors out of each variety grown on the farm. Hawaii has long been famous for coffee grown in the Kona region. Rusty had always dreamed of making coffee from the Ka'u region some of the best in the world.
 In 2006, Lorie was left at a crossroads; Rusty had been diagnosed with lung cancer and passed away shortly thereafter. Lorie was left with the difficult decision to either sell the farm or try to run it herself. Faced with the daunting decision, she could not let go of Rusty's dream: to make Ka'u coffee some of the best in the world. Lorie's determination and hard work allowed Rusty's dream, and hers, to be realized in 2007. Rusty's Hawaiian placed in the top 10 of the Specialty Coffee Association of America's top 10 coffees for Hawaii / Asia / Indonesia regional competition. Miguel Meza noticed the success in the region, and could see the potential in Ka'u coffee. He moved to Hawaii and became a coffee consultant for the Ka'u Coffee Growers Cooperative. His guidance and encouragement helped Lorie refine her processing and experimentation.
 Lorie is now recognized as one of the leading innovators and producers in the coffee world, making Rusty's Hawaiian one of the most decorated award winners over the last few years.
 This highly sought after cup features a floral aroma with hints of caramel and grape, a silky body, and bright acidity. A delicate note of white grape is complimented by a yellow peach sweetness with vanilla cream and candied almonds in the finish.

            With each blend, we hope to achieve that unattainable quality, that little something extra that otherwise cannot be found in a coffee.
            
 Cupping notes : Ample-bodied, Forest floor, Licorice
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Breakfast Blend combines distinctly spicy and mildly pungent characteristics of Indo-Pacific coffees. The result is an eye opening blend that is bold yet well rounded, and profound flavors that are sure to illuminate your mornings.
 Cupping notes : Complex, Dynamic, Blueberry
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Elysian refers to a state of bliss or happiness, simply put – heavenly. The Elysian Blend can be characterized as a very rich, full bodied blend with a lot of depth and complexity in flavor. This makes it a good after dinner coffee to enjoy with dessert.
 Cupping notes : Deep Smokiness, Browned Butter, Caramel
Roast level : DARK
 We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as baker’s chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.
 Cupping notes : Smooth smoke, Caramelized sugar, Silky body
Roast level : DARK
 This is our darkest Fair Trade/Organic certified blend. We thoughtfully selected the coffees that make up this blend in order to maintain some of their individual aroma and flavor attributes while standing up to the intensity of the unique way that we roast them. The result is a dark roasted coffee with sweetly smoky flavor, light body and just a glimmer of lemony citrus notes; a perfect way to ease into your morning and a great complement to an evening meal.
 Cupping notes : Chocolate, Caramel, Butterscotch
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Whether approaching by sea or from within the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Strait imbues a sense of magic and wonder. The stunning landscapes and picture perfect sunsets inspired us here at Mr. Espresso to create a blend that attempts to capture its grace and majesty. Dark chocolate, sweet caramel and fruit toned acidity seamlessly blend together to create our homage to this wonder of nature.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 There are seven bridges that keep the people of the Bay Area connected, and the Seven Bridges Blend pays homage to the diversity of people and tastes in the San Francisco Bay Area.
 A blend of Fair Trade and organic certified coffees, the Seven Bridges Blend is a velvety bodied blend with depth and a complex, multilayer flavor dynamic. A favorite among customers and chefs alike, this blend can be found at some of the finest dining establishments around the San Francisco Bay Area.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Silky, Subtle fruit tones
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Countless cafés along the Viennese streets have loaned out their tables to some of the finest thinkers of our time and some of the greatest works of art, politics and philosophy found their inspiration accompanied by a rich cup of coffee. Here at Mr. Espresso we took inspiration from this legacy of creativity when we came up with our Viennese Blend. A combination of our finest dark and light roasted Latin American coffees come together to create a rich, smoky cup with low toned fruit notes and a silky mouth feel.
 Cupping notes : Sweet Chocolate, Vanilla, Cherry
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Named after the restaurant that Carlo’s brother Franco Di Ruocco owned, Ristorante Villanova (Oakland circa 1980) – and the house blend that was served there. Its mild intensity embodies the essential characteristics of a classic American roast, yet reflects our passion for traditional, wood fired roasting. The Villanova House Blend is sweet enough to serve as a dessert coffee and mild enough to enjoy throughout the day.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Smoky, Low-toned acidity
Roast level : DARK
 The choice to use water processed decaf coffees for our Decaffeinated French Roast was necessitated by our desire to deliver our customers a delicious dark roast without caffeine or compromise. A silky mouthfeel and low-toned acidity enables the rich smoky flavor to linger without interruption through the long, resonant finish.
 Cupping notes : Smooth, Well balanced, Medium body
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 This is a blend of water processed decaffeinated Latin American coffees combining to make a smooth, full flavored coffee with medium body and well balanced acidity.
 Cupping notes : Caramelized sugar, Fruit notes, Silky mouth feel
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 This is a blend of African and Indonesian beans decaffeinated by a water process developed in Switzerland, which is considered the most natural method of decaffeinating coffee. Decaffeinated Elysian Blend is a hearty and full flavored blend, which is most unusual of water processed coffees.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Modeled after our Organic Seven Bridges Blend, this coffee has all the positive characteristics of the Organic Seven Bridges Blend without the caffeine. A good alternative for after dinner enjoyment or simply for those who are caffeine sensitive. The coffee is 99.9% caffeine free.

 This coffee comes to us through one of our most celebrated producer relationships, a longstanding connection with the Mierisch family in Nicaragua. We visit the family each year to taste and select coffees as well as observe improvements and expansions on their farms. 
 Mama Mina—the nickname that Steve, Eleane, and Erwin Mierisch gave to their grandmother Giurmina—sits on land that has been in the family for more than 100 years. Erwin “Doc” Mierisch acquired the land in 1994 after the civil war, and began quickly working to improve the conditions by re-planting higher quality cultivars and implementing quality systems for pruning, harvesting, and processing. 
 These Caturra and Catuai cultivars are grown between 1,275 and 1,400 meters above sea level, and harvested between December and March each year. After the ripe cherries are harvested, they are processed at the Mama Mina wet mill, where they are depulped and fermented in concrete tanks overnight. The coffee is washed in channels before being transported to the patios and dry mill in at Beneficio Don Esteban outside of Matagalpa where it is dried, sorted, and milled for export. 
 This lot of coffee, which was constructed out of coffees from a few different harvest dates and a few different parts of the farm, struck us as being balanced and approachable while carrying a signature brightness and sweetness.
 All orders are roasted on Monday and Thursday and are shipped on the same day. Note that if you order Two-Day Shipping after 7am on any given day, your order will be processed *the following roast day*. We do this to ensure your coffee arrives to you as fresh as possible!

 This lot actually combines three farms, all owned by members of the Lovo family. Each farm’s lot was washed in a separate beneficio, then immediately delivered to the La Estrella mill for drying on African‐style raised and shaded beds.
 First, there’s dad: Don Joaquin Augusto Lovo Lopez. He’s sort of the neighborhood’s go‐to elder for specialty coffee. He made sure that his sons were educated, but kept them working on the family farm evenings and weekends.
 Among the sons: David Ariel Lovo Gutierrez. David Ariel bought Finca La Pradera back in 1969, and‐‐except for the conflicts of the 1980s‐‐hasn’t left it since.
 Finally, his brother: Don Luis Joaquin Lovo. He’s basically the spokesman for the family, or at least the guy who sells us the coffee. Don Luis is actually a pretty quiet guy for a spokesman, come to think of it. What he is, is driven. He’s the one who pesters the Estrella mill‐workers and his export partners, frequently checking in on the coffee’s quality, always seeking feedback.
 It was a desire for feedback as much as anything that motivated Don Luis to hold back a few bags of his Maragogype crop for the Nicaraguan Cup of Excellence. What he got was an award. We’ll have a little of that for you this summer. But for now, step into this Caturra lot from the whole Lovo family.
 Our café in Södermalm is where Drop Coffee was born. We started as a brick in the wall in 2009, roasting on a one kilo roaster for our visitors at the café. 
 The café is where we control and develop our standards as coffee roasters and baristas. All our focus is on serving a better cup of coffee and to give you a joyful moment.
 Beside our coffee you can get breakfast and lunch. Also, you can buy all the coffee straight from the roaster at our shelf in the café together with some home brew equipment.

 A balanced acidity reminiscent of passionfruit combines with a velvety mouthfeel to deliver this elegant and nuanced Nyeri county coffee. 
 Beginning in 1956 with just 250 member smallholder farmers, the Othaya Farmers Cooperative Society has grown to over 15,000 members who deliver their coffee cherries to one of their nineteen Nyeri county factories - among them, the Rukira factory. 
 Processing at the Othaya factories involves traditional pulping, double-fermentation, washing and sun-drying, but the Cooperative Society doesn’t stop there in supporting and empowering members to produce the highest quality possible; 
 From operating a nursery and farm store to provide inputs and seedlings to members; to integrating their own dry-milling operation allowing them to control quality through final hulling, sorting and grading phases; Othaya’s progressive approach to quality control inevitably leads us to some of our favorite Kenyan coffees, year after year. 
 This lot is a selection of the grade-AA beans from the members of the Rukira Factory. During the dry-milling process, coffee bean size is measured with an assortment of screens with holes of varying diameters. Grade-AA coffees are comprised of only the largest beans in the lot.

 Complex tropical overtones and flavors of pineapple and melon with fresh papaya acidity—pungent but smooth and balanced. .
 This is a particularly spectacular tiny lot from Nodier Andrade. We’ve been buying a variety of coffee from him throughout the season, pulling out these exceptional day lots to feature. His farm, El Mandarino, is high up in the mountains of Huila at 1900 meters. The combination of favorable climate, great varieties like Typica and Caturra and his approach to farm renovation and care of processing make this Colombian coffee like none we’ve ever offered. Wild brightness and sweet tomato notes can make this coffee mistakable for a Kenya on the cupping table.
 For more on Nodier Andrade, check out our blog post from a few years back.

REGION: SNNPR, Guji 
VARIETAL: Heirloom
FARM: Cheri Station
ALTITUDE: 1850-2000 M
FARMER: CPWE-Addis Ababa
ROAST: Medium
NOTES: Washed Process

 
    This bean offers a complex fusion of floral and dried fruit in aroma that transcends in the cup with sweet tones of berries, citrus-lime, and cocoa dusting along with a light and creamy finish.   
    
    This coffee is from the Guji Zone of the Cheri ward in the Hagermaryam district located within Sidamo. It lies within the greater Oromia region of Ethiopia and borders the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region (SNNPR). This is a privately owned organization that has roughly 700 contributing farmers using the mill at Cheri. 

 Avg Farm Size:Â 5 hectares to 50 hectares.
 Common Varieties:Â Caturra, Catuai, Villa Sarchi
 Whether washed, honey, or natural, Costa Rica leads the way with immaculate processing.Â Very clean, sweet, lemon, and toffee cups in the middle altitudes, and almost bottomless, sugary, raisin syrup cups at higher elevations.Â 
 Central Valley, WestÂ Valley, Guanacaste, Tres Rios, Turrialba, Orosi, Brunca, Tarrazu
 Tarrzu accounts for nearly 35% of the total coffee production in Costa Rica. The altitudes of 1000â1800m produce some of the most nuanced coffee profiles in Costa Rica. Tarrazu has been home to some of the most impressive advancements in coffee processing in the country, and the result is extremely clean coffees. Tarrazu is able to produce extremely high qualities of larger lots of coffee in addition to microlots.Â 
 The Central Valley comprises San Jose, Heredia and Alajuela provinces. The region is characterized by having a well-defined wet and dry season. The coffee plantations are at a range of 1000 to 14000 masl. The Central Valley yieldsÂ nearly 15% of the total production in the country.Â 
 The coffee plantations are located at an altitude range of 800 to 1400 masl. This region has produced an extremely high percentage of CeE winners, and produces nearly 25% of the total coffee production in the country. Primarily Villalobos and Villa Sarchi varieties are found here.
 The region is made up by the Alajuela, Guanacaste, and Puntarenas provinces. The coffee plantations are located in the mountain zones with cooler temperatures. The soil is volcanic, extremely fertile, and has excellent structure.
 The coffee plantations are located near the Irazu Volcano at an altitude range of 1200 to 1560 masl. The soil has a small tropical acidity caused by the volcano; it is rich with organic matter. The soil characteristic allows the good root development, holding moisture and facilitating the oxygen flow, supplying vitality to the tree.
 This region is characterized by having farms that are simultaneously cultivating coffee, cacao, and banana. The altitude range is between 600&ndash1300; masl. Caturra and Catuai varieties are cultivated in this region.
 Coffee has been grown for more than 100 years in Orosi. The fertile land and excellent climate conditions permits the coffee-growing activities. The farms are located at an altitude range of 1000â14000 masl. Volcanic soil and high fertility.
 Brunca consists ofÂ two cantons: Coto Brus and Perez Zeledon.
 Coto Brus: Located between the biological reserve and integrated by San Vito, Sabalito, Agua Buena, Limoncito, Pittier, and Coto Brus districts. The lands are very irregular, with abundant vegetation and good conditions for coffee growing.Â  The farms are located at an altitude range of 900â1400 masl with organic soils.
 Perez Zeledon: This area has an irregular topography because it is a valley surrounded by hills. The valley has abundant rivers with clean water. The valley creates the perfect conditions for microclimates and a diverse ecosystem. Caturra and Catuai varieties are cultivated in the region. The farms are located at an altitude of 1700 masl.
 Costa Rican coffees set the standard for washed (wet processed), bright Central American coffees in both the bean and at the mill. Costa Rican coffees are exceptionally high-grown in mostlyÂ volcanic soil. These two factors come together to produce a very bright and very clean cup. The best Costas develop an intense sugary sweetnessÂ to complement the straight-out brightness. Costa Rican coffees serve as an excellent bright single-origin coffee, and will definitely add life to various blends.
 Costa Rica has also coined the phrase âhoney processedâ for their version of pulped-natural coffees. Honey coffees are coffees dried with all or part of the sugary mucilage still left on the parchment. The result is an intensely sweet and slightly fruity cup. This cup profile is typically about halfway between a fully washed and natural coffee. Costa Rican producers have pushed the boundaries and truly refined in the process like no other country. Much of the rest of the coffee-producing world that is interested in processing experimentation looks to the pioneers in Costa Rica for direction.
 The many different regions of Costa Rica produce coffees with subtle, but distinct, differences in the cup.
 Tarrazu is the marquis region of Costa Rica noted for the best soils and highest altitudes. While no single country or region can guarantee an exact level of coffee year in and year out, as coffee is subject to wind, rain, sun, and other sometimes-less-than-cooperating forces of nature, coffees from Tarrazu do consistently stand out for their brightness and clean cups, with hints of light berry and apple cider.
 Volcan Poas, besides having one of the cooler-sounding coffee region names, it produces some very fine coffee with a bit more fruit than its southern neighbor of Tarrazu.
 Tres Rios in the cup is a bit softer and a bit more balanced than the straight-on, take-no-prisoners brightness of some of the other regions in Costa Rica. Coffees from this region are a great single-origin cup, or introduction to Costa Rican coffees.
 Another amazing feature of Costa Rican coffees is the human touch at the beneficios (mills) where the processing and milling of coffee approaches a level of artistry not easily surpassed. Besides immaculately clean mills, which are the standard, the efficiency and beauty of the inner workings of the mill amaze.
 For example, with strict Costa Rican environmental laws, wastewater from the fermentation tanks is treated with natural bacteria to break down the acidity reducing the pH back to levels that are tolerable for the streams and rivers of the country. By using the wood from pruned old coffee trees, along with the parchment from dry milling, many mills do not use a single stick of outside wood to fire the mechanical dryers. Some of the more inventive mills actually use the methane gasses produced when the bacteria breaks down the fermented pulp to fire the dryers. Finally, sun-dried coffees, of course, are just simplyÂ "solar" powered. All in all, the mills are an impressive sight, from the small single estate to the largest cooperatives.
 With such high standards in Costa Rican coffees to start with, intense cupping pays rewards as we seek out the subtle nuances that make certain cups outstanding among their peers.
 The first coffee seeds arrived to America in 1720, and at the end of 18th century the first Typica seeds were planted in Costa Rica.Â At this time, the agriculture in Costa Rica had a domestic focus. In the year 1808, the governor Tomas de Acosta began promoting the cultivation of coffee.
 Costa Rica was the first Central American country that established a true coffee industry. The priest Felix Velarde is considered to be the first coffee producer in Costa Rica.Â 
 In 1821, Costa Rican independence was achieved from Spain, and the municipal councils were the first to promote coffee cultivation with politics that included the delivery of small trees and land concession to whomever wanted to become a coffee producer. In the same year, Costa Rica had 17,000 coffee trees under production, and had already done the first export that consisted of 2 quintales shipped to Panama.
 In 1832 the first exportation to Europe was made. In the 1840s, the commerce with Europe as consolidated. In the following years, the production increased year by year.
 In 1830, the catalan Buenaventura Espinach Gaul, built the first paved patio and the first wet mill located to the south of Cartago. The micromill has become synonymous with Costa Rican coffee production today.Â 
 The first varieties planted were Typica or Creole, which was characterized by its high productivity and distinctive acidity.Â 
 Today Costa Rica accounts for 1% of the world's total coffee production.Â 
 Today we at CafÃ© Imports have successfullyÂ established our first office in a coffee-producing country. We have a state-of-the-artÂ lab and home base for our buying team in San Jose. Piero Cristiani is leading the charge at this office. Under Piero's direction, we have expanded our sourcing operation in Costa Rica to the point where we are acting as both exporter and importer. Piero and the green team have established many new exciting relationships in Costa Rica that have produced exquisite microlots and impressive full containers. Contact us to learn about partnering more closely with us and our office in Costa Rica.Â

    This bean brings out delightful and bright flavors of green apple, watermelon and raspberry along with sweet hints of brown sugar and milk chocolate in aroma and cup. 
    
    Best of Huila is a cupping competition created for roasters and green buyers to pick the very best coffees they can find. The top 12 coffees out of 750 submissions were cupped, ranked and auctioned where the roasters bid on their favorites. The Pink Bourbon is one of the rare and high ranking coffees featured at the auction lot competition. Of course, Mike Perry picked this unique and rare bean for all our Klatchaholics to enjoy! 
    
    The farmer/producer of the amazing coffee is Dieber Cifuentes. With the support of his wife, Adriana and daughter Sonia, Dieber became highly encouraged to pursue his passion for coffee by taking his process to the next level. 15 years later his coffee farm, Finca Pedregoza, provides a unique variety of high quality coffee, including the rare Pink Bourbon. Typically, a color description of a coffee cultivar or varietal describes the color of the coffee cherry, however, the Pink Bourbon refers to the color of the coffee shrub leaves as an effect caused by low-lying plants. Dieber was able to capitalize and refine this unique varietal, creating a distinct flavor profile.

 When Coava Coffee Roasters began packaging coffee by the kilogram in 2008 our intention was twofold: First: Our roaster has been designed to operate most efficiently by the kilogram. By sticking to the metric system and maintaining strict roast cycles, we’ve been able to reduce our waste to less than one pound of coffee per week. This careful planning is another way we show respect for the work of the coffee producers we represent. Second: Roasting by the kilogram allows us to package our coffees in 250 gram increments. Known as the Coava 250, our retail bags promote freshness, dissuade waste, and divide evenly with most brew methods. It is the perfect quantity for the average coffee drinker.
 To show respect for the full chain of quality coffee (sourcing, roasting, preparing) we do not offer any blends. Our coffees carry the names of the co-ops and individual farmers who harvest, process, and prepare them for us. We commit to show honor where honor is due.
 We only partner with producers who are mindful of their people, their environment, and their crop. The farms we work with take great care of their coffee from seedling to harvest, through processing and storing, and finally in packaging. It is through these sustainable partnerships that we ensure the longevity of the coffee beans and the final quality in the cup.
 We only work with the best importers and exporters. Their transparency, care for the farmers, and quality of transportation and storage of our coffees is absolutely essential. These partners are rarely heralded, but hold our industry together. Once the coffees arrive in Portland we move them directly into our green room. This temperature controlled room combines several proprietary practices and ensures that all of the work done before us is kept intact.

Brew Dog Daze in the morning to get going for a day of canoeing, swimming and laying on the beach day drinking. Make a little more in the afternoon to keep you going through all the hot summer night partying. Also, relieves itchy mosquito bites.*

 A blend of chocolate tones and sweet fruits
 Orion was designed to produce a unique espresso blend accentuating the elegance of chocolate and the complex nature of sweet fruit. 
 When we started planning our coffee program, we knew we wanted a strong, foundational house espresso; something complex enough to be enjoyed alone, and additionally have enough depth to hold up in milk. The combination of elements had to reflect something greater than their parts. Each character had to play its role to balance and accentuate the others. In unison, they create Orion: rich and silky in body, covering a range of chocolate tones with balancing notes of dark berries and citrus highlights. Although the elements occasionally change to reflect the seasonality of coffee harvests, these are the driving principles behind how we shape Orion.
 Orion, our flagship espresso, bears a name loaded in history. Orion is a constellation on the celestial equator. It is so bright and recognizable in the sky that humans have been marveling at it since the beginning of time. The belt of Orion is aligned with major, unexplained monoliths, such as the Great Pyramids and Teotihuacan. In Mayan culture, Orion was believed to be the beginning point of all creation, and they built their metropolis in response to it. In Greek myths, Orion is a superhuman giant often represented with a bronze club and shield. Even some US history has references to Orion: The Hopi villages (in what is now Arizona) from 1120AD mimic major stars of Orion like a map. Hopi beloved Orion was origin of their creator, Massaw. Ubiquitous in myth, Orion is the foundation for cities and culture.

 The Kiruga mill is a great u-turn success story. What we mean by this is that many considered it the lowest performing factory in the Othaya co-op just last year! However, this season, with the diligent work of factory manager Anthony Gatheru Gachuka and some highly beneficial input from agronomists with Kenya Coffee Cooperative Exporters, their quality might just be the best of any factory in Othaya now.
 Phil visited the Othaya mill for the first time this season, and left very impressed. It’s an atypically sophisticated operation, complete with a cupping lab and a dry mill. The members of the board of directors were warm and welcoming and invited Phil to cup for many hours at their lab. It was there that he found this extraordinary lot. Phil was on the lookout for great coffees from Kiruga, but this coffee really exceeded all expectations. Exotic, clean and transparent it was one of his highest scoring coffees of the trip! 
 The most fantastic element of the cupping experience at Othaya was that the grinder was malfunctioning, and the coffee for the cuppings was incredibly coarsely ground. All the coffees tasted were most certainly under-extracted, but nevertheless utterly delicious. During his visit Phil found about 10 lots that were truly stellar, then pared them down based on moisture content, water activity and a thorough visual inspection of the green. In the end, we bought all of these coffees and this season all of our Kenyans are from Othaya! 
 Their cupping lab is under the direction of David Wairagu, who also runs the dry milling operation. It’s clear that David cares deeply about the quality of the coffee and it shows in the cup. Unfortunately, the power was out all afternoon during his visit, so Phil couldn’t see their new dry mill in operation, but their newly installed Cimbria huller was surely an improvement from the old style impact huller, which would have overheated the coffee. 
 Every processing step must be carefully and meticulously managed; however, the key improvement at Kiruga (over last year) was the sorting of their wet parchment. For those that haven’t seen it before, the wet, clean parchment (after fermentation and soaking) is quite translucent. What this means is that one can see directly though it to determine the color of the interior seed. The shade of the seed color can then be used to determine its level of ripeness. If the strongly green-hued seeds are then sorted out, the cup quality is vastly improved, as these are under-ripes. Under-ripes will introduce less sweetness, green flavors as well as an astringent mouthfeel. This was the single most important change made at Kirgua, and it underscores the usefulness of this sorting! We look forward to continuing our relationship with Kirgua and Othaya for many years to come!

 Why you’ll love it: Sweet and refined, this bright Ethiopian coffee will please the perfectionist in all of us.
 Story of the bean: Yirg for Yirgacheffe, Z for zero defect. Ethiopian coffees from the Yirgacheffe region are world-renowned for producing distinctively floral and aromatic coffee. "Zero defect" means this coffee is triple sorted by size, color, and density until it reaches a point of near perfection. This new harvest is on a new level of coffee obsession. The mountains and soil of the Yirgacheffe region are known for producing coffees with floral and citrus aromas. Our importing partner, Samuel Demisse, has amplified this reputation by employing a rigorous sorting process in Ethiopia.
 Workers at the mill are paid well to sort the coffee seeds by hand, meaning only the very best beans make it to La Colombe. This pure expression of these Heirloom varietal results in a coffee with the clean, pronounced taste of traditional Yirgacheffe coffees.

 Robinson Figueroa is a stand out among his coffee producing peers.  As a 3rd generation producer, he focuses on quality production over quantity.  When visiting last, we were excited to see Robinson planting a part of his farm with geisha & bourbon varieties.  With plans in place to build his own wet mill, we expect great things from Robinson in future years.
 This offering is a delicious anchor on our offerings menu with flavors of white wine, vanilla, & baker’s chocolate.

 This weekend, we debuted two new seasonal drinks, and brought back one old favorite. Kirkwood Barista Kim Morice has the details:
 The Shaken Lavender Rose iced latte combines our Espresso 700 with whole milk and a house-made syrup using our Indian Rose Garden tea. This drink is refreshing with subtle notes of lavender and rose, which mixes well with our espresso. 
 Another refreshing addition to our summer menu is our Shaken Rose Garden iced tea. Also using our Indian Rose Garden iced tea, this drink is prepared over ice with an ounce of a honey and lemon simple syrup and shaken to perfection. 
 For the fourth year in a row, we are bringing back our Shaken Honey Almond Cold Brew. Our cold brewed Espresso 700 is combined with honey and a splash of almond milk, and shaken until mixed. This is a guest favorite, a smooth and subtly sweet iced drink is perfect for summer months.

 St. Louis based Kaldi’s Coffee Roasting Co. is excited to announce the opening of four new stores in 2016. These will be the seventh and eighth stores in the St. Louis area and the second and third stores in Atlanta, Georgia for the company. 
 The first St. Louis location to open will be at the Gerhart building, located in the Gerhart Lofts at the corner of Laclede and Vandeventer, next to St. Louis University and the Cortex district. The second will be at the Mid Campus Center (MCC) building, located at 4590 Children’s Place, which is currently under construction on Washington University’s Medical School campus.
 The Gerhart building is located blocks from Kaldi’s Coffee’s Roastery, and will join the burgeoning neighborhood in St. Louis. “With IKEA going in, and SLU right across the street, we saw the potential for this location. When Capstone Development approached us about opening a cafe, we couldn’t have been more pleased,” says Kaldi’s owner Tricia Zimmer-Ferguson. The cafe is part of a larger rehabilitation of the building, with other retail on the first floor and lofts on the second. The building itself dates to 1897 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. “Expect to see some classic architecture and details mixed in with some new modern touches” adds Zimmer-Ferguson.
 “We’ve been looking to add a new location in St. Louis for the past couple years and these two are perfect fits” continues Zimmer-Ferguson. “Our relationship with Washington University just keeps getting stronger, and the new MCC building is going to be a beautiful addition to their campus. We’re excited to build out our location within the larger construction of the building, so we can form our ideal cafe from the ground up.” The Kaldi's Coffee at the MCC is in partnership with Bon Appetit Management Company.
 Kaldi’s Coffee is working with Space Architects on the Gerhart cafe and Christner on the MCC cafe.
 The two new locations in Atlanta, Ga., will join Kaldi’s first Atlanta store at Emory University’s Dobbs University Center. Bon Appetit Management Company and Emory University invited Kaldi’s to open a store there last summer. Building on that success, Kaldi’s will open a full-service cafe at the Depot, a historic train station located at One Eagle Row, in the heart of Emory’s campus, and a coffee bar at the Emory University School of Medicine.
 The Depot was built as the train station for Emory University in 1916, but service there stopped in 1970. Subsequent iterations of the building were an art gallery, a credit union, and a restaurant. “We’re excited to expand our presence at Emory University,” says Kaldi’s owner Tyler Zimmer. “We’ve been developing a different menu for this location too, since we have a full kitchen to work in.”  Kaldi’s is working with Square Feet Studio on the Depot cafe. The Emory University School of Medicine location will consist of coffee service, house-made bakery, and some grab & go items.

 Caitlin, one of our customer service reps, Brandon, from our Kirkwood cafe, and Bud, one of our roasters, were in Las Capucas, Honduras last week. Here are some stories and pictures from their trip.
 We visited Beneficio Santa Rosa de Copan on our way to Las Capucas. Their facility was beautiful and they had a great cupping lab. We took a tour of the dry mill - they poke every bag for QC as they stack them in amazing pyramids in the warehouse. The really large white bags are micro lots that are separated. They are sorting by density and again by color - using electronic sorting (infared camera picks out the ones that aren't the right color). 
 We cupped the top 10 finalists for the cupping competition. There were lots of great coffees throughout the trip so it's no surprise that the top ten scored well (85+). We then went to the zipline! This course consisted of 5 ziplines that took us from a farm to the Las Capucas wet mill - what a great view from above! Brandon was the most courageous - great aerial videos and photos are thanks to him Bud and I were holding on too tight - no free hands for photography! 
 Brandon and I started the morning at the farm of Bernard Ornilla. His entrepreneurial spirit has resulted in many projects to better the community and continually improve quality. Bernard is always moving forward and his farm, Finca de Origenes Planon, is no exception. Located at almost 1700 meters in the Celaque mountains, this farm spreads down the mountainside and makes for a beautiful landscape. Finca de Origenes Planon, meaning "origins", the farm is compiled of many different varietals from many different origins across the globe. We saw red catuai, yellow catuai, and red bourbon among other varieties. Because the farm is organic, many other plants grow among the coffee trees including lemons, limes, avocados, bananas, and plantains. 
 The festivities began later that day with Te Van a Conocer Compa. There was great music, local vendors, wonderful dances and delicious street food. They announced the winners of the competition and we got to meet the farmers who's coffee we will be featuring at Kaldi's. The winner of the competition had visited Atlanta a few years ago. He was beside himself when we shared with him that we were going to feature his coffee in our cafe in Atlanta. What a great connection! We hope to continue to grow our relationship with the producers of Las Capucas in the future.

 A lot of us at Kaldi’s are big big soccer fans. We’ve played growing up, we’ve played in college, our kids play, and we even had a go at an indoor league (check out that picture!). But this may be our proudest soccer moment yet. Starting this year, Kaldi’s is a proud sponsor of the Saint Louis Football Club and St. Louis Scott Gallagher.
 “We followed the club pretty close last year, so when the opportunity arose to be a part of this team, we jumped at the opportunity.” says Kaldi’s co-owner Tyler Zimmer. “Their proud connection to St. Louis and all the work they do with the city and with their youth programs only made us more excited to lend our support.”
 We can’t wait to follow the team in the USL this year, and look forward to the years to come.

 Wednesday was a travel day for our group. After spending the first 2 days in Pyin Oo Lwin, it was time to head to the highlands of Shan state. Myanmar has many different microclimates and the weather changed quite a bit on our drive. It is still 2 months until raining season begins and much of the drive was very brown. It will look very differently in May. It took us 7 hours to make the trip including a few stops to see some amazing heritage sites and pagodas.
 Ywangan is home to many smallholders in the area. In 2013, there was a new emphasis brought to the area to try to increase quality and in return, a better price for their coffee. Traditionally, much of the coffee in the area was either consumed domestically or in China, neither bringing very high prices. Coffee has been grown in this area since 1890, after it was introduced by English Missionaries. There are dozens of small villages in the area and the Myanmar Coffee Association has begun to work with about 30 of them, representing over 400 smallholder farmers. Traditionally, the coffee is washed as each village has their own pulper. Winrock and USAID have helped set up a small cupping lab in Ywangan complete with a sample roaster and dehuller, where we will cup 14 different lots from different villages. Winrock also has a full time Q grader here training locals on technical and cupping skills. The goal is build a sustainable model locally.
 We visited with Myanmar Coffee Association Vice Chairman, U Win Aung Kyaw at a local storage building where coffee is often stored before heading to the Mandalay Coffee Group to be dry hulled. The vice chairman was very grateful for the visit and is very encouraged by the improved quality they are seeing. They have doubled the prices that the local farmers are be paid to incentivize quality. He said they need to continue education and training but they are seeing an impact. Other small growers in the area are noticing the difference and want to be more involved with the association and Winrock. One of the bigger changes has been implementing some new ideas on the processing side. They have been doing some natural process coffees and the results seem encouraging.
 After meeting with U Win Aung Kyaw, we met with Su Su Aung and many other smallholders, all women. She has been very active as a leader in the area since 2004-2005 when she began acting as a broker for the region and encouraging trade between the producers and China. Su Su Aung had a very impressive milling operation and some of the cleanest looking natural coffees you will see in any coffee producing countries. She has had training from Mario Fernadez and Marcelo Pereira, who is a Winrock employee and coffee veteran after stints in Costa Rica, Brazil, and Ethiopia. She is a role model for all the women producers in the region. Her production of naturals is small this year, 2,000 pounds, but she hopes for more next year.
 Thursday we will begin to cup many coffees from the area and visit many local villages to see some production. More to come…  #followthegoat

 It is our second day here in Pyin Oo Lin and we start out the day by heading to the Mandalay Coffee Group’s office and cupping lab. We checked out their mill and the systems they have in place. This is the 2nd year that the mill is in operation and it is as nice as any in the world. All the coffee here is wet processed and fermented 24 hours in concrete tanks. The coffee is then moved to the concrete patios where the coffee is turned and raked until it is dry. It is then moved to their storage facility where the coffee rests until the parchment is ready to be removed at the dry mill. They are still finishing their dry mill on property so their coffee is milled at a nearby facility.
 After the more in-depth tour of the mill we have 2 rounds of tables to cup. There are 17 coffees from the Pyin Oo Lwin region that we are evaluating. For perspective, last there were very few coffees scored over 82 points in the entire country. In this morning’s cupping I scored 11 of the 17 over 82 points with the lowest score being 80 and the highest score 85. This is a dramatic improvement in quality from last year and this is still a very small sample size. Most of the top coffees last year came from the Ywangan area in Southern Shan state which we will see tomorrow and Thursday.
 After cupping we visited two more estates beginning with the Lone Star Estate. The ways that some of the farms get their names is quite funny. In this instance the owner had a friend from Texas and next thing you know you get Lone Star Estate! This was another relatively large farm of about 100 acres, 85 of which is planted with coffee, one of the other crops is dragon fruit. Lone Star grows only the S795 variety which is a hybrid of Liberica and Kent (typica) at 1150 meters above sea level. This is one of the more popularly planted varieties planted in Myanmar. We did come across just a few yellow fruited plants, probably yellow catuai. We had tasted this coffee as a pourover on Monday at the MCG offices but it did not show quite as well on the cupping table, scoring 81.5 for me.
 After Lone Star we headed to other side of Pyin Oo Lwin to Mr. Sai Wan’s farm, Green Land. One of the first things we see is Sai Wan’s nursery filled with SL 34, Sarchimor (a Costa Rica hybrid) and Panama Geisha! He also had macadamia and a type of shade tree called silver oak that was actually an evergreen. Most of the farm is planted with Sarchimor with a small amount dedicated to SL 34. He is planning on planting more SL 34 this year. A large portion of the coffee is washed and fermented 24 hours, though he has begun to do some small experimenting of naturals. Sai Wan had 3 coffees on this morning’s table and all 3 scored 83 points or higher. I scored his lots, 83, 84, and 85 respectively, the 85 lot being a naturally processed lot of sarchimor, great results for his first year of processing naturals!
 Pyin Oo Lwin has been a great experience so far. Such big improvements are being made in a short period of time, though they still have a ways to go in overall quality. Tomorrow we head off to southern Shan, near Ywangan to visit the many small holders in the area.

 We got off to an early start, as we had to leave for the airport in Yangon to fly to Mandalay, the old capitol of Mynmar. It was about a 2 hour flight to Mandalay, in the center of the country. It is hot and dry this time of year, like Yangon, with raining season beginning in April and May. We had a 2 hour drive up some very windy roads to the Pyin Oo Lwin area. 
 As we made our way up the mountains, the temperatures cooled down but the landscape is still very dry this time of year. Our first stop was to the Mandalay Coffee Group and the Myanmar Coffee Association. The Mandalay Coffee Group is a group of local producers that received a grant from Winrock International to build a new wet mill and dry mill. It is state of the art and is among the nicest mills you will see in any coffee producing country. The wet mill has new fermentation tanks and most of the coffee is dried on concrete patios or raised beds. We had brief discussion there with many from the group. They were very enthusiastic about our visit.
 From there we drive about 5 miles to visit our first farm of the trip, Shwe Pu Zun. As we drive up, we see very tall, skinny, evergreen like trees planted in between the rows of coffee. The trees are extremely shaded. We found out later that one reason the trees are so heavy is to keep the temperature of the farm more even since they have threat of frost in this area. They had a small wet mill where all the coffee is washed, some of demucilaged and some is pulped and goes through a 24 hour dry ferment before finishing the washing process. Shwe Pu Zun is about 100 acres planted in 2000-2002. It is mostly planted with Catimor, S795, and SL34. There are probably a few other varieties mixed in, but they are for the most part sorted when picked and processed. Their annual production was about 100,000 pounds grown at about 1050 meters above sea level.
 The next farm we visited was about 40 acres and home to the 2nd place winner in the cupping competition last year, Sithar Farm. This farm is owned by Thu Zaw and his father in the law. The coffee is grown at about 1100 meters and is a mixture of SL34, Catimor, and S795. This year, they are expected to produce about 18,000 pounds of green coffee. They also have future plans to expand the farm.
 Overall it was a great first day getting introduced to Pyin Oo Lwin. There is much excitement about the possibility for specialty coffee here, and they have taken many steps to begin improving the process. We will learn more today as we move through the first round of cuppings.

 Producer: Lori Obra  Farm: Rusty’s Hawaiian  Altitude: 2000 feet  Region: Ka’u  Varietal: Yellow Caturra  Process: Natural  Roast: Light  Notes: Black Cherry, Passion Fruit, White Wine
 This highly awarded nano-lot of Rusty’s Hawaiian Yellow Caturra Natural has become one of the most sought after coffees we offer. Our 2015 roast garnered a 97.5 point score and Five Star Rating from Roast Ratings!
 In 2010, farm owner Lorie Obra was recognized as Outstanding Producer by the Specialty Coffee Association of Europe while Rusty’s Hawaiian Yellow Caturra Natural garnered a 95-point score from Coffee Review and was awarded Grand Champion of the Hawaii Coffee Association’s cupping competition. In 2011, Rusty's Hawaiian repeated and won the competition again. That same year champion barista Pete Licata, formerly of PT’s Coffee Roasting Co., worked with Rusty's Hawaiian to develop his competition espresso blend using the Yellow Caturra Natural. The coffee helped Pete to win 1st place in the United States Barista Competition and 2nd place in the World Championship in Bogota, Colombia.
 With only a few hundred Yellow Caturra trees on the farm, this coffee harvest is an exceptional nano-lot. It started out as a difficult coffee, frustrating Lorie with its results after the standard Washed Method. Thanks to her curious mind and scientific background, Lorie discovered that the Natural Process, rarely used in Hawaii, produces the intense flavor profile her Yellow Caturra has become famous for.
 Rusty and Lorie Obra started their famous coffee farm on the Big Island of Hawaii in the Ka'u region in 1999 on a small parcel of land near the Mauna Loa volcano. Rusty, a retired chemist, and Lorie, a former medical technologist, both had backgrounds in science, which contributed to the overall quality produced on the farm. They started testing different processing methods to get the best flavors out of each variety grown on the farm. Hawaii has long been famous for coffee grown in the Kona region. Rusty had always dreamed of making coffee from the Ka'u region some of the best in the world.
 In 2006, Lorie was left at a crossroads; Rusty had been diagnosed with lung cancer and passed away shortly thereafter. Lorie was left with the difficult decision to either sell the farm or try to run it herself. Faced with the daunting decision, she could not let go of Rusty's dream: to make Ka'u coffee some of the best in the world. Lorie's determination and hard work allowed Rusty's dream, and hers, to be realized in 2007. Rusty's Hawaiian placed in the top 10 of the Specialty Coffee Association of America's top 10 coffees for Hawaii / Asia / Indonesia regional competition. Miguel Meza noticed the success in the region, and could see the potential in Ka'u coffee. He moved to Hawaii and became a coffee consultant for the Ka'u Coffee Growers Cooperative. His guidance and encouragement helped Lorie refine her processing and experimentation.
 Lorie is now recognized as one of the leading innovators and producers in the coffee world, making Rusty's Hawaiian one of the most decorated award winners over the last few years.
 This is a rare and lively cup of coffee with a citrusy aroma of tropical fruit and brown sugar, syrupy body, and vibrant acidity. It has a sophisticated sweet flavor of black cherry and lemonade with an orange marmalade sweetness. The finish is crisp and sweet with notes of passion fruit and white wine.
 When you visit the Four Barrel Homeroom for our bi-weekly public cuppings, you’ll usually taste about a dozen different coffees that we offer at that moment. If, on the other hand, you sneak into that room on a random rainy afternoon, you might see a cupping that’s a lot more intense.
 You’ll see forty or more different bowls circling the circumference of our cupping table. Each sample will be labeled with the same name: Andino.
 As we taste through those samples in a silence broken only by inelegant slurping sounds, we make notes on clipboards and spreadsheets. Once we’ve come to our personal conclusions, we get together to assign scores and choose favorites. That’s where the fine print comes in.
 Besides “Andino,” each sample includes some fine print scribbled in pencil: the farm name, the harvest date, and any other distinguishing notes for that particular micro-lot. For instance, one of the names that made this lot of Andino is David Burbano–the very first Andino farmer we worked with there, six years ago. So the fine print might say, “Burbano lot #7.”
 That’s how we build our Andino out of the many separate lots from the hundred-some members of the Andino co-op and their neighbors… slurping and scribbling.
 Okay, there’s a little more to it than that: there’s days of sample roasting, weeks of personal visits to Huila, and hours of dishwashing. But mostly it’s about the slurping. Drop by sometime.

 This coffee was a magic carpet ride for us. Starting with the depth of Figs, zigging to the sweetness of a Mango, and zagging to the end with a splash of White Grape Juice. It's a whole new world. 
 Region: Rio NegroFarm: 5 VariousMunicipality: IquiraVarietal: Yellow BourbonAltitude: 1600-1750 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed 
 Yellow Bourbon is a natural cross between Red Bourbon and Amarelo de Botacuto, which is labelled as a Typica variant with yellow fruit. Bourbon resulted from selections made by French botanists in wild Yemeni coffee groves. Moved to controlled fields for propagation, the relatively humble stock produced a remarkable variety and was given the namesake of its nursery - Bourbon Island - upon its introduction to South American. Under expanded cultivation in Brazil, a yellow mutant with a unique flavor profile expressed itself and was isolated, expanded, and named for its color.
 This Variety Select lot comes to us courtesy of five small farmers from the villages surrounding the municipality of Iquira. With volcanic soil, anaverage temperature of 20-25° C, and 160 CM of annual rainfall, this area is extremely conducive to the cultivation of coffee. Generally, these farmers are processing only ripe cherries the same day of harvest using a dry fermentation of 18-24 hours. The coffees are then washed, and dried in parabolicos for an average duration of 12-18 days.

 Today, SFMOMA is hosting a Topping Out event in Jesse Square park, where everyone can witness the highest beam lifted into place on their expanded building.  It’s hard to believe that over a year has passed since the SFMOMA ground breaking ceremony, where we marked the occasion with a site-specific cookie wall.   While we won’t be participating in today’s events, we wanted to share these photos taken on a shoot in July, commemorating a building that today reaches new heights, always deserving of a celebration, and happens to look great as a dessert.
 Originally, we created this layered dessert, inspired by Mario Botta’s iconic striated turret, for a press event introducing Snohetta’s plans for  SFMOMA’s expansion.  Alternating layers of black cocoa cake and whipped cream topped with a chocolate sable were diligently stacked in these perfect glass votives that Caitlin found on a whim.
 We were adamant about getting the dessert turret documented with the architectural turret it was inspired by.  So we packed up the camera, a pint of whipping cream, and a whisk and headed downtown where we whipped the cream and assembled the dessert on site.  Which happened to be outside at the fountain area just across the street from the museum we remember and love.  And now whenever I pass it, I think of all the amazing art-inspired desserts we got to make within the building, and how much fun is yet to be had outside of it.  Like whipping cream in situ.
 Two of our favorite and most frequent visitors to the rooftop coffee bar were curators of Architecture and Design, Jennifer Dunlop Fletcher and Joseph Becker.  They would come up for their morning espresso drinks, sometimes again for a meeting in the afternoon and if the timing was right, I would poke my head out from the kitchen to say a quick hello and inquire about any creative endeavors.  In their open and generous manner, they would update us on what they were working on next or who they were meeting while they waited (never too long) for their drinks. In exchange, I would usually give them a taste of what we were working on.  These brief exchanges would often turn into collaborations on a special event or a dessert.   On a tour with Jennifer through the Buckminster Fuller exhibition, as it was being installed, the creation of the Buckminster Fuller Hot Chocolate was finalized when we saw the magazine cover of the proposed floating village in a vitrine.  
 It was always a treat to correspond with people who reply to emails with enthusiasm and in some case with thoughts they might have on art that would make a good dessert.  Like these from Joseph:
 Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, ‘Dropped Cone’ (2001)
 and Le Corbusier…too architectural? But what about a chocolate meringue Ronchamp? Yum!
 This time two years ago,  Field Conditions opened.  This exhibition of “spatial experiments”, included nearly 30 works by artists and architects, and entirely in black, white and shades of grey.   For the opening event, the A+D department partnered with SFMOMA’s education team who had scheduled a program in conjunction with the San Francisco Electronic Music Festival to celebrate John Cage.

 We were already fans of Tauba Auerbach’s work, from the 2009 SECA exhibition which was up when we first opened the rooftop coffee bar, so it was no surprise that her “50/50 Floor” appealed to us.   The giant floor-tile installation, (coupled with a kinetic light installation by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer) is made of 50% black tiles and 50% white tiles, which are randomly distributed over the floor in a QR code–like pattern.  Could we do a Mondrian-style cake that when cut into could be photographed with a QR code reader and take you to a website? We dreamed in black and white.

 As the installation of the 50/50 floor neared completion, we got word at the side kitchen door that there were a few square feet of the black and white tile left.  I asked Joseph if we could use it for the event to serve the series of black and white crackers we were working.  In minutes we had them in the kitchen and started working on some spreads for the crackers.  I acquired some squid ink from our friend Stuart at State Bird Provisions and waited for Tess, (a vegan whom I care for dearly and who, I was afraid would never come back to work if she had to witness squid ink in our sweet little production kitchen), to leave for the day before I attempted to color match our house-made ricotta to the black tile.
 photo courtesy of Lanlian Szeto of SFMOMA, thankfully she took this, because it’s the only documentation we have of the whole process/event!
 Here, Tess Wilson and I are setting up what we like to affectionately call Tauba’s “Auer-crack-ers”.  We set up black and white tiles that functioned as serving plates for the crackers buttermilk (white) and black charcoal (black).  Guests were invited to choose their own spread (which we couldn’t help ourselves refer to as grout) from a selection of housemade squid ink ricotta, white bean hummus, black sesame spread and whipped ricotta.  Everyone was entertained at the thought that they were essentially “eating off the floor” and delighted to get to take their tile home as a memento.
 I just learned that today, August 26th 2014, is National Dog Day! In lieu of bombarding you with videos of cute dogs eating cake, I thought this would be a perfect occasion to share some photos of the time we made dog biscuits for humans.   Last January, the Roxie Theater screened Mike Mills’ 2011 film Beginners as part of an event for SFMOMA’s Live Projects series.As frequent SFMOMA collaborators, we set up a table at the front of the theatre to serve ticket holders New Orlean’s Iced Coffee and bags of dog treats to eat at specific points throughout the film. 
 The audience, fully caffeinated and captivated as they listen to director Mike Mills in conversation with SFMOMA’s Gina Basso about the film and his recent commission for Project Los Altos.
 In Beginners, Oliver (played by Ewan McGregor) inherits a Jack Russell, Arthur (played by Cosmo), from his father after he dies. For those who haven’t seen the film, Arthur has subtitles. This could be taken for him “talking,” but Mills suggests that the dog’s subtitles throughout the movie are “a way to externalize a character who was sometimes non-verbal.”  
 While we are huge Mike Mills fans, nothing gets our attention like a cute dog and the delight at what ensues when that cute dog “talks”:  the sound of 150 bags of cookies rustling at various points throughout a film.  
 When Design*Sponge approached me about building a photo backdrop for their book release party, I instantly arranged a meeting (drinks at Locanda) with Leah Rosenberg, my dear friend, boss, and partner-in-cake-crime. Though Leah’s an incredible painter, and I like to dabble in embroidery and flower-arranging, when we work together there’s generally baking involved. Leah’s the head pastry chef for Blue Bottle Coffee in SFMOMA’s Rooftop Sculpture Garden, and I’m her assistant, and we’re happiest when we’re working up there in our little 6'x6’ kitchen. Our brainstorming session yielded quite a few excellent, edible ideas that we would need serious grant money to pull off, but our favorite reasonable one was the notion of a wall of cookies. The Glamorous Wall Of Cookies… Guests could have their picture taken, eat a cookie, and feel at peace with the world.
 We went to work. I made a test batch of cookies just to play with sprinkles and such. I had the invaluable help of an enthusiastic 11-year-old, obviously a sprinkle & lustre-dust prodigy (she also took the photo).
 Using the random marker colors we had on hand, Leah & I did a (very, very rough) sketch of the cookie wall, to entice the Design*Sponge team. They liked it! The Glamorous Wall of Cookies was a go.
 I created a game plan in an Excel document to keep us on track. I don’t know if you can read my writing, but the only thing checked off is “Make a pointless Excel document”. 
 Next, I grabbed a piece of wood and a few nails from home and brought them to the tiny kitchen. We experimented with making holes in the cookies and hanging them from the wood, creating what I like to call The Hobo Wall Of Terror.  Don’t be scared, it’s all part of the process.
 Now that we felt confident that it was possible to hang cookies on a wall, we crunched the numbers and got started making 500 cookies. Remember: 6'x6’ kitchen. Our mixer can handle enough dough to make about 60 cookies, so we would be making 9 or 10 batches. As you can tell from her paintings and art cakes, Leah is incredibly skilled at creating and combining colors so she tinted her cookies confidently, but I still have so much to learn.
 I tinted small amounts of dough at a time, scared I would ruin an entire batch.  This actually ended up working fine, as we were so inspired by Julia Rothman’s book tour illustrations. We wanted to capture all the subtle colors she used, as well as the d*s ribbons and the gorgeous book cover.
 We rolled and cut the dough.
 We punched holes in each one (we discovered that old-fashioned paper straws worked best).
 And once all the cookies were baked, carefully layered them in Cambros, labeled with their quantity & (occasionally questionable) colors.
 All the while, the task of building an actual wall (that could hold 500 cookies and wouldn’t fall on people) loomed. We admitted we’re really more cake-bakers than wall-builders, so we outsourced to our immensely talented friend Sam of Synth Island, who whipped up an elegant, sturdy design.  The three of us took a fieldtrip to Discount Builders, where every single person working helped us. They were all patient, efficient, friendly, and truly helpful.
 We’d brought cookie “swatches” which we intended to share with all the employees….until I set them down in the wet color sample the nice paint boys whipped up for us. You see, it’s not enough to see what the cookies look like nearby the paint color- they really need to be all up in it. From the beginning, I’d been envisioning colorful cookies on a gold background- gold to reference the book cover and to add plenty of glamour. Leah gently reminded me that no paint would create the true-gold background I dreamed of- for that, we would need to gold-leaf the wall (we would still love to do this, so please contact us if you need a gold-leafed wall full of possibly edible-gold-leafed cookies. It would be gorgeous..). Instead of settling for a trying-to-be-gold-but-really-yellow effect, Leah had the great idea of using the pretty grey of the Design*Sponge website. When I put the cookies in the paint, the colors really popped, so we were satisfied.
 We found everything we needed, and loaded it up in a Zipcar (one of 4 vehicle rentals involved in this project- none of us have a car, and I don’t even have a license).
 The actual wall had to be built on the sidewalk in front of Sam’s apartment, as San Francisco apartments cannot accommodate very much lumber. Leah & I gridded out the holes for all of the nails (that took a few attempts), deciding to hang 2 cookies on each nail so the colors would change throughout the night of the party. I drilled, I broke the drillbit, she drilled, nailed, and painted, and I tried not to break anything else.  The day of the party arrived and Leah baked the hundreds of cookies in our little oven (referred to affectionately by guests as our Easy-Bake Oven). Our friend Kelly volunteered to be Leah’s lovely cookie wall assistant at the party, since I would be out of town. Excitement was running high! We love Design*Sponge, we love baking, and we love outlandish projects- I hope everyone at the event had as much fun as we did making the cookie wall!
 Here are some photos taken at the event at Anthropologie.  You can see  Blair Sneddon’s photos of guests posing in front of the wall eating their cookies here!

 We featured our Cartagena Ice Cream and Sorbet Trio in Modern Art Desserts, but didn’t get to include the story (or picture) of when we fed Alejandro Cartagena (the artist, himself!) the trio of ice creams and sorbets. He and Pablo Lopez Luz, another artist featured in the Photography in Mexico exhibition, were in town for the opening celebration, and we were delighted to invite him up to try our finalized (just in time for the opening!) dessert.
  Alejandro Cartagena and Pablo Lopez Luz eat some ice cream!
 We learned earlier on that it is best to get a sense of an upcoming show ahead of time, to talk to curators as they are planning the exhibition, to get inside scoops from the museum install crew, to make the most successful rendition of a dessert based on an artwork.  Often, extra time was needed to get the approval of the artist, or to work out serving details, or to order ribbon…from Canada. 
 But none of this mattered when I discovered one Wednesday night in April that Mary Heilmann was giving a lecture downstairs at the Wattis Theatre the following night.  Mary Heilmann  is my favorite artist. I could go on about how her work got me through grad school, but best to cut to the part about cake.
 I didn’t sleep that night – Mary Heilmann’s paintings playing like a slide show through my head – each one a possible dessert.  I thought about just going to the lecture, sitting on the edge of my seat and on her every word, but it would be a dream come true to meet her in person.  And if I met her in person, I would have to make her a dessert.  This is, afterall, why we were there doing what we did in the tiny kitchen at SFMOMA.  For moments like this. And this, and this, and even this.  
 Mary Heilmann, Fire and Ice Remix/ sketch by Leah for Fire and Ice dessert
 I had to carefully plan the following day, already packed with regular production, meetings and whatever else comes up in a day, in order to make something for Mary with the time and resources available.   Maybe all this sounds a bit crazy-making.  Or maybe, it sounds a bit like art-making.  Whatever it was, on April 11, 2013, thanks to some fancy facilitating by SFMOMA Public Programs Associate, Gina Basso, I got to meet Mary and Mary got an impromptu dessert based on her painting Fire and Ice Remix.   This Red Hot Red Velvet Cake with crème fraiche-spiked cream cheese frosting and buttermilk ice milk was made once and never again, what one might call an Artist Proof in the printmaking world,  I suppose. 
 In the time between a tech run-through and her lecture, Gina brought Mary Heilmann up to the rooftop for a cake and ice cream remix of her Fire and Ice Remix.  
 While the dessert might not have been perfect, it was eaten and now is gone.  Which thankfully, is not the case with the painting that inspired it. One week after her lecture, I received this sweet note in my inbox from Mary (herself!).  Even her emails turned to art. 
 “Leah   Thank you  again  for the beautiful  Fire and Ice Dessert…..  
 I even saved some and brought it                                                                                                               home to new york and ate it when I got home.Hey here it is I ’ll never forget   Love Mary H”
 For years, Tony Cragg's Guglie was the first artwork we would see as we emerged from the elevator and out into the SFMOMA rooftop pavilion.  For months, we had been thinking about building a striped frozen mousse using a cone shaped mold, but we had to be practical about time and freezer space.  With the Robert Frank show about to come down (and therefore our float), another ice cream based treat to replace it was on our minds.

 Sometimes the artwork would tell us what it needed to be and this time it begged us to be an ice cream cone.  In this case, the perfect flavor and hue of ice cream already existed, so it didn’t take much to call up our friends at Humphry Slocombe to send over a couple of buckets of their Strawberry Sorbet (Salted Caramel replaced this in the winter) and Malted Milk Chocolate to match the sculpture. Our true work would lie then on creating a custom cone wrapper (and eventually, on the warm days, non stop ice cream scooping).
 Here is Caitlin’s first test. Turns out some extra math was required, as we needed the stripes to match up just right.
 Where we would often find ourselves toiling away in the kitchen testing recipes, trying to get flavors and textures just right, this time we brought out the paint box to engineer a custom sleeve so we could transform what was once was a brown sugar waffle cone into… a Cragg cone!
 Before Modern Art Desserts (the book) came along, a photographer from the SFMOMA had been the primary chronicler of our desserts. Charlie Villyard, member of the installation crew and talented photographer, would come up every few months and document all of the goodies we had been making. And one of our very favorite shots he ever took was this one of our Tony Cragg ice cream cone.
 Here he is, doing whatever needs to be done to get the shot right. But quickly, before the ice cream melts!
 Since the Cragg piece was installed in the pavilion and not the main galleries, it was one of the rare occasions in which you could eat the dessert you ordered right in next to the artwork that inspired it.  An even rarer occasion was purposefully scooping ice cream directly onto the floor!
 After a visit to SFMOMA from LA, a relative of mine gave me this.  He had saved his cone wrapper, collaged it onto a photograph he took of the Tony Cragg piece and put it in a frame.
 Sometimes a sculpture inspires an ice cream cone.  Sometimes an ice cream cone inspires a collage.
 You can see the Cragg Cone (in its upright state) and the recipe on page 155 of Modern Art Desserts. And in case you want to dress your cones this summer in stripes, we made a template that you can download here.
 Today we celebrate National Ice Cream Day with a couple of art-inspired ice cream sandwiches! You can thank President Ronald Reagan, who in 1984, designated the third Sunday in July as National Ice Cream Day.  Clearly exhibiting his good sense when it comes to sweets, he carried on to proclaim the entire month of  July as National Ice Cream Month.  In the proclamation, President Reagan (who also had an affinity for jelly beans!) called for all people of the United States to observe these events with “appropriate ceremonies and activities.”

 Caitlin’s sketchbook detailing Joel Shapiro Ice Cream Sandwich recipe and flavors.
 We designed this dessert- a layer of strawberry and then lavender ice cream sandwiched between two vanilla ice box cookies (one with a black stripe and the other with a yellow stripe) for the  2011 SFMOMA Art Auction.  When SFMOMA asked us to do a special something for the upcoming art auction, we explored a few ideas before settling on this ice cream treat based on Joel Shapiro’s 2008 Untitled pastel drawing.  Earlier on, we mocked up thoughts for  Liz Larner chocolate dipped potato chips in which house-made potato chips would be dipped in a black cocoa-tobacco chocolate shell.  We considered a mondrian-style cake that reveals a colorful Mark Grotjahn burst.
 Leah’s sketchbook brainstorming desserts for SFMOMA 2011 Art Auction.
 The Joel Shapiro ice cream sandwich was a rendition of our Agnes Martin version we created  in 2010 while her paintings were on view for the exhibition, Calder to Warhol,  introducing the Fisher Collection and celebrating the museum’s 75th anniversary.  Subtle bands of cream, parchment and a glaze of creamy yellow inn Martin’s painting Wheat were translated into delicious, quiet layers of rose mastic ice milk, chamomile ice cream contained between two buckwheat biscuits. 
 Over the years, we created a few more art-inspired ice cream-focused treats, which can all be found with inspirational stories and recipes in the Modern Art Desserts book.  Hopefully there are enough of them to get you through to the end of this ice cream focused month… consider it your patriotic duty to enjoy them!
 Not long ago, I mentioned baseball in a post and assured you it would be the only time you would catch me referencing sports.  Since then,  I have attended two Giants games at AT&T park and a few days after that listened to the Mets playing the Giants in the kitchen, while I was playing with cookie dough. 
 At the stadium, watching the game live,  I had a bit of a hard time following the innings and strike outs, as I found myself more taken by the bountiful bouquets of cotton candy bouncing up and down the stairways across the stadium.  Or the way a vendor would hand a churro to a customer as if they were passing the baton in an Olympic relay.  The best , though, was the fellow, armed with a holster of whipped cream around his waist, who floated up and down our row suited with a back pack of hot chocolate.
 Surely by now you are wondering where this is going or get to the part about baseball already.  Perhaps by now you are imagining Modern Art Desserts taking their Pop Art Corn to the bleachers? Or the Mondrian Cake served up alongside garlic fries and beer?   As these thoughts fleeted around between innings, so did the image of the late San Francisco artist, Jay DeFeo flying a Giants banner from the fire escape of her Fillmore Street apartment while “The Rose” (1958–66) is removed via forklift.   
 The Jay DeFeo Trust posted this gem right as the Giants sweep the World Series in 2012 and DeFeo’s masterpiece was about to go on view at SFMOMA for her revelatory retrospective. During the exhibition walk through, one SFMOMA curator noted were DeFeo, an avid Giants fan, still with us today, you can bet she would have skipped the exhibition opening for the Giants homecoming parade. 
 Although we have yet to make desserts (marshmallows!) based on baseball bases, we did create a dessert, our version of an Ile Flottante, based on one of DeFeo’s works that we offered while it was on view at SFMOMA. 
 The Illustrated History of the Universe is an oil painting featuring a deceptively simple white disc floating asymmetrically against an impasto grey ground. Its complexity lies in how the layered textures convey three-dimensionality.  I love that you can see the artist’s handprint on the bottom left. 
 So, although I can’t give you a play-by-play of the nine innings of the Giants game I attended since my attention was drawn to other things, I can give you step-by-step instructions on how to knock this DeFeo dessert out of the park.  The photos that follow were all taken by Willa Koerner - at SFMOMA (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art).
 Step 1: sift the powdered sugar.
 Step 2: beat powdered sugar with egg whites. //  Step 3: pile the sugar + egg mixture into a piping bag- and also fold caramelized cocoa nibs into fluff before loading the mixture into the piping bag- details, details!
 Step 4: Pipe the meringues (an Ateco 808 tip is what we used).  // Step 5: Bake meringues at 200 degrees for 1 hour and let them cool in the oven overnight.
 Step 6: Dip the meringues in (all organic) chocolate magic shell.
 Step 7: Allow the shell to harden in a cool spot and remove from sheet tray.  Store in freezer until ready to serve.
 Step 8:  Spread the the creamy base (which is a black sesame creme anglaise) like you are applying an impasto layer of paint to a canvas.
 Step 9:  Float the meringue on the creme anglaise and sprinkle with charcoal sea salt.
 Step 10:  Eat, enjoy!  And then maybe take yourself to a ball game.
 When one thinks about art and tomato soup, Warhol’s screen prints of soup cans probably come to mind.
 Here is Caitlin pointing them out when we were visting MOMA during our visit to New York last spring.
 Warhol’s screen prints might also come to mind when one thinks about themes of seriality and repetition in art.  So too might Minimalist artist Donald Judd's  stack pieces that focus on “real materials in real space” and their purity of form.
 Donald Judd, Untitled, 1973; stainless steel and oil enamel on Plexiglas, 114 in. x 27 in. x 24 in. (289.56 cm x 68.58 cm x 60.96 cm); Collection SFMOMA, Purchase with the aid of funds from the National Endowment for the Arts and Friends of the Museum; © Judd Foundation / Licensed by VAGA, New York; photo: Ben Blackwell
 Last year when his painting Untitled 1962 was on view as part of the Permanent Collection exhibition on the 4th floor of SFMOMA, we made a minimalist soup in reference to the minimalist work.   Donald Judd’s birthday was last week and I wanted to make this soup for the occasion and float a candle in it, but it has been outrageously warm here and it didn’t seem right to post about a hot soup.  That said, word on the field is that Dirty Girl Farms just got their second wave of tomatoes in the ground this weekend that will be ready for harvest in August.  If you can’t wait until then, or are eager to make this soup for someone’s birthday like we were, you could use the whole peeled tomatoes by Jovial.
 The day we photographed this up on the SFMOMA rooftop last year, was a perfect day for soup. 
 And while this soup does a lousy job at holding a birthday candle it really does look like Judd’s Untitled!  Have a look for yourself!
 Epilogue:  It occurred to me that Donald Judd and Andy Warhol have more in common than repetition in art.  They also have tomatoes…or would have had tomatoes in common had we actually gone through with this Bloody Mary Jell-o we were testing in response to this savory palette self portrait. 
 This sketch by Caitlin is far more delicious than the Jell-o itself.  Trust us, eating paper would be more delicious than eating this particular Jell-o.  And although this is a place where we will share other failed attempts at creating edible artworks, this is the only time we will ever speak of this particular (and epically disgusting) Jell-o.

 Surrounded by the sights and smells of the region during his youth, Mr. Espresso’s founder, Carlo Di Ruocco, set out to master the art and science behind coffee roasting and blending of classic espressos true to the region. We believe he did just that, and today Mr. Espresso is proud to offer Carlo’s interpretation of a timeless classic. True to its roots, Neapolitan Espresso is sure to delight the senses whether it is prepared at home with a stove-top “Caffettiera Napoletana” or expertly crafted at your neighborhood espresso bar.
 Cupping notes : Rich chocolate, Praline, Toffee
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Our goal with Organic Neapolitan was to create an espresso blend that contained similar attributes as our conventional Neapolitan using only coffees that are Fair Trade certified and grown without the use of agrichemicals. Complex, intense and rich in both flavor and aroma, Organic Neapolitan Espresso is the perfect balance of taste and social responsibility.
 Cupping notes : Meyer lemon, Brazil nut, Cocoa finish
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 “Triestino” Espresso refers to Trieste, Italy – which is the capital city of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region in Northeast Italy. The Port of Trieste is Italy’s and one of Europe’s great coffee ports, supplying more than 40% of Italy’s coffee.   Lighter bodied than our more traditional espresso blends with a smooth body and creamy mouthfeel; the rich nut-toned cocoa flavors of this blend are accented by lively fruit notes.  The flavor profile of the Espresso Triestino is inspired by the style of espresso which is normally consumed in this region.
 Cupping notes : Rich chocolate flavor, Stunning aromatics and Sweet resonant finish.
Roast level : MEDIUM
 “Tuscan Espresso” refers to the region of Tuscany, Italy – which is known for its role as the birthplace of the Renaissance, simple yet wonderful cuisine, and a wine producing region to which the Napa Valley is often compared to for both quality and beauty.  The flavor profile of our Tuscan Espresso is inspired by the style of espresso which is normally consumed in this region.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Licorice, Caramel
Roast level : MEDIUM
 If you are anything like us, the urge for an espresso can hit you at just about anytime day or night. With this in mind, we searched out and found the decaffeinated coffee dreams are made of (or at least allows for the sleep to dream). The rich golden crema, syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of licorice and caramel might just change your mind about how good a decaf can be. This is the perfect blend to pair with a dessert, or as one. Feel the freedom to indulge.
 Cupping notes : Cocoa-caramel, Fruit-tones, bold body
Roast level : MEDIUM
 The challenge in creating a blend that reflects the ideal characteristics of a truly delicious espresso is too often compounded by the availability and quality of the decaffeinated coffees on the market. Organic Decaffeinated Espresso is a challenge met. Thick, golden crema and cocoa-caramel aromatics that follow into the cup with distinct, yet subtle fruit notes. Perfectly balanced in milk drinks and alive with flavor as a straight shot.

 The Hartmann family’s coffee has become a Phil & Sebastian staple. They take an innovative approach to quality and are constantly experimenting with varieties and processing methods. Sebastian is continually involved in giving feedback and discussing new directions. It’s a true partnership.
 Ratibor is in charge of R&D, quality assurance, roasting, and sales. He is also a certified Q Grader. Allan is in charge of processing, manages the beneficio (wet and dry mills), and is also a carpenter. Alexander is in charge of the farm management, picking schedules, and ensuring coffee tree and vegetation health. Kelly is the mechanic, and works on the many numerous machines that run the mill. Lastly, Alice, the lone sister, is in charge of administration, accounting, and running the various bird watching and nature tours that go through their farm. Naturally, the families of each sibling also contribute and together they form the Hartmann “clan”, as they are affectionately known. 
 Over the past five years Sebastian has made many visits to the Hartmann family farm. During these visits, he has worked with the Hartmanns on improving many aspects of their business and production. The dedication the Hartmanns exhibit to the quality of product is admirable, and makes for a wonderful partnership. 
 In 2013, the family improved drying procedures by increasing their quantity of drying beds, which allowed the coffee to dry slowly. In 2014, the Hartmanns worked to better their selection of ripe cherry. In 2015 they raised the bar with the storage of some of their parchment in climate control and in 2016 they improved their dry-milling techniques, resulting in coffee that is cleaner and has even better shelf life. 
 Sebastian and Ratibor had a great visit this past February, during which they discussed some improvements that will be happening at the Hartmann farms for 2017, but also visited Ratibor’s new farm, which will begin to produce next year. This is exciting because it will be the highest elevation farm for the family and will produce a number of exotic and exciting coffee varieties.

 Robinson Figueroa is a stand out among his coffee producing peers.  As a 3rd generation producer, he focuses on quality production over quantity.  When visiting last, we were excited to see Robinson planting a part of his farm with geisha & bourbon varieties.  With plans in place to build his own wet mill, we expect great things from Robinson in future years.
 This offering is a delicious anchor on our offerings menu with flavors of white wine, vanilla, & baker’s chocolate.

 We are happy to be working with Scott Rao to sell his books officially in Europe!  It holds it own as the most concise, and thorough book on coffee brewing available.
 Everything But Espresso is Scott Rao's follow-up to his acclaimed The Professional Barista's Handbook. Rao instructs the reader in how to brew coffee on a professional level using various non-pressurized brewing methods, such as French Press, manual drip, and the vacuum pot. The book is divided into three parts: Part One explains the ins and outs of coffee extraction and measurement. Part Two offers detailed instructions on how to optimize various coffee brewing methods. And Part Three deals with water chemistry and green bean storage. Whether you're a professional barista or a serious amateur coffee lover, this book is the essential guide you need to master manual coffee brewing.

 Thin paper filters ideal for use with the Hario V60 Pour Over, a nuanced and versatile brewer.
 For use with Hario V60 brewer

 Ideal for use with the Hario V60, which is great for brewing technique explorations. The brewer’s large opening allows for a faster brew, depending on how you pour. These high quality filters help brew a clean cup. 

 
              Nuanced and versatile, the Hario is an elegant brewer for those who want to perfect the pour. It’s great for folks who are looking for complete control over brewing extraction. The key here is to pour slow. The entire brew process for a 10oz mug takes about three minutes. 

            
 
              Learn how a filter affects your cup quality. 

            
 These coffees are the result of nearly thousands of samples cupped, and many miles logged. It's the result of multi year commitments by producers to grow, pick, and process exciting coffees. Enjoy!
 Division was designed to exhibit the fervor of mulitple elements in alliance, creating a rich & complex profile of dark sugars. We crafted this offering on the foundation of rich chocolate and caramel notes with just enough sweet, dark fruit overtones to make it an exceptionally versatile coffee. Primarily intended to serve as a brewed offering, this coffee has been shaped to serve as a Fair-Trade & Organic alternative to Orion, our flagship espresso.
 Division was created to be paired with food. The rich body holds up well against heavier traditional breakfast items. Inversely the fruit tones are held in careful balance to compliment a wide range of pastries and desserts. Although sweetness is clearly present in the cup, it is not overpowering. We created this offering to showcase the versatility of a carefully balanced cup. This makes Division an exceptional choice for cafes and restaurants looking for a “work horse” coffee. We like to think of this offering as the nicest “diner coffee” you will ever find; perfect for bookending your day.
 Although the elements shift occasionally to reflect the seasonality of coffee harvests, we are careful in our selection of what we pair in Division. While looking for rich, sugared tones we make sure we are working with a seasonally rotating selection of reputable cooperatives, known for consistent quality and fair practices.

            The ROK Coffee Grinder is a refined and functional tool, designed to help you achieve a precise and effortless manual grind for any brew style.
          
 Requiring less than half the revolutions of a standard manual grinder, the ROK Coffee Grinder is quick, efficient and immensely easy to use, due in large part to the long handle, stable base and bevel gears with self-lubricating properties. While we love a quality electric grinder as much as the next brewer, there’s something to be said about employing a little elbow grease to achieve a precise grind, and with the ROK, doing so in about the same amount of time! It only takes about 30 seconds to grind the amount of coffee needed for a double shot of espresso. With a sleek design to boot, this grinder has got it all!

 The wheels of fate turn in mysterious ways. Sometimes they need a little help from us mere mortals. Luis Pedro Zelaya Zamora is one of those guys who greases the wheels.
 It’s been six years since we met, and every year we’re more impressed with the great Guatemalan coffees he helps us find. Along with the farms run by his family, he keeps his Bella Vista mill (which processes both his family’s coffees and those of his neighbors) in top working order.
 Three years ago, we were in Antigua, cupping with Zelaya. We’d bought from one of his neighbors for a few years straight, and every year they produced a tiny amount of coffee. But that particular year they produced even less than usual. Ever resourceful, Zelaya added some extra, neighboring farms to our cupping.
 His idea was to make sure we’d buy enough coffee to make importing it efficient. But what he got was a couple Four Barrel folks constantly pestering him about this anonymous “neighboring” coffee that blew us away on the cupping table.
 Eventually we discovered that the “neighboring” farmers really were his neighbors‐‐practically next door to Bella Vista.  The Yuc (pronounced “yook”) family farms sit scattered around the Volcan de Agua, and they somehow produce the absolutely exquisite florality we treasure in Guatemalan coffees. Apparently, the wheels of fortune are spinning in our favor.
 
    We challenge you to brew coffee without equipment. Can't do it? We're here to help. Each item in the equipment shop has been tested in our café and in our homes and we think they're perfect for your kitchen. Experiment and have fun!
 
            We really love Costa Rica: the people, the landscape, and, most importantly, the coffee. Our love affair with sourcing from this country began in 2010, and in that time we’ve been lucky to partner with many great producers and mills. What’s most exciting about Costa Rican coffee is the producers have the education, means and incentive to invest in their farm and turn their coffees from great to truly exceptional.
        
 Espresso: Felipe Rodriguez // Costa Rica
 Filter: Gillio Francesa // Costa Rica
 Filter: Miguel Rojas // Costa Rica
 On our first visit to Costa Rica we established a friendship and partnership with Juan Ramon Alvarado and Francisco Mena, the owners of Exclusive Coffee, at the time, a start-up boutique exporter. Through this partnership, we have established some amazing relationships and forged some meaningful friendships with producers.
 In 2010, we began working with Ricardo Perez and Marvin Rodrigues, owners of a mill called Helsar de Zarcero. This partnership has flourished as we have invested in working with several of the mill’s best producers and have devel-oped long-standing relationships with them. Over the past five years, we have expanded our scope to include some great relationships with producers across the country from the West Valley to Tarrazu.
 Most notably, we have worked on two projects with Helsar: one to improve the drying of the coffee and help improve shelf life and another initiative to help farmers pick better coffee cherry. We have seen success with both of these initiatives but, while picking culture has proven hard to change, our drying projects have proliferated and have now been implemented with all of our partners.
 The drying projects involve significant commitment from each producer. The infrastructure is not simple, the logistics are detailed and the amount of time required is onerous. We work closely with each producer to ensure that this process goes smoothly and we visit their farms two or three times a year to help them make any necessary tweaks. We have seen great results from these projects and have seen significant improvements in how long they last without losing vibrancy. We communicate throughout the year and provide feedback to the producers, always thinking about projects for the upcoming harvest.

 We would never tell anyone to “follow” anyone else on any sort of social media “platform” or anything else. But if you had been wasting your life following us back in the summer of 2015, you would have noticed that we visited a place called Rwanda.
 You might have seen our photo of a coffee mill worker garbed in a white lab coat, or other photos of Simbi, which ranks among the cleanest and most highly organized mills we’ve ever encountered.
 We didn’t “post” (as the kids say) photos of the density channels and multiple c-bends that progressively ensure quality as coffee gets washed at the Simbi mill. But they exist, and they’re part of Simbi’s great hybrid of every washing system we’ve ever seen: density, washing, tanks–all in beautiful condition and working in concert.
 Simbi itself is only three years old, and has produced incredible coffee every year. This is the second year that we’ve bought it. The owner, Abdoul Rudahunga, built it to match his vision. He has designed impeccable raised beds leading directly downhill to a natural mountain spring, among other feats of engineering.
 On the human side, he’s dedicated himself to maintaining a good relationship with his farming neighbors and employees. We heard over and over that Simbi was a great working environment–IRL, as we say.

REGION: Apaneca, Ataco
VARIETAL: Bourbon
FARM: Las Cruces/Jasal
ALTITUDE: 1515 M
FARMER: Jose Antonio Salaverria
ROAST: Medium+
NOTES: Honey process, 94 Points by Coffee Review

 
Our 94 point espresso returns along with it's sweet blast of caramel, brown sugar and molasses flavors. Followed by a creamy dark chocolate and orange finish, The Las Ranas will definitely get your day going! 

    Owned and operated by JASAL, the home of renowned producers Jose Antonio Salaverria, Cerro Las Ranas takes its name from a lagoon that is populated by thousands of frogs (Hill of the Frogs). 
    

    Cerro is the pride and joy of Don Jose Antonio and since the devastating Santa Ana Volcano eruption in October, 2005, he has restored the farm to pristine shape. Ripe, red cherry is picked and delivered to Las Cruces Mill where it undergoes a process pioneered by JASAL that is now becoming more and more common throughout Central America. The cherry is processed normally but the coffee is then immediately sent to the clay drying patios still covered in the sticky mucilage where it is laid out and constantly raked and turned to ensure even drying. 
    

    This process (called Pulped Natural or “Miel”,honey-processed) imparts a subtle sweetness and fruit note, lending an atypical complexity to the cup.
    

94 Points by Coffee Review

Blind Assessment:

    Complexly structured: quite sweet with a tart and bitterish balance. Honey, tangerine, dark chocolate, hints of flowers and apricot in aroma and small cup. Full, buttery mouthfeel. The short finish is sweet and gently flavor saturated; the long turns richly drying. Pronounced presence in milk: fat-bodied, chocolaty, with a hint of flowers.

 You can subscribe to  Giant Steps.
 A blend of organic coffee that is quite dark and chocolaty. Maybe a bit more one-dimensional than the Bella Donovan, but it is a good dimension. Giant Steps is delightfully fudgy and thick in a French press or drip pot, and stands up to cream quite well. If it were any heavier-bodied, you could pour it on pancakes.

 It’s been many years since a coffee from Papua New Guinea has been on our menu, and it hasn’t been for lack of wanting. This lot from the Aiyura Valley in the Eastern Highlands is from a 34 Hectare washing station/ plantation owned by a gentleman named Sero Bebes - and what a fantastic job done by those who delivered to this station!
 Papua New Guinea is home to many Typica and Bourbon selections, including ones like Arusha, and Blue Mountain. When we cupped this initially, with clean, articulated notes of Aloe juice, tropical fruits, and zippy raspberry, we knew we needed to share it with you.
 For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:

But for expediency’s sake, let’s put it this way: The opascope is a tool for taking careful craftsmanship and opening it up for everyone to access and enjoy. Sound familiar? Available only in the Bay Area and online, the three-component Opascope Espresso is a refreshing addition to a lineup once dominated by dense, chocolatey selections. It yields an effervescent shot, packed with stripes of tropicalia.

 Sweetheart Espresso is sourced, roasted, and brewed for the sweetest espresso possible and it comes from Direct Trade farmers who are close to our hearts! Ben and Kristi Carlson are Americans who moved to Burundi with a dream to facilitate meaningful and direct relationships between coffee roasters and coffee farmers by producing great coffee and telling the stories of the people who grew it. The Long Miles Coffee Project is the fruit of their dreams and an important part of building a strong coffee sector in one of the poorest countries in the world. As part of the project, the Carlsons built a mill in the community of Bukeye and Kayanza where they purchase coffee cherries from the surrounding three hills, including Nkonge. During last year's harvest, Olympia Coffee sent staff to live and work alongside local farmers, cupping lots of coffee daily, resulting in this selection. To learn more about our work in Burundi, check out our video Coffee, People, Potential at olympiacoffee.com/videos.

 When designing our seasonal blend Telemetry, we look at our entire lineup of single origin coffees from that season, and think about the flavors each varietal is bringing to the table, and how they may work together to create a blend that is sweet, bright, and rounded in its flavors and character. 
 We've designed the component series to allow you to explore the construction of Telemetry. Each pack includes a 4oz bag of each Telemetry component, as well as a 4oz bag of Telemetry itself. Taste them separately, or together, and build your own understanding of how we structure our blends, and how unique flavors can work together to create something really special.

 Beautiful as espresso, drip or anything in between, this is our signature organic blend.
 A bright burst of citrus pairs beautifully with creamy notes of caramel and hazelnut.

 From all over the world, the beans come to us. A cup of Holler Mountain combines chocolatey Latin American textures with the brightness of fine east African beans. It’s an incredible versatile blend.
 Although the coffee comes from all over, each of our producers has something in common: the cherry are picked at the height of ripeness and carefully processed. Clear flavors of blackberry, citrus and toffee shine through in a creamy, full body.
 The ASOPEP cooperative represents 160 families growing coffee near the towns of Planadas and Ataco in Tolima, Coloimbia.  These small farms average only 2.5 hectares in size and grow Caturra, Castillo, Colombia, and Typica varieties of coffee.  Processing is done on the individual farms using traditional fermentation and a mixture of solar and mechanical drying.  The cup is rich and complex with notes of brown sugar and orange peel with a bright acidity.

 Huckleberry · Orange Blossom · Juicy  
 This variant is currently sold out
 Please fill in the form below if you'd like to be notified when it becomes available.
 Tart and concentrated, this honey-processed Gesha exhibits both the intensely sweet and juicy qualities of huckleberry with a hallmark Gesha florality akin to orange blossom.
 The Gesha Cultivar is considered by many coffee professionals, connoisseurs, and enthusiasts to be the most intense, complex, brilliant cultivar ever discovered. Though Gesha gained its current acclaim from crops cultivated in Panama, its origin can be traced back to the fertile land on the slopes of southwest Ethiopia. From the birthplace of coffee, Gesha was transported across the world’s foremost coffee producing countries, finally landing on the shores of Central America in the 30s. Because of its unique traits from plant to cup, Gesha has built an unparalleled name for itself, and now we have access to the greatest cultivar ever discovered grown on some of the world’s greatest farms.
 "A place very far away and hard to get to", as defines the word "Jurutungo," is the name of Graciano Cruz' farm in Western Panama.
 In the seventies, Jurutungo was a freshly planted farm in western Panama near the Costa Rican border in a region called Piedra Candela. Jurutungo was planted with Catuai, Caturra and a modest hectare of the Gesha variety.
 In 2009, Graciano Cruz took over the overgrown farm and reinvigorated the land by stumping the existing trees and allowing them to regrow. The result; the rebirth of some of the world’s oldest gesha trees on one of the highest farms in Panama.
 A North American exclusive offering, Evelia Maria Honey Gesha celebrates “old-vine” character and terroir of one of the most intriguing farms we’ve come across to date.

 La Serrania is an exceptional decaf offering comprised of coffees produced and processed in classic southern Colombia small holder farmer fashion. Several producers throughout Colombia’s Huila department contributed to this lot. The relatively new method of decaffeination is accomplished using ethyl acetate created from Colombian-grown sugar cane. The result is a sweet and round cup which presents red fruit, cocoa and guava.
 Fresh coffee is roasted every Sunday, Monday and Wednesday and shipped the following day. Please place your order by 5:00 PM Eastern Time the evening before the respective roast day to ensure that it is included.

 Floral and lightly fruity, Meadow is like a summer breeze. The blend of Rooibos and chamomile is soothing and sweet. Caffeine free.
 Ingredients: Egyptian chamomile, South African rooibos, fragrant hyssop, linden flowers, lemon myrtle, rose petals, safflower, cyani flowers and natural flavors.

 Meadow is a blend of golden Egyptian chamomile flowers and mildly stimulating, fragrant hyssop joined with smooth Cape rooibos, rose petals and linden flowers. Rooibos has a tea-like flavor without the astringency of black tea.
 Rooibos, also known as red bush, grows about 250 km north of Cape Town. Introduced to Egypt from Europe a half century ago, chamomile brings the joy of festive harvest to the city of Fayoum. Here, the Nile provides ample water and fertile soil for the world’s finest tasting blossoms. Harvest season for these golden buds is January to April.
 It’s been many years since a coffee from Papua New Guinea has been on our menu, and it hasn’t been for lack of wanting. This lot from the Aiyura Valley in the Eastern Highlands is from a 34 Hectare washing station/ plantation owned by a gentleman named Sero Bebes - and what a fantastic job done by those who delivered to this station!
 Papua New Guinea is home to many Typica and Bourbon selections, including ones like Arusha, and Blue Mountain. This coffee is very versatile and we knew it would be a great addition to our espresso offerings.
 Here are the parameters that we've been using with Papua New Guinea Sero Bebes (parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket)
 Stout and creamy with caramelized flavors of chicory root

 Two hundred years before we started selling our coffee in San Francisco, the French brought coffee
infused with stout, caramelized flavors of chicory root to the shores of New Orleans. Blended with
creamy whole milk and organic cane sugar, our ready-to-drink, cold-brewed version pays homage
to that tradition in a sweet, nostalgic carton.

 Our road trip-ready iced coffee is made of three simple ingredients: coffee, water, and time

 Designed to inspire adventure and movement, our portable cans promise days on the trail, at
the beach, and camping with friends-in one adorable and sustainable package. The taste is luminous
yet dense, bright yet chocolatey, small yet powerful.

 Jam-like in both texture and its intense sweetness, Worka combines a dynamic florality with mulling spice and wild berry flavors.
 Sourced from among the 300 members of the Worka Cooperative, Worka owes its distinct complexity and clarity to not only meticulous processing featuring a Gaviota demucilager and channel-washing system; but the staggering altitudes and mystical terroir surrounding the Worka Kebele in Gedeb. It's needless to say, we're pretty head-over-heels for coffees hailing from this small but mighty community.
 Upon it's 2005 inception, Worka joined the twenty-six other member cooperatives affiliated with the Yirgacheffe Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union (YCFCU). Benefitting over 45,000 member smallholder farmers, The YCFCU is committed to supporting a sustainable coffee supply from cooperatives in the Gedeo ethnic region of Ethiopia.

 This coffee was a magic carpet ride for us. Starting with the depth of Figs, zigging to the sweetness of a Mango, and zagging to the end with a splash of White Grape Juice. It's a whole new world.

 Yellow Bourbon is a natural cross between Red Bourbon and Amarelo de Botacuto, which is labelled as a Typica variant with yellow fruit. Bourbon resulted from selections made by French botanists in wild Yemeni coffee groves. Moved to controlled fields for propagation, the relatively humble stock produced a remarkable variety and was given the namesake of its nursery - Bourbon Island - upon its introduction to South American. Under expanded cultivation in Brazil, a yellow mutant with a unique flavor profile expressed itself and was isolated, expanded, and named for its color.
 This Variety Select lot comes to us courtesy of five small farmers from the villages surrounding the municipality of Iquira. With volcanic soil, anaverage temperature of 20-25° C, and 160 CM of annual rainfall, this area is extremely conducive to the cultivation of coffee. Generally, these farmers are processing only ripe cherries the same day of harvest using a dry fermentation of 18-24 hours. The coffees are then washed, and dried in parabolicos for an average duration of 12-18 days.

 Lots of love from Ethiopia. Muscovado Sugar and Jasmine start the journey and they fall into a bed of Apricots. We can't stop. 
 Region: Shakiso, OromiaFarm: Kayon Mountain Varietal: TypicaAltitude: 1900–2200 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed & Sun Dried
 The Kayon Mountain Coffee Farm is owned by multiple families that have been born and raised around the experience of coffee. These share-holding members had mainly been supplying coffee to auction for the past 30 years until they started their farm in 2012. This farm boasts a 500 hecatarespread, of which half is planted in heriloom Typica coffee and the other land reserved for cabbage, and indigenous shade trees. By 2015, they had implimented washing stations and dry-hullers allowing them to start exporting their own coffees and now see an annual production of about 300 tonnes. The coffees see an average fermentation time of 24-26 hours, followed by an average drying time of 12-20 days. As for the future, Kayon Mountain plans to plant more coffee, improve the quality of their processing, and even begin leasing more land to expand their practice.
 The ECX was started in 2008 to help protect farmers from market forces that might prevent them from making a living. Most of the coffee in Ethiopia is produced by small-holders who own 0.7 hectares, bumper crops often lead to big price drops, which can make it unprofitable for farmers to harvest their coffee. What the ECX does is commoditize grains- including sesame, beans, maize, wheat, and most importantly, coffee. This ensures prompt payment to farmers. It also integrates all parts of the “eco-system” involved in a grains market, including warehousing, grading, trading, and payment. Access to information is emphasized, as farmers can obtain information about trading prices and local delivery points easily through dedicated telephone lines.
 Here is a general rundown of how the ECX chain works in Ethiopia:
 While this system does ensure prompt payment and streamlines supply chain issues, it removes essentially all traceability from the coffee. This is problematic in the specialty world, where traceability is paramount.
 The ECX does not allow for complete traceability, but coffee cooperatives in Ethiopia do have the ability to go around the ECX and export the coffee themselves. Coffees that are exported by a cooperative can have traceability, possibly even to a single farmer.

 Why You'll Love it: There are two types of people, those who have had a life-changing cup of Ethiopian coffee and those who haven't. This coffee has a proven power to open your mind to the flavor possibilities of coffee. So whether this coffee is a revelation or causes you to reminisce, you'll love this coffee.
 Story of the bean: The cross-pollination and continual evolution of heirloom varieties of Ethiopia create this wonderfully complex cup of coffee. After the ripest cherries have been harvested the coffee seeds remain within the fruit during the drying process endowing this coffee with a heavier body and an intense berry sweetness.
 In 1992 in Ethiopia's Great Rift Valley anthropologists discovered Ardipithecus Ramidus, a 4.4 million year old hominid fossil. This fossil represented a paradigm shift in the understanding of human evolution and inspired the name of this distinctive coffee that changed the way we think about naturally-processed Ethiopians. In an ever-evolving specialty coffee industry La Colombe is proud to offer this heirloom Ethiopian year after year.

 Ever since we've been exposed to "Sugar Processed" Decafs, we've fallen in love. Ethanol is used to extract a solvent found in sugarcane, which extracts the caffeine. Definitely the gentlest non-chemical decaffeination, and to boot this is done in the same country as the coffee was produced, Colombia, also a rarity in decaffeination. Honestly, this just tastes like a really beautiful coffee from Colombia, it just happens to be Decaf.
 ﻿All of our coffee is now flushed with nitrogen when bagged, creating an inert atmosphere that improves freshness. An unopened bag of coffee can now retain freshness for 4+ weeks.

 This amazing coffee from the Uraga co-op (belonging to the Oromia Cooperative Farmers Union) is grown at elevations between 1900-2200 m and consists of heirloom cultivars. The coffee is washed processed, carefully and slowly sun dried, and meticulously sorted to give us amazing uniformity. 
 This is absolutely one of our favorite coffees; it has a jammy lushness and taste notes of peach cobbler, honey, lots of florals. It is simultaneously crisp and refined and soft and juicy.
 We won a Good Food Award with a lot from last year's harvest and we're thrilled to see this coffee back on our menu for the third year in a row.

 An absolute stunner. This sweet and creamy coffee is new to us this year and is wowing us with every cup. 
 We overheard someone from our coffee team describe this one like a “pancake breakfast,” warm and buttery with maple syrup sweetness. Quickly becoming a staff favorite.

 This project is a first step towards sourcing incredible new coffees from producers we’ve never worked with before. After a few days of 12-hour cupping marathons, our coffee team selected these top-tier lots out of hundreds for our El Nevado coffee. The end result has exceeded our expectations and we look forward to developing many new relationships here.
 Across the high peaks of Southwest Colombia, you’ll find the departments of Nariño, Tolima, Huila, and Cauca. You’ll also find some of the best coffee in the world.

    This is a "natural" processed decaffeinated coffee or otherwise known as the sugar cane method. Let us take you to Dorkville real quick to provide some insight one what this specific decaffeination process is and how it affects the overall flavor of the coffee. Basically there are four basic decaffeination process that we know of or have been introduced so far. They are the Direct Solvent, Indirect Solvent, Swiss Water and Co2.  
    
    For this specific coffee, we're going to focus on the Solvent based process. Now don't freak out. Let us expand on what this process actually is. To simplify, this processes is when the caffeine is removed from the beans with the help of a chemical solvent, such as methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. Those solvent based processes in turn can be divided into methods using the “direct” method and the “indirect” method. 
    
    This specific coffee goes through the "indirect" process. What that mean is, instead of applying the solvent chemical directly onto the beans, the beans are soaked in near boiling water for several hours, which extracts the caffeine as well as other flavor elements and oils from the beans. The water is then separated and transferred to another tank where the beans are washed for about 10 hours with either methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. The molecules of the chemical solvent selectively bond with the molecules of caffeine and the resulting mixture is then heated to evaporate the solvent and caffeine.
    
    Lastly, the beans are reintroduced to the liquid to reabsorb most of the coffee oils and flavor elements.
However, because of the impracticality of gathering natural ethyl acetate and its cost, the chemical used for decaffeination appears to be synthetic. Ethyl acetate is produced commercially from ethyl alcohol and acetic acid, which in turn may be produced from natural ingredients or petroleum derivatives.
In the direct method caffeine is removed by soaking the materials directly in a solvent; the solvent is directly applied to the beans. 
    
    Las Serranias is graded "A" decaffeinated process that uses a derivative from sugar-cane known as Ethel Acetate (EA). The pleasing characteristic from the sugar cane adds to the sweet acidity and banana, apricot and cream notes. More importantly, It's not giving the dirty flavors most decaffeinated coffees are associated with. Overall, it's a well structured, smooth, and balanced coffee.
    
    Although Las Serranias is not a part of the Las Mingas Project directly, it was produce by the founders. Las Mingas Project promotes coffee relatinships, a partnership that brings producers, exporters, and roasters together to collaborate. Giving farmers bargaining power and receive honest pricing for trading practices. La Serrania came directly from Virmax, a premier exporter of Colombian Specialty Coffees that works under Direct Relationship model. 
    
    Without a doubt, decaf drinker or not, you will appreciate and adore Las Serranias. Kenneth Davids from Coffee Review scored Las Serranias 89 points and stated this decaf as "delicately rich and fruit-toned. In the aroma distinct cocoaish chocolate complicated by fresh-cut fir. In the cup soft, wine-like acidity, lightly syrupy mouthfeel, and continued fruit-inflected chocolate."

 Coffee is a seasonal fruit and we source it directly from origin in freshly harvested lots. We practice small production methods that allow us to scrutinize and perfect our processes. Attaining a perfect roast is an intuition, a smell, a sound, a slight change in color— it’s about careful attention to detail that comes through in every cup. 
 Our company takes its name from the 'sightglass,' the viewing window on our vintage PROBAT coffee roaster that exposes the complex and delicate process of roasting coffee. We believe that knowing the story behind your coffee—where it was grown, how it was processed, and who handled it along the way—is a powerful link from the cup to the wider world. 
 Ultimately, we aim to deliver the highest quality achievable in all aspects of our business, whether that be sourcing the most beautiful and wondrous coffees attainable or employing the most mindful and quality-focused practices possible. 
 Sourcing green coffee is at the heart of what we do at Sightglass. It is meticulous and essential work. Processing methods, varieties, growing altitudes, climate, soil and farm conditions are a few of the many factors that shape and determine a coffee’s overall quality. Being present at origin allows us to see these factors first hand and ultimately, helps us determine the best expression of each coffee we work with.
 Roasting is the transformation of green coffee from a raw product into something that will be consumed. We view roasting as one piece of the larger collaboration between our farmers, sourcing partners, and finally baristas and home brewers. Our objective as a coffee roasting company is to recognize the intentions of the people who have contributed to producing our coffees and express these intentions through our work.
 Sightglass began as an aspiration to source, produce, and share distinctive, quality-focused coffees.
 In 2009, we began with a small, rickety service-cart in San Francisco’s SoMa district. Equipped with a few Chemex pots and a leaky vintage 2-group espresso machine, we served coffee to the neighborhood just behind a roll-up garage door housed in a sturdy 1914 built warehouse. People came to visit us, and remarkably, even came back to taste more. Two years and many coffees later, the entirety of this warehouse would become our production roastery, a dynamic & unconventional coffee bar, a community gathering space, and our company headquarters.
 Today, our company still operates out of this location, and we've grown a bit, in large part due to our dedicated supporters and steadfast coffee producers. We’ve evolved to comprise a nexus of distinctive shops, an incredibly dedicated, talented and unwavering staff, and an unparalleled network of partners within our wholesale program, whom entrust us to supply their establishments with dazzling coffees. 
 Your support of our pursuit is everything.

Why - Supports concepts of more individual responsibility, capability to act quickly and independently.  Should increase job satisfaction and improve understanding of risks and rewards.  While delegation is critical, there is a small percentage of high-impact issues that need or require involvement of higher levels within the business and within the company.  Humility: What - Modesty, lacking pretense and not believing that one is superior to others. Why - It’s all about maintaining our pride about who we are, about our achievements, about our worth – but without arrogance.  It’s about being content to let others discover the layers of our talents without being boastful.  Those who achieve the most brag the least, and the more secure they are in themselves, the more humble they are.  
 In 6th century Ethiopia, a goatherder named Kaldi stumbled upon his wandering flock as they sampled berries from nearby bushes. Ordinarily sluggish, his goats had an unusual amount of energy. After tasting several seeds himself, Kaldi discovered that the berries were the cause for the increased energy. It wasn’t long before coffee beans and their stimulating effect traveled far and wide.

  We have been part of developing the Oslo cup series from Figgjo together with designer Kristin Hærnes Ihlen from Physical Design and Figgjo. Therte are three different cups in the series. All made to enhance the drinking experience:
 "Tulipan" (Tulip) is designed for coffees with lower acidity like typical Bourbons from El Salvador, Brazil or Indian coffees. The cone shaped cup enhances more earthy aromas and gives you an impression that the coffee is very sweet as the liquid enters the mouth in a narrow stream and hits the middle of the tongue.
 "Splitt" is designed for coffees with intense fruity and floral aromas and bright acidity. Typically we use these cups for our Kenyan and Ethiopian coffees. The unique design enhances the aromatics when you smell the coffee in the cup and the wide shape makes the liquid enter your mouth with a wider spread so that you percieve acidity more clearly.
  "Åpen" (open) is more of an allround cup. The classic U-shape is a forgiving shape when it comes to taste balance yet it has the ability to intensify aromas when you smell the coffees. We typically use these cups for coffees that has fruity characters and medium intense acidity. 
 The fun part is that you can play around with the different shapes with different coffees and change your guests perception of how the coffees taste like.
 A reusable cup that you’ll want to reuse.
 A KeepCup Brew is just like the original KeepCup, but made of durable tempered glass. It's the perfect vessel to enjoy the sensory pleasure of a coffee experience while on the go. Get one in 8 oz or 12 oz.

Processed by the Ethiopia Coffee Exporter Company owned by Grima Edima it brings together some of the best lots produced by the heirloom cultivars indigenous to the region. It features notes of raspberry and milk chocolate, with a citrus acidity in a coffee that makes a great espresso, drip, or french press option.

            Lush flavors of pear preserves and lychee meet aromatic notes of pipe tobacco in this syrupy sweet and balanced cup. 
              Whole Bean, 8oz

 The AAK Brothers coop is a collaboration of three different coops in the Eastern and Western highlands of Papua New Guinea: Apo from the East, then Angra and Kange from the West. Each of these names means “brother” in their respective local languages. By joining forces, these three coops are not only making coffee production and processing easier, they have created a very unique flavor profile, bringing foundation and body from the West and the lighter top end from the East. Recently, the AAK Coop has been able to set up three washing stations in key areas for members to use, and has grown their arsenal of 80+ small stations that offer technical assistance and agricultural education for members to continually cultivate better harvesting practices. All of these aspects combined make for an expressively transparent and unique cup that is unmatched in the vast majority of Indonesia.

 Blackberry jam / Sage Honey / Arnold Palmer
 Arnulfo Leguizamo is the example of what a Colombian coffee farmer should aspire to be. Based on his reputation for consistently exceptional coffee, he has become one of the most recognized names amongst coffee producers throughout the world. In 2011, when he won the Colombian Cup of Excellence, with Primavera, his first farm. That year his coffee commanded the unprecidented price in the COE auction of $45 a pound. With that money he was able to take his family on vacation to see the ocean along with investing his winnings into his farms. He is a leader within his community, passing his experienced knowledge along to other memebers of the Association Los Naranjos, a 97 member farmer group which has established a strong reputation in it’s own right. Along with exhibiting the ability to produce outstanding cup quality year after year, Arnulfo has become a strong leader within his community, passing his experienced knowledge along to others. We are proud to be able to offer his coffee as our newest Imperial Reserve.
 Arnulfo Leguizamo’s Finca Primavera leads with flavors of lemon, apricot and honey before developing sweet tones of blackberry cobbler and Dubble Bubble gum. There is an herbal tannin in the finish that pairs well with the blackberry sweetness and turns the lemon notes into an Arnold Palmer. The clarity, delicateness, and sweetness are a testament to the skill Arnulfo has developed in his years of experience. This is the perfect coffee to drink on the porch on these warmer summer days.

 This is a new delivery of San Juan, fresh crop and full of the first part of the harvest. These pickings are beautifully sweet and fruit forward.
 Under Luis Pedro’s supervision, the coffee is shaded entirely at the beginning of its life at the farm. This year completes the 3 year cycle of pruning and maintenance through most of the farm. The idea was to renovate in thirds - pruning every third row, allowing the row immediately behind it to receive more sun and hence have more production, mitigating declines in overall yield. This is typical practice for San Juan, and the farm is looking exceptional. The focus on agronomical practices is quite outstanding, from soil renewal, irrigation control to pruning and picking - this is a year round project that brings us some of our favorite coffees from Guatemala.
 Producer: EXC
Varietal: Ethiopia Heirloom
Region: Guji
Elevation: 1800-1950 meters
Process: Fully Washed
Drying: Sun-dried on raised beds
Mouthfeel: Juicy and clean
Aroma: Marshmallow, Lime & Graham Cracker
Tasting Notes: Lychee, Grapefruit, Green Grapes and Dark Chocolate
 The 91-point Banko is unique among its fellow Guji coffees. The Banko is very aromatic, with intoxicating notes of marshmallow and graham cracker, which helps set it apart from other coffees from Guji. Exciting notes of lychee, paired with its juicy and clean mouthfeel make the Banko an easily drinkable, and very palatable coffee.

 San Agustin coffees are characterized by dense fruit and intense sweetness. Bodied and structured, these coffees exhibit dried-fruit acidity and aromatics.
 There's something about San Agustin. Precipitous and deceptively difficult to access, Huila's southern-most municipality sits in the Eastern foothills of the "Macizo Colombiano" - a sort of hub where three spokes of the Andes connect. In other words… Mountains. Here, nestled in the Macizo Colombiano, lie the headwaters of the formidable Rio Magdalena - Colombia's largest and most important river. 
 In San Agustin, small-holder farmers average just a few hectares. Cherries they pick are de-pulped using manual, hand-cranked de-pulpers before soaking in small plastic or tiled tanks for 18-24 hours. Afterwards they're set to dry in typical parabolic driers (greenhouse-like, tarped enclosures that allow light to penetrate heat, but shield drying coffee from wind and rain). 
 Colombia La Magdalena celebrates three smallholder farmers - Alejandra Bravo, Segundo Urbano and Carlos Imbachi - who exemplify the potential of this lush micro-region.

 Grown in Sidamo, right outside Yirgacheffe, Deri is collected from various private washing stations within the region. This lot is purchased out of the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX); as are all private washing station coffees as per Ethiopian law, rendering full traceability dubious at best. The struggle with getting sweet, clean, delicious coffee out of this region absolutely relies on the people working each day, tending to their trees, and only delivering ripe fruit. This is easier said than done when you have countless smallholder farmers to work with, but those who deliver to the washing stations in this region do a fantastic job.
 With lush forests and incredible biodiversity, as well as commitment to quality, this is such a special place. We do hope that one day there will be ability to seek full traceability on lots like these. With the ECX barcode system that is slowly being rolled out as of last year, we are on the way to seeing that happen. 
 With soft honey aromatics, and vibrant flavours of meyer lemon and yellow plum, this is a stunning example of a fresh crop Sidamo coffee.
 For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:

 We are happy to be working with Scott Rao to sell his books officially in Europe!  It holds it own as the most concise, and thorough book on barista training available.
 FROM THE AUTHOR: When I began in the coffee business fourteen years ago, I read every book I could find about coffee. After reading all of those books, however, I felt as if I hadn't learned much about how to make great coffee. My coffee library was chock-full of colorful descriptions of brewing styles, growing regions, and recipes, with a few almost-unreadable scientific books mixed in. I would have traded in all of those books for one serious, practical book with relevant information about making great coffee in a café. Fourteen years later, I still haven't found that book. I know many other professionals as well as some obsessive nonprofessionals would like to find that same book I've been looking for. This book is my attempt to give it to them.

                            The coffee is hand picked by the farmers and their families. After delivering the coffee to the wet mill the good coffee cherries are separated from the inferior ones. The cherries are depulped and graded by using an old disc de-pulper that uses water and gravity to sort dense beans from less dense beans. The beans are dry fermented for about 12-16 hours over night in one tank, then transported to a second tank with water where the fermentation is continued for up to another 30 hours depending on the climate and amount of mucilage left. After fermentation the coffee is washed and graded in the evening before it gets  dried on african elevated drying tables, where defect parchment coffee gets sorted out. The coffee is dried to a moisture between 10-12% and stored in conditioning bins before delivery to the dry mill.                      
 We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our light roasted coffees are suited for all brew methods except espresso. The roast level gives a cup with clarity, brightness and sweetness with little  bitterness and ashy flavors from the roast process.

If brewed as espresso on an espresso machine, the lighter roast style will result in a cup with a very high level of acidity due to the highly concentrated brew. We therefore recommend using our slightly darker roasted coffees for making espresso.
 All our coffees are packed in vacuum sealed, recyclable plastic bags that are flushed with nitrogen before seal- ing. The bags has a one way valve to let the coffee de-gas while quality is kept in the sealed bag.

When the coffee is roasted it develops a lot of CO2 gas inside the beans. This gas will make the coffee taste smokey and ashy immediately after roasting. It is abso- lutely crucial to let the coffee degas and rest for a while before use to ensure maximum flavour.

We recommend storing / degassing our ligher roasted coffees for minimum 3 to 5 days after the date of roast , sealed in the original bag at room temperature, before you use it.

Make sure you store it in a dark place at around 14°C - 20°C, away from any heat, moisture or light. The coffee has lost most of its sweetness and aroma 3-4 weeks after the day of roast, so make sure you use it before it is too late.

You can find the roast date and batch number on all our coffees in the bottom right corner of the front label on the bags. 
 We strongly recommend to use correct measurments and brewing techniques when you brew our coffees. Use a digital scale both to measure water and coffee in order to get consistent results.

We recommend to use between 60 to 70 grams of coffee per litre (1000g) of water, depending on the brewing method, water quality and coffee used. 
 We start with the highest quality coffee, cold brew it without heat for over 12 hours, then use a double filtration process to procure the end result: a complex, smooth and full-bodied brew with low-acid and a chocolate finish. Feelings of invincibility and euphoria are likely to follow.
 You don't do dairy. Say no more. We've mixed our life-affirming Cold Brew with the finest coconut cream from Sumatra, Indonesia for a dairy-free, vegan game changer. Coconut Cold Brew is made with three natural ingredients so separation is bound to happen. For a good time, shake it like you mean it.

 Different types of coffee have different sizes and densities, so weighing your coffee is a foolproof way of getting your dose right. 
 We like the JScale because it’s tough enough for everyday use in our cafes and you can use batteries or the included AC adaptor.

    Our standard shipping option is a $6 flat-rate through UPS SurePost.
 
    We offer other options through UPS Ground that are calculated during checkout for quicker transit time. 
 
    We roast Sunday through Thursday. Once you place your order, you can expect it to be roasted and shipoed within 48 hours. Orders placed closer to the weekend may have to wait longer.
 
    Delivery time for UPS SurePost is dependent upon how far you are from Grand Rapids, Michigan but is anywhere from 1-5 days. We also offer 3 Day Select, 2nd Day Air and Next Day Air if you need your coffee to arrive sooner. Place your orders accordingly! Once your order is shipped you will recieve an email with your tracking number. 
 
    We do! If you have questions regarding your international order please feel free to email us at roast@madcapcoffee.com before you place your order.
 
    Of course you can. We strongly encourage you to grind your own coffee to achieve an optimum flavor experience but we will grind coffee on request. Select the appropriate grind in the shopping cart.
 
    All of our coffees are given a roast level that we feel brings out their best flavor. For us, roasting goes beyond color, which is why we focus more on sharing flavor profiles rather than information on the roast itself. The majority of our coffees are somewhere in the medium-light to medium roast range.
 
    We are happy to answer, neither. We've developed a way of sourcing coffee that we really believe in and that we feel, at least for us, works better than Fair Trade or Direct Trade. Madcap spends time every year visiting our producers and building relationships on the farm level. We work closely with every link in the supply-chain to ensure that quality and sustainability are top priorities. When buying coffee from farms we haven't yet visited, we use well-established organizations to assist with sourcing that are aligned with our core beliefs and interest in transparency. So in essence, our coffees are both fairly traded and directly traded, just not certified.
 
    Like all produce, coffee is seasonal. With our sights focused on quality, we purchase our coffee during harvest and only feature it while it lasts, usually about three or four months. We know it can be frustrating to fall in love with a coffee and then have it soon disappear, but think about how exciting it will be next year when its season rolls back around.
 
    Simply use the bag your coffee comes in, keeping it rolled up tightly and out of the sunlight. We encourage you to use your coffee within one month of the roast date and keep it away from the freezer. Every time you freeze your coffee a Madcap barista loses a tip.
 
    There are numerous ways to make coffee and no single way is correct. But here's some main pointers:
    1. Use filtered water. Water makes up 90% of your final product, so water quality plays a huge role.
    2. Make sure your water is between 200-205 degrees Fahrenheit. This is necessary to properly extract the awesome flavor.
    3. Grind coffee fresh right before brewing.
    4. Use roughly 10 grams of coffee for every 5 ounces of water.
    5. Have fun and drink responsibly!

 For pour over pros, a kettle like this is a must. The Hario Buono has a long and slender spout which allows for slow and precise pouring. 
 If you want to step up your pour over brew game, perfecting your pour is key. Hario’s slim spout gives you maximum control for even water distribution.

 Marda Loop features light wood panels, high ceilings, and a long coffee bar. We wanted the space to be warm, inviting and elegant, but look different than the average cafe.
 Our menu is constantly changing with the seasons and mirrors our coffee program.
 Our food philosophy is quite simple. There’s peace of mind in knowing where our food comes from – that the ingredients we use are from small, quality-driven farms, mostly located right here in Alberta. These ingredients are usually only found in high-end restaurants (accompanied by high-end restaurant prices), but we’re committed to using these same artisanal ingredients in a casual cafe menu. Here are some of the producers we work with: Vital Greens, D Dutchmen Dairy, The Fresh Squeeze, Coco Karamel, Winter’s Turkey, Ewe-Nique Farms, Sylvan Star Cheese, Highwood Crossing, Yum Bakery, Valbella and Sidewalk Citizen.
 Marda Loop also features a variety of baked goods, treats, sandwiches, soups and salads. We roast our meats in house and make nearly everything in house. We bake most of our baked goods ourselves daily in the Marda Loop kitchen.
 Our friendship with Aviv Fried started back in 2008 and we’ve been working with him and his bakery, Sidewalk Citizen, ever since.  Over the past year, we decided to work more closely together and offer a wide range of Sidewalk Citizen treats at the cafes.
 Love our Marda Loop cafe for more than just your morning coffee? Host your next meeting or event in our space and discover what else it can do!
 For more information about booking your next event contact our very own josie@philsebastian.com or visit our cafe rentals page.
 Phil & Sebastian love a good party, so bring them and a carrier of freshly brewed coffee with you to the next one – we promise they won’t tell any cheesy jokes.
 Call or visit any of our locations to bring Phil & Sebastian to your next gathering. To learn more about your options visit our catering page.

    We've been proudly featuring Fair Trade/Organic coffees since 1999 and throughout that time we've developed longstanding relationships with a number of co-ops that provide us with exemplary coffee year after year.
            
 Cupping notes : Sweet-smoky, Tamarind, Layered
Roast level : DARK
 Our Organic Colombia Tolima comes from the municipality of Planadas in the southern tip of the Tolima Province. Lying in the foothills of the Central Andes, Tolima is known for its mineral-rich soils and fresh water. Though relatively unknown in the coffee industry until recently, Tolima is now the country’s third largest coffee producer and is increasingly being recognized for producing great tasting coffee.
 The beans in this lot come from two small cooperatives in Planadas: ASOPAP and Resguardo Indígena Nasa We’sx.
 The 29 members of the ASOPAP cooperative are fully committed to quality coffee and organic standards from their farms, which are situated at 5,400-6,200 feet. Their beans have yielded excellent cup profiles for some time, drawing attention from international coffee traders.
 The Nasa We’sx are an indigenous community brought to Planadas in the early 1900s by the Colombian Army as a mine workforce. For decades, they were caught in the conflict between the army and the largest guerilla group in the country, FARC, until recently, when they made a peace pact with local guerrillas.
 Cupping notes : Smooth smoke,  Caramelized sugar, Silky body
Roast level : DARK
 This is our darkest Fair Trade/Organic certified blend. We thoughtfully selected the coffees that make up this blend in order to maintain some of their individual aroma and flavor attributes while standing up to the intensity of the unique way that we roast them. The result is a dark roasted coffee with smoky flavor, peppery body and just a hint of caramelized sugars ; a perfect way to ease into your morning and a great complement to an evening meal.
 Cupping notes : Sweet Chocolate, Sweet Caramel, Fruit toned acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Originally created as the companion to our Golden Gate House Blend, this espresso has a sweet chocolate flavor complimented by notes of fruit and caramel along with a well balanced acidity. It is a harmonious blend of Fair Trade and Organic certified coffees.
 Cupping notes : Chocolate, Sweet Caramel, Fruit toned acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Whether approaching by sea or from within the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Strait imbues a sense of magic and wonder. The stunning landscapes and picture perfect sunsets inspired us here at Mr. Espresso to create a blend that attempts to capture its grace and majesty. Dark chocolate, sweet caramel and fruit toned acidity seamlessly blend together to create our homage to this wonder of nature.
 Cupping notes : Strawberry jam, Milk chocolate, Currant
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Guaya’b is a cooperative of over 300 indigenous Mayan and Quichua farming families in the region of Jacaltenango, Huehuetenango. Since the introduction of coffee into the Jacaltenango region 40 years ago natural habitats, flora and fauna have slowly made a comeback from the once de-forested land. The recreation of the natural habitat has allowed for the reduction of soil erosion, restored natural habits and given the coffee crops a lush canopy that allows them to ripen slowly. Rich & delicately fruity; you’ll experience a thought provoking brew that begins with a chewy, chocolaty body that develops into a strawberry jaminess infused with deeper, bright fruit tones that suggest currant and raspberry.
 Cupping notes : Red danjou pear, Raspberry honey, Malt-like body
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Situated deep in the interior folds of the Southern Sierra Madre Mountains in Chiapas, Mexico is the coffee growing cooperative of Ramal Santa Cruz. Among this multitude of coffee farms lies the home of Augustin Sanchez Espinoza and his three brothers who all farm together on adjacent parcels of land. The farms of the Brothers Sanchez are at the upper reaches of viable coffee cultivation, starting at 1600 meters and topping at just over 1800 meters, the highest of all coffee grown in the cooperative. The family began planting coffee on the land in the early 1970s. Many of the original plants are still producing. The majority of the coffee is Typica and Bourbon with a scattering of more recently planted Caturra.
 The coffee from these four brothers and their farms make up our Mexico Fair Trade, Organic, Ramal Santa Cruz , Cuatro Hermanos.  This coffee greets you with a  red danjou pear citrus acidity followed with hints of raspberry honey and Meyer lemon.  We hope you will enjoy this extraordinarily smooth coffee from the Cuatro Hermanos.
 Cupping notes : Rich chocolate, Hazelnut, Mellow acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Our goal with Organic Neapolitan was to create an espresso blend that contained similar attributes as our conventional Neapolitan using only coffees that are Fair Trade certified and grown without the use of agrichemicals. Complex, intense and rich in both flavor and aroma, Organic Neapolitan Espresso is the perfect balance of taste and social responsibility.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 A blend of Fair Trade and organic certified coffees. Seven Bridges Blend is a velvety bodied blend with depth and a complex, multilayer flavor dynamic. A favorite among customers and chefs alike, this blend can be found at some of the finest dining establishments around the San Francisco Bay Area.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Modeled after our Organic Seven Bridges Blend, this blend has all the positive characteristics of the Organic Seven Bridges Blend without the caffeine. A good alternative for after dinner enjoyment or simply for those who are caffeine sensitive. The blend is 99.9% caffeine free.
 Cupping notes : Cocoa-caramel, Fruit-tones, bold body
Roast level : MEDIUM
 The challenge in creating a blend that reflects the ideal characteristics of a truly delicious espresso is too often compounded by the availability and quality of the decaffeinated coffees on the market. Organic Decaffeinated Espresso is a challenge met. Thick, golden cremaand cocoa-caramel aromatics that follow through into the cup with distinct, yet subtle fruit notes. Perfectly balanced in milk drinks and alive with flavor as a straight shot.

    A little over 3 years ago we were in a bind. The Ethiopian coffees we had coming in for the season were all running late and we really wanted a fresh vibrant Ethiopian coffee to get on our menu for the interim. In that search, we stumbled upon Reko, a coffee that ended up being so much more than we could ever have expected and we bought up as much of that harvest as we could. Now, Reko has become a staple in our line-up.

    Our Director of Coffee, Ryan Knapp, had the chance to visit the mill a few months after we purchased our first harvest from Reko and he has cupped through nearly every batch of coffee they have produced each season. Aside from the elevation of the mill, which is as high as we’ve ever seen (at up to 2,200 meters), the mill itself operates very similarly to others in the area. They have long 36-hour fermentation times after the coffee is pulped, they thoroughly wash the coffee in long channels followed by a 12-hour soak, and then the coffee is dried on raised beds for about 2 weeks while workers pick through the parchment to clean it up.
 
    Like many excellent coffees, what really separates Reko from the others is in the details. The first thing we noticed was the pride the team at Reko took in their product. The specific care taken when evaluating the fermentation tanks, the strenuous effort placed into the washing, and the precision used at the drying tables demonstrate their passion for their work. All along, the workers were smiling, often singing and chanting as they processed the coffee. The team at Reko has a lot to be proud of as they continue to produce such a special coffee year after year. In 2015 our Reko was a Good Food Award winner, and  we’ve secured a large amount of Reko this season and expect to have it around through 2016.

REGION: Timana, Huila
VARIETAL: Castillo, Caturra
FARM: La Esperanza 
ALTITUDE: 1500 - 1700 M
FARMER: Various 
ROAST: Medium 
NOTES: Winner Regional Select in Best of Huila 2016, Washed process
 
Our roasting team found sweet flavors of chocolate and honey on the nose with bright tangerine, lime acidity and a creamy chocolate body in the cup.  With subtle hints of tart cherry, sweet spices and floral notes, this coffee will taste great hot or iced!
    
    Best of Huila is a cupping competition created for roasters and green buyers to pick the very best coffees they can find. The top 12 coffees out of 750 submissions were cupped, ranked and auctioned where the roasters bid on their favorites. Our new coffee from Colombia was the highest scoring regional coffee cupped at the event where Mike Perry was earlier this year. It also comes from the ASOCAMPO cooperative in Timana where the 1st Roasters United event was held, and where Mike met the famous Yuri Maryeth Cuellar Rojas. 
    
    The international jury in Colombia found this coffee to be a classic Huila with notes of spicy fruit, sweet chocolate and creamy body when hot. 
As it cools down, it presents bright orange, lime and raspberry notes. 
Timana is a small, coffee-centric town on the road between Neiva and Pitalito in the department of Huila, Colombia.

 Yellow Bourbon is a natural cross between Red Bourbon and Amarelo de Botacuto, which is labelled as a Typica variant with yellow fruit. Bourbon resulted from selections made by French botanists in wild Yemeni coffee groves. Moved to controlled fields for propagation, the relatively humble stock produced a remarkable variety and was given the namesake of its nursery - Bourbon Island - upon its introduction to South American. Under expanded cultivation in Brazil, a yellow mutant with a unique flavor profile expressed itself and was isolated, expanded, and named for its color.
 This Variety Select lot comes to us courtesy of five small farmers from the villages surrounding the municipality of Iquira. With volcanic soil, anaverage temperature of 20-25° C, and 160 CM of annual rainfall, this area is extremely conducive to the cultivation of coffee. Generally, these farmers are processing only ripe cherries the same day of harvest using a dry fermentation of 18-24 hours. The coffees are then washed, and dried in parabolicos for an average duration of 12-18 days.

 Region: Shakiso, OromiaFarm: Kayon Mountain Varietal: TypicaAltitude: 1900–2200 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed & Sun Dried
 The Kayon Mountain Coffee Farm is owned by multiple families that have been born and raised around the experience of coffee. These share-holding members had mainly been supplying coffee to auction for the past 30 years until they started their farm in 2012. This farm boasts a 500 hecatarespread, of which half is planted in heriloom Typica coffee and the other land reserved for cabbage, and indigenous shade trees. By 2015, they had implimented washing stations and dry-hullers allowing them to start exporting their own coffees and now see an annual production of about 300 tonnes. The coffees see an average fermentation time of 24-26 hours, followed by an average drying time of 12-20 days. As for the future, Kayon Mountain plans to plant more coffee, improve the quality of their processing, and even begin leasing more land to expand their practice.
 The ECX was started in 2008 to help protect farmers from market forces that might prevent them from making a living. Most of the coffee in Ethiopia is produced by small-holders who own 0.7 hectares, bumper crops often lead to big price drops, which can make it unprofitable for farmers to harvest their coffee. What the ECX does is commoditize grains- including sesame, beans, maize, wheat, and most importantly, coffee. This ensures prompt payment to farmers. It also integrates all parts of the “eco-system” involved in a grains market, including warehousing, grading, trading, and payment. Access to information is emphasized, as farmers can obtain information about trading prices and local delivery points easily through dedicated telephone lines.
 Here is a general rundown of how the ECX chain works in Ethiopia:
 While this system does ensure prompt payment and streamlines supply chain issues, it removes essentially all traceability from the coffee. This is problematic in the specialty world, where traceability is paramount.
 The ECX does not allow for complete traceability, but coffee cooperatives in Ethiopia do have the ability to go around the ECX and export the coffee themselves. Coffees that are exported by a cooperative can have traceability, possibly even to a single farmer.

 We devote constant attention to Big Truck and think it might be the best organic espresso blend you can find. Coffee is a seasonal fresh produce and different producing countries have varied seasons and harvest periods. We strive to buy smaller lots in their prime to keep the blend as fresh as possible. The ingredients of the blend change based upon seasonality, yet the flavor profile for Big Truck remains the same.

            A great single origin is a truly exceptional coffee that highlights the intrinsic qualities of that region while being able to stand on its own as a unique and enjoyable cup of coffee.

 El Manzano Caturra Microlot is sourced from the Luis Gómez family farm in the small department of Nariño—roughly the same square area as the state of Maryland. Nariño borders Ecuador and the Pacific Ocean, but has an extremely diverse geography. Hot plains lie on the Pacific Coast, lush Amazon tropics occupy the central region, and the Andes Mountains traverse north to south along the inland border.
 It is this Andean region that put Nariño on the map as a top coffee producer in the 1990s, when high-volume coffee buyers turned to the region’s farms as source of choice for its excellent coffee. This trend discouraged farmers from producing higher priced, premium coffees.  As these buyers migrated much of their business to other countries, premium coffee demand simultaneously increased and farmers saw an opportunity to sell their unique offerings. Collaborations have resulted, building a network of resources for these farms.
 Luis Gómez and his family have justly reaped the benefit of this shift. The Gómez farm has seen improved efficiency, increased earnings from their coffee sales, and strengthening of their family’s livelihood.

 Our Organic Colombia Tolima comes from the municipality of Planadas in the southern tip of the Tolima Province. Lying in the foothills of the Central Andes, Tolima is known for its mineral-rich soils and fresh water. Though relatively unknown in the coffee industry until recently, Tolima is now the country’s third largest coffee producer and is increasingly being recognized for producing great tasting coffee.
 The beans in this lot come from two small cooperatives in Planadas: ASOPAP and Resguardo Indígena Nasa We’sx.
 The 29 members of the ASOPAP cooperative are fully committed to quality coffee and organic standards from their farms, which are situated at 5,400-6,200 feet. Their beans have yielded excellent cup profiles for some time, drawing attention from international coffee traders.
 The Nasa We’sx are an indigenous community brought to Planadas in the early 1900s by the Colombian Army as a mine workforce. For decades, they were caught in the conflict between the army and the largest guerilla group in the country, FARC, until recently, when they made a peace pact with local guerrillas.

 To drink a cup of Ethiopia Nigusse Lemma is to connect with the origins of coffee.  Beans from Ethiopia’s Limu woreda (district) deliver unique flavors that can only be discovered in heirloom varietals.  Located in the southwestern part of country, Limu is not as well known as Yirgacheffe or Harrar, but deserves the attention that it is receiving.
 Our Ethiopia Niguisse Lemma is sourced from the family farm of Lemma Edeto and is located in the highest elevations of the Limu region.  Shade from old growth trees, water from spring fed stream, and native varietal of coffee that flourish organically are in no better hands than the Edeto Family.  Lemma, with over 60 years in the coffee industry, has passed down the knowledge to his sons Nigusse and Haile, who operate the farm which their father recovered after it was confiscated by the Derg regime in the 1970’s.  The family’s commitment to quality includes a fully natural dry processing that insures no unripend cherries taint the taste of the finished product.  Fully control from farming to milling has resulted in award-winning coffee.  Nigusse and family were recently honored for the African Taste of the Harvest competition awarded by the African Fine Coffee Association.

 This coffee comes to us from the farm of Welser Hernandez, just outside the town of Jacaltenango in the Huehuetenango Region of Guatemala. It’s here that Mr. Hernandez grows and processes his coffee—in the Sierra Madre Mountains that lie in the Western Highlands of the country. Though growing altitudes range from 4,300-5,900 feet, the dry, hot winds from the Mexican plains fend off the threat of frost, naturally protecting the vegetation. After harvest, the beans—predominantly Bourbons and Caturra—are fully washed, then sundried, yielding the coffee bean that we call “Guatemala Mr. Hernandez”, in honor of his commitment to quality.
 Cupping notes : Milk chocolate, Medjool Dates, Raspberry
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Guaya’b is a cooperative of over 300 indigenous Mayan and Quichua farming families in the region of Jacaltenango, Huehuetenango. Since the introduction of coffee into the Jacaltenango region 40 years ago natural habitats, flora and fauna have slowly made a comeback from the once de-forested land. The recreation of the natural habitat has allowed for the reduction of soil erosion, restored natural habits and given the coffee crops a lush canopy that allows them to ripen slowly.
 Rich & delicately fruity; you’ll experience a thought provoking brew that begins with a chewy, chocolaty body that develops into a raspberry jaminess infused with deeper, bright fruit tones that suggest currant and strawberry.
 Cupping notes : Red D’anjou Pear, Raspberry Honey, Malt
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Deep in the interior folds of the Southern Sierra Madre Mountains in Chiapas, Mexico is the coffee growing cooperative of Ramal Santa Cruz. Among this multitude of coffee farms lies the home of Augustin Sanchez Espinoza and his three brothers who all farm together on adjacent parcels of land. The farms of the Brothers Sanchez are at the upper reaches of viable coffee cultivation, starting at 1600 meters and topping at just over 1800 meters, the highest of all coffee grown in the cooperative. The family began planting coffee on the land in the early 1970s. Many of the original plants are still producing. The majority of the coffee is Typica and Bourbon with a scattering of more recently planted Caturra.
 The coffee from these four brothers and their farms make up our Mexico Fair Trade, Organic, Ramal Santa Cruz, Cuatro Hermanos.  This coffee greets you with a red danjou pear citrus acidity followed with hints of raspberry honey and Meyer lemon.  We hope you will enjoy this extraordinarily smooth coffee from the Cuatro Hermanos.

 Situated near a gorilla habitat in the mountains of Central Rwanda, the Dukunde Kawa is a cooperative of 2000 member farmers, more than 80% of whom are women. Its award winning coffees and support from local and international sources have greatly benefited the producers’ families. In 2003, the cooperative was able to build its first washing station with funding from the Rwandan Ministry of Defense. In turn, the cooperative now donates 10 percent of its net profit annually to fund the construction of other washing stations throughout the country. Since receiving Fair Trade certification in 2004, Dukunde Kawa has implemented a direct training program and continued to improve the standard of living for its farmers.
 This coffee is 100 percent Bourbon varietal, grown at high altitudes ranging from 1,500 – 2,000 meters above sea level, which allows for slower ripening and cooler fermentation temperatures. The Bourbon cultivar and extended fermentation process, along with meticulous washing and sorting, produce a lush coffee with complex fruit notes.

 Our Sumatra Samosir Honey is a unique lot. It is the result of collaboration by three coffee growers from the Lake Toba region of Northern Sumatra. What makes this lot different lies in the coffee processing. Sumatran growers are known for using the unique process of “wet hulling” coffee. But these Lake Toban farmers have taken a still different approach using what is know as the “honey” process—a process originated in Central America but rarely used in Asia. The differences are not only interesting, they result in an entirely different flavor profile.
 The Wet Hulled Process, common to most Sumatran coffees, begins with the coffee being pulped and washed. This removes the sugary mucilage layer, as is done with all washed coffees. The difference with wet hulled coffees is, the beans are removed from their protective parchment layer before they have been allowed to fully dry. This premature exposure of the beans results in Sumatran coffee’s distinctive musty, earthy flavors. The Honey Process, used in producing this Sumatran, is named for the sticky mucilage found once the coffee cherry skin is removed. It is sometimes referred to as “honey”. During the Honey Process, coffee is fully dried with the sugary mucilage before the sugar laden parchment is removed from the bean. The result is a coffee with good sweetness and body but with flavors that are cleaner than traditional Sumatran coffee.

 Colombia boasts one of the most diverse landscapes for coffee production in the world. With regions that house a multitude of unique growing climates within a hundred square kilometers, the diversity of flavor profile is enormous.
 The Andes Mountain range cuts towards the Pacific Ocean shortly after it starts in the northern parts of Colombia. After passing Medellin, it starts to run through some of the most formidable areas for growing coffee in the world. Cauca, a plateau laden region with hundreds of small counties has the terrain to house thousands of farms in close proximity. Further south, Nariño is remote and filled with intense peaks surrounding its inhabitants. Producing coffee in Nariño is difficult for both its remoteness, and also for the intensely steep landscape. Both regions are known for dark berry flavors in the cup, like blackberry.
 The latest version of Streetlevel has coffees from both of these regions. These coffees are made up of lots from a handful of smallholder producers. Their farms range from one hectare in size to four. They process their coffees using motor driven de-pulpers and utilize waterless fermentation before drying on raised beds in greenhouses.
 Streetlevel Espresso works perfectly as your everyday espresso or as a brewed coffee. This version we have been liking pulled fast and medium in output.

 Immy Camarade is one of Rwanda’s many female entrepreneurs. In fact, she owns the gas station in Kigali where we picked her up for the drive out to her brand new Karisimbi mill. That mill, even in its young state, is part of the incredible transformation the Rwandan coffee industry has experienced over the last 20 years.
 That transition–from focusing exclusively on volume to adding the element of quality–happened at the processing level. The yummy Bourbon variety coffee, the volcanic soil, and the climate have always been there; infrastructure and habit were the only things to improve. Karisimbi mill is among those mills working exclusively with fully washed coffees, and accentuating excellence rather than sheer quantity.
 Of course, the country itself has gone through bigger changes than that. Rwandans really capitalized upon the assistance international NGOs have offered since Rwanda’s 1994 genocide. The country seemed to us to be one of the most clean, safe, and progressive places we’d ever been. On an individual level, Immy herself joined a businesswoman’s delegation that visited the US for entrepreneurial training, including a stint working with coffee folks like us.
 Immy’s nascent mill in Karisimbi is still a small and temporary setup. This year’s output–her first ever–was only around 1,300 pounds total. But she has pretty big plans, and we hope to partner with her for years to come.

 Amazingly complex and vibrant peaberry lot from the Gakuyu farmers cooperative in the Mathira East district of Kenya. It is composed of SL 28/34 cultivars grown at 1800 meters, washed and dried on raised beds. You'll immediately take note of its physical appearance: small, dense, rolled-up looking little peaberries. While that alone doesn't indicate quality potential, we certainly love the evenness and density of the small beans and how explosive this lot is! We are absolutely enamored with its clean, supple, winey profile. It's full package coffee, with notes ranging from raspberry to dark chocolate, mango, and honey. 
 12 oz / 340 g whole bean
 We roast and ship on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. Orders placed Thurs through Sunday will roast and ship Monday.

 Put your V60 and cup on a scale. Bring filtered water to a boil. Thoroughly rinse paper filter to get rid of paper flavor.
 Grind 22 grams of whole bean coffee. Settle it for an even coffee bed.
 Pull water off of the boil, and wait 45 seconds to a minute, or until the water is 200-205 degrees Fahrenheit. Pour 40-50 grams of water.
 Stir vigorously with your spoon or stir stick. This is to ensure all coffee is evenly saturated.
 Allow 20 seconds for a de-gas and then start pouring slowly into the center. To prevent water from escaping without extracting the coffee, your pour should be slow and your water line should not go far above the coffee line.
 When you have reached 360 grams of water, do a last stir to get the grounds off the side & do not leave any coffee high and dry!
 Your pour should take 1 min and 50 second or up to 2 min and you total contact time should be 2:20 to 2:30

 We are very happy to work with Daniela and Pedro Rodriguez in Bolivia. Bolivia a country struggling with both poverty and leafrust, this is means that farm volumes low and the makes paying the producers properly extremely important. Working together with Daniela and Pedro we are supporting their program Sol de Mañana which is educating the farmers in treatments   for leafrust and a higher price they can achieve for  higher quality. /Joanna Alm, Head roaster  
 In the small colony of Collasuyo in Caranavi region Nicolas Calque and his wife Maruja are doing a careful job at their process station. They have a farm called “ La Florida”  in Collasuyo of 12 hectares where they produce and process their coffee. Nicolas started in coffee industry 18 years ago. His neighbors recognize him as a coffee lover and at the age of 14 Nicolas went to live with grandmother  as his family were having economical problems. He started working as coffee picker, whilst his grandmother provided food and shelter.
 In 1999 Nicolas invested all his savings and bought a farm in the colony of Collasuyo where he dedicated his entire farm to produce coffee, but the prices they were receiving for their product were too low to cover the family costs. In 2010 Nicolas and his wife sold their farm and moved to Brazil to improve their quality of life. However, they soon changed their mind, ”It was not what I expected, I worked over 8 hour in a sewing plant, we lived with 20 families locked in a room in poor conditions.”  says Nicolas.
 Six months later Nicolas returned home to Collasuyo with his family and bought back the coffee farm in the farm from his savings. This has motivated Nicolas to produce more and tastier coffee. He’s a part of the program that Daniela and Pedro has, called Sol de Manana. Pedro and Daniela are exporting the coffee and finding a good market for it, they are also training the farmers to work for a higher quality with less leaf rust. This year Nicolas has planted two more hectares of coffee.

 Ingredients: A blend of high grown, hand picked Indian Darjeeling first and second flush teas.

 A traditional breakfast black tea, this organic blend of Darjeeling first and second flush tea produces a light yet complex morning cup.
 Nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas in northern India, Darjeeling, once a British hill station, is known for producing some of the world’s most prized and expensive teas. First flush begins in late March and lasts about 30 days. During the second flush, which begins in early May, the top two leaves and bud of each tea bush are plucked every seven days. Teas produced during this period have fuller flavor than teas from the first flush.

 Miguel Rojas is a small coffee producer from the picturesque region of Llano Bonito de Naranjo in the West Valley of Costa Rica. Miguel grows primarily Caturra, although he also has a bit of Typica “Villalobos” variety. The Villalobos certainly contributes to the elegance of his coffee. Miguel is known as one of the best partner producers of Helsar de Zarcero. Helsar is arguably the best coffee mill in Costa Rica and is owned and operated by one of the nicest and most genuine people we have met: Ricardo Perez. We have been working with Ricardo since 2010, and every year our friendship has been strengthened.
 We have been partnered with Miguel since 2012, but have followed his coffee closely since 2010.  His farm enjoys some of the highest altitudes in Llano Bonito. This altitude, coupled with the great care he has for his farm and mixed varieties, produces a very fruit-forward coffee with a very sweet and elegant acidity. Miguel also recognizes the importance of keeping his cherry pickers happy, so he pays them well above the minimum and demands very good quality picking in return.
 Sebastian has had the pleasure of meeting with Miguel a number of times now, and has developed a nice friendship and a good deal of respect for him. While Miguel spends most of his time on the coffee farm, he also has an interesting side business with his sons: he breeds cows. Although at first take this sounds like a fairly straightforward business, there are many idiosyncrasies that separate the good breeders from the bad…much like good coffee producers from bad. 
 Miguel is also part of a program we launched with Ricardo called “sangre de toro”. This term means bull’s blood, which is the colour the coffee cherries take on when they are picked very ripe. Sebastian pays Miguel a premium for exceptional cherry delivery and, in turn, Miguel pays his pickers more. The improved picking has resulted in a sweeter and more complex cup.
 This coffee went through an experimental drying protocol at Helsar this past year. Our drying experiments with Ricardo for the past four years have all been focused on lowering the temperature of the guardiolas and resting the coffee during the drying process. Every year, Ricardo has been lowering the air temperature in the guardiolas by a few degrees and extending the drying times. The end goal of extending these drying times is essentially to preserve both the quality and shelf life of the green bean. Through these experiments we have seen a remarkable improvement in shelf life year after year.

 ”Working together with the exporters Daniella and Pedro we are supporting their program Sol de Mañana which is educating the farmers in treatments for leaf-rust and how a higher price can be achieve for higher quality.

 Elda is a young women who together with her husband Felix Choquehuanca source beautiful cherries from the colony of Taypiplaya. During the day they both tend the land, pruning, clearing and picking the cherries.  
 At the end of the day both Elda and Felix hand sort the cherries for unripes and defects, knowing this will help them be selected as a micro lot. Then by Taxi they deliver their cherries to the Buena Vista mill Every night from 12 pm to 4 am where the coffee is processed.  If selected as a micro lot it is separated and then cupped at the mill to access its quality. Being selected means a higher price for the cherry, and can then go on to be a lot like this one. 
 They are now a part of the program that Daniela and Pedro has, called Sol de Manana. Pedro and Daniela are exporting the coffee and finding a good market for it, they are also training the farmers to work for a higher quality with less leaf-rust.

 Like surprise parties, camping trips and the supplest of beef briskets, cold brewed coffee is best executed with a bit of foresight. The Filtron method is, for our money, the most reliable and delicious way to get complex single origin iced coffee at home. It takes about 12 hours overall, but the rewards for a little patience are many: If you, like us, have ever stepped onto a forebodingly hot New York street at 7:13 a.m., groggy but determined, you know that each sip is its own reward.

 Measure out 2,000 grams (two liters) of water.
 Place the Filtron’s rubber cap in the hole at the device’s bottom.
 Wet your wool filter and place it snugly in the circular groove at the bottom of the Filtron. You’ll want to make sure this is in evenly; otherwise, you run the risk of getting an unsatisfying extraction.
 Unfold your filter and place it in the Filtron. It will be a bit of a loose fit, so be sure to secure it evenly and fold it where necessary.
 Weigh out one pound (454 grams) of coffee.
 Grind the coffee into a stainless steel bowl (or anything else that’s large enough and won’t leech flavor). Cold brew calls for a finer grind – similar to that of AeroPress.
 Add your coffee to the Filtron, then give it a few shakes to level the bed.
 Pour your water over the grounds – carefully, of course – in a series of concentric circles.
 Submerge the grounds with a butter knife or bamboo paddle.
 Position the plastic disc filter atop the filter, then place the plastic top component on top of that. It's possible to add the water through this top part, but we've gotten better results by pouring directly on. In this case, the top component will just serve to keep any errant materials out of your coffee. Let steep for 12 hours.
 Here’s where you’ll need a friend. Carefully position the Filtron over your carafe and swiftly pull out the rubber stopper. Often, you have a couple of seconds before the flow of coffee begins.

  "It’s now the third year that were buying the coffee from Kamwangi Factory in Kenya. Personally I think that the creaminess in the cup stand out, with a lot of acidity reminiscence of pink grape fruit. This year we’re buy both the peaberry and the AA selection of the coffee, this one being the AA meaning the larger bean size.” /Joanna Alm, Head roaster 
 The coffee cherries are hand sorted for unripes and overripes by the farmers before they go in to production. The pulp (cheery) is removed and the coffee is fermented for 24-36 hour under close shade depending on climate temperatures . After fermentation the coffees are washed and again graded by density in washing channels they randomly do soaking in clean water over night in clean water. They are then taken to the drying tables where they will be sun dried 12 to 20 days on African drying beds. Again this time depends on weather conditions. Coffees are covered in plastic during midday and at night to protect the beans from night moisture and rains.

 The Sermon has always been a new take on an old classic. A round body, heavy chocolate notes and berry sweetness are what we consistently strive for. We find coffees that suit this profile and create a blend that focuses on flavor, and highlights coffees from East Africa and South America. Fazenda Aurea a dry-processed Catuai from Brazil, offers a sturdy body and is a great background, while a perfect Guji dry-processed Ethiopia provides an intense berry note. Balancing out these extremes is a coffee from Colombia made up of smallholder farmers' coffees from the northern Cauca region; known for being clean, sweet and full of ripe fruit flavors. All together they yield an espresso that is both exciting and approachable.
 The Sermon excels on a wide variety of espresso machine types (including the old-school, vintage lever machine types). We use a relatively standard approach on our more modern equipment. The Sermon is versatile, so a shorter shot tastes great too. Some folks also like to use the blend on their coffee brewer or press pot for a deep cup.

It can be brewed as filter, but will have increased body, lending itself better to milk. Our other single origins can also be extracted as espresso, however will require higher brew ratios to achieve a balanced extraction.As of May 9th, Bar Nine Espresso is La Plata, Dario Quilindo, Huila, Colombia

 With its shining citric acid profile, florality, and red fruits, this coffee from the Hunkute Cooperative is precisely what you’d hope of Ethiopia’s Sidama region, but with the volume turned all the way up. Comprising two washing stations and 2,000 members, Hunkute is regularly sought by international connoisseurs for its assertive flowers, dense fruit concentration, and mouthwatering briskness. We first encountered this coffee in 2010 at a tasting in Addis Ababa, and by now it’s one of our oldest and most impressive friends.

 Chinook is meant to provide people with a reprieve from the mall experience. It features materials like barn wood, brick and steel to give it a rustic, yet fresh look.
 We presently brew coffees with a Chemex and Able Kone 3. We have two Uber Boilers and use an Uber grinder. We use a 3M Reverse Osmosis system to deliver water around 70PPM.
 Chinook is stacked with espresso equipment; featuring two La Marzocco Mistrals with custom made Strada MP paddles. We use Anfim grinders and also have a Kees van der Westen Mirage Lever machine that we use presently for tastings and demonstrations.
 Our menu is constantly changing with the seasons and mirrors our coffee program.
 Our food philosophy is quite simple. There’s peace of mind in knowing where our food comes from – that the ingredients we use are from small, quality-driven farms, mostly located right here in Alberta. These ingredients are usually only found in high-end restaurants (accompanied by high-end restaurant prices), but we’re committed to using these same artisanal ingredients in a casual café menu. Here are some of the producers we work with: Vital Greens, D Dutchmen Dairy, The Fresh Squeeze, Coco Karamel, Winter’s Turkey, Ewe-Nique Farms, Sylvan Star Cheese, Highwood Crossing, Yum Bakery, Valbella and Sidewalk Citizen.
 Chinook features a variety of baked goods, treats, sandwiches, soups and salads. We bake most of our baked goods ourselves daily in the (very small) Chinook kitchen.
 
Our friendship with Aviv Fried started back in 2008 and we’ve been working with him and his bakery, Sidewalk Citizen, ever since. Over the past year, we decided to work more closely together and offer a wide range of Sidewalk Citizen treats at the cafes.
 Phil & Sebastian love a good party, so bring them and a carrier of freshly brewed coffee with you to the next one – we promise they won’t tell any cheesy jokes.
 Call or visit any of our locations to bring Phil & Sebastian to your next gathering. To learn more about your options visit our catering page.

REGION: Antigua Valley
VARIETAL: Bourbon + Caturra
FARM: Buena Vista Mill
ALTITUDE: 1660 M
FARMER: Luis Pedro Zelaya 
ROAST: Medium 
NOTES: Peaberry
 
Our newest peaberry is packed with sweet and bright flavors of hazelnut and lime along with subtle hints of milk chocolate, dried apricot, raisin and vanilla in aroma and cup. 

    Antigua Valley is perfect for cultivating coffee, with ample rainfall, altitude above 4,900 feet and a constant humidity of 65% -- making Antigua coffee number one in Guatemala.
    
    Luis Pedro Zelaya is a fourth generation coffee farmer working in the heart of the well-known Antigua region. Managing the renowned Beneficio Bella Vista and many other well-known farms in the area, Luis Pedro has produced some truly exceptional coffees over the years. This past year, he built an incredible greenhouse to dry the coffee, which is an improvement over the usual patio setup. 
    
    Peaberry, a type of coffee bean. Normally the fruit (“cherry”) of the coffee plant contains two seeds (“beans”) that develop with flattened facing sides, but sometimes only one of the two seeds is fertilized, and the single seed develops with nothing to flatten it. This oval (or pea-shaped) bean is known as peaberry. Typically around 5% of all coffee beans harvested are of this form.

 This coffee has warm flavors of cinnamon, almond butter and caramel with a long finish and full body.
 Decaf coffee is a whole different animal, so we take extra care in roasting this coffee. The Swiss Water Process is a way of removing the caffeine from coffee without the use of chemicals; we feel that the process helps maintain some of the original flavors of the coffee and gives us more to work with in the roaster. Over the past year, we’ve been focusing on bringing in better tasting decafs by choosing origins we love and using higher quality coffees to put through the decaffeination process. This particular batch turned out super, it comes from the Guji region in the south where many of our tastiest Ethiopian coffees are grown.

 We only use 100% high grade Arabica Beans. Sourced and selected for their seasonal features, these coffees have been carefully roasted to create a choice of quality espresso blends varying in strength, body, acidity, flavour and aroma.
 You have no items in your shopping cart.
 The most common source of fuel used to supply a coffee roaster with heat is gas. We are, however, the first and only roaster in the United States to roast coffee beans exclusively over a fire fueled by Oak Wood. The differences are not what one might initially expect. Unlike cooking with a wood oven or grill, where the smoke from the wood imparts a flavor to the final product, the main difference between wood and conventional roasting lies in the quality of the heat delivered to the beans. Heat derived from wood has higher moisture content and is better suited for slow roasting.
 The more oil preserved within the bean, the more exquisite the final flavor will be. The natural humidity within the wood seems to envelop the beans during the roasting process, hence preserving more of the lipids within. Meanwhile, the slow roasting aspect ensures the coffee is lower in acidity and higher in body. The result is most apparent in our espresso, yielding more crema, fuller flavor, and a smoother finish. For drip coffee for which we actually wish to retain the acidity of the coffees, we subject the beans to a faster roasting time.
 The unique advantages of wood roasting do not come without challenges, as the use of such an inconsistent fuel (i.e. wood) creates difficulties in maintaining consistency between roasts. A nightmare for an inexperienced operator, years of experience of roasting with wood are required to develop the intuition and instinct necessary to master the process. Luckily for us, with 30 years of wood roasting under our belt, we are able to claim this as an advantage; since through the unpredictable nature of roasting with wood, we are required to be attentive and obsessive with each and every roast: nothing can replace the skilled guidance of our experienced roasters. However, never the ones to be overconfident, we still go through extra steps to ensure consistency and quality.
 We begin by selecting well seasoned wood from responsible suppliers. We then utilize thermocouple data collected at key locations on the roaster along with VFD motor control, which allows to make fan and drum speed adjustments during the roasting process. The wood smoke emissions are then abated by high powered afterburners which are in full compliance with local air quality standards. Combining these tools with our years of experience, we are able to maintain control of the roasting process with a very high level of consistency. As you can see, wood roasting is an artisan craft where human experience using old world methods, combined with the latest technological advances in roasting, delicately blend art and science. We hope you will enjoy a distinctive coffee experience which is impossible to duplicate.

 3 bags once a month, or 1 bag every 2 weeks, you choose how much coffee and how often. We'll send out coffees that we think are the best right now. Coffees will ship fresh and are roasted to order. On top of that, all of our coffees are nitrogen flushed and vacuum sealed to ensure that once you receive your coffee, it stays fresh. Simple as that. 
 Rather than paying a large upfront cost - you are billed with each shipment. This allows you to make changes to your subscription as you please!
 Each week, our roasting team will decide what coffee they are most excited about. Sometimes there will be coffees that only our subscribers will get to receive. This is a curated, coffee program that you can increase, or decrease the frequency and/or the quantity of coffee you receive. You can put the subscription on pause if you are going on vacation, or cancel if you need to. You are in complete control, and you'll never be without coffee in the house. 
 Big brother to the Porlex mini, if there were such thing as a luxury hand grinder, this would be it. 
 Like its smaller sibling, the JP-30 has a longer length and a bigger capacity to grind more coffee at once. Really easy to adjust, this guy is pretty speedy for a hand-grinder. Hand grinders do take a little elbow grease, but burr is better! (It will take about three minutes to grind coffee when full.)

 
              When people ask us about better brewing tips, getting the grind right is always at the top of our suggestion list. Read more.

 Because it was conceived just 38.5 miles from our Oakland roastery by Aerobie (those wonderful folks who created an improbably long-flying disc), we'd like to humbly assert that the AeroPress is our first locally-produced piece of merchandise. It’s a peculiar and lovely device – easily the most durable and portable option for brewing quality coffee. It produces a cup that’s thick and focused, but still quite nuanced.

 Bring to a boil enough water for both the AeroPress and your brew vessel. 400 grams ought to do it.
 Insert a paper filter into the AeroPress’s detachable plastic cap.
 Weigh out 15 grams of coffee.
 Grind your coffee. AeroPress calls for a fine grind – just a bit more so than drip coffee.
 Assemble your AeroPress. Make sure the entire assembly is dry, since any residual moisture can compromise the device’s seal.
 Place it on your scale with the flared end up, then tare the weight. The numbers should appear upside-down. It’s possible to attach the black filter cap and place it right side-up, but this tends to cause leakage and make accurate brewing slightly more difficult.
 Add your ground coffee. Be careful not to spill any grounds into the ring-shaped gutter at the top of the AeroPress, as this can make attaching the cap a challenge later on.
 Add twice the weight of water to your amount of grounds. For example, if you’ve got 15 grams of coffee, add 30 grams of water. Your water ought to be about 200 F.
 Gently immerse the grounds with a bamboo paddle or butter knife. The goal here is not to stir them so much as it is to guarantee even saturation. Let this sit for 30 seconds.
 Add another 160 grams of water and let sit for one minute.
 Use the remainder of your water (it should be about 200 grams) to wet your filter and cap. The water will serve a dual function here: It will both help the filter adhere to the cap, and it will heat your brewing vessel.
 After a minute has elapsed, give your grounds 10 vigorous stirs.
 Screw the cap onto the AeroPress. You’re in very close proximity to seriously hot coffee here, so please be careful.
 Flip the whole assembly over with haste and control and purpose. All three. Position it atop your brew vessel and begin applying downward pressure. You ought to experience about 30 pounds of resistance here. If the pushing feels too easy, your grind is likely too coarse; if it’s very hard to push, chances are the grind is a bit too fine. Your coffee’s fully brewed once it begins to make a hissing sound. This means there’s no more water to push through the device.
 Now here’s the really satisfying part, for two reasons. Once you’ve unscrewed the cap, you can pop out the filter and the puck of condensed grounds by simply pushing the AeroPress’s interior section a final inch. Then, of course, you can pour your coffee and enjoy. And please do enjoy.

 This highly anticipated follow up book to his Barista and Filter books touches on almost all aspects of coffee roasting and presents Scott's ideas he has formed from years of practical experience.
 As a roaster and a consultant over the past nineteen years, Scott Rao has had the opportunity to cup and view the roast data for each of more than 20,000 batches roasted on a variety of machines by various methods. About five years ago, he spent several days poring over reams of roast data in an attempt to find the common elements in the best batches I’d ever tasted.* To be clear, I’m not refer-ring to “really good” batches. I focused only on the data from batches so special that I could “taste” them in my memory months or years after physically tasting them. That effort yielded what I think of as the “commandments of roasting.”

 This year was a good one for Ethiopian coffees, and Phil cupped many amazing lots during his trip to Addis Ababa this last January. One coffee stood a notch above rest, and it was this lot from the private washing station owner Mestawet Assefa. Mestawet’s wet processing station is located at an altitude of 1850-1950 meters in the Kochere region of Ethiopia. In and around 650 small-holder farm owners bring their coffee cherry to Mestawet‘s mill to process, which is in the neighbourhood or Kebele of Cheleleketu.
 Coffee from the Cheleleketu neighbourhood is gaining in popularity and the Kebele name is becoming at bit of a brand unto itself. There are many washing stations in the area, and although they have similar profiles, there are important differences between the lots. It’s for this reason also that we put Mestawet’s last name in the title of this lot, to underscore the important distinction that his work brings to the table.
 Although Phil tasted a lot of great coffee in Ethiopia this year, there are two taste artefacts that are dominating the coffees of the Gedeo zone, specifically the yirgacheffe type. The first is an over-ferment or onion taste. This taint occurs if fermentation is pushed a bit too far in an attempt to create a very fruity profile (in a washed coffee). Phil believes that many buyers are so enamoured with the fruit quality that they overlook this taint but the problem is that the onion taste becomes more significant as the coffee ages. The second taint is a background but dominate earthy taste, almost reminiscent of a (minor version of) the Rwanda potato taste. Phil’s not certain what causes this taint but it’s definitely become more prevalent with some big name yirgacheffe-type coffee producers. None of the lots that we bought this year have these two taints but we rejected many coffees because of them!
 One of Phil’s initiatives in Ethiopia this year was to further improve the stability and shelf-life of the coffee we purchased. There are many steps in the processing chain that Ethiopia does very well, but one common misstep (in Phil’s opinion) is the post-dry-milling polishing step. This step, which directly follows the parchment-removing de-hulling step, was traditionally performed for two reasons: 1) to create a smooth, slightly glossy, beautiful appearance of the green bean. 2) to remove the fraction of weight represented by the silver skin. Both these reasons are pretty bad ones, in Phil’s book, especially given that the polishing operation has been linked to premature aging of coffee, due to the removal of the protective antimicrobial layer of cells just under the silver skin (which is abrasively scraped off during polishing). This year Phil requested that the dry mill we work with completely eliminate the polishing step. The results at this point were better retention of cup quality than last year!

 The Sudan Rume type of Arabica coffee has long been used in breeding to improve the cup quality of new hybrids and cultivars, but is rarely grown on its own. Granja La Esperanza of Valle de Cauca, Colombia began growing this type on their Finca Las Margaritas to celebrate the spectacular attributes it can bring to the cup. This honey processed lot is delicate and sweet with floral highlights, notes of sweet strawberry jam and a rounded yet delicate body.

 A sleek and lightweight little powerhouse. The Porlex mini is a favorite around here to pack in our camp coffee kits. 
 We love this grinder on-the-go with easy adjust grind. Hand grinders do take a little elbow grease, but burr is better!  (It will take about two minutes to grind coffee when full.)

 
              Invented by engineer Alan Adler, of Aerobie Frisbee fame, the AeroPress has, fittingly, inspired crazy ingenuity in variety of brew methods. The portable and lightweight AeroPress brews a sweet, full-bodied cup wherever you are: at home, camping or on a road trip. This particular method is best when you’re out in the field or if you don’t have a scale.

 Coava travels the world in pursuit of coffees with the highest quality, complexity, and balance. We take an exhaustive hands-on approach to coffee as an agricultural process. Dedicating ourselves to learning about soil conditions, sustainable farming practices, varietal mutations, and plant diseases are only a few of the areas of specialty that have helped us source outstanding coffees.
 Each year, we spend months at origin courting the most conscientious coffee producers. We use our resources to build better processing facilities, introduce the best preservation practices, and spotlight individual farmers. We also collaborate with coffee mills to buy a farmer’s full harvest. This stands in opposition to the common practice of only purchasing parts of the harvest and leaving the farmer with the harder-to-sell remnants. Our rare approach ensures the purchase of an entire farm’s production at a higher price. We still get the top-tier separations, but we’ve also found a home for the rest of the coffees with the local coffee mill.
 We make these efforts to establish mutually beneficial partnerships with the men and women producing the coffees we adore.
 We are committed to the inherent qualities within each unroasted coffee. We strive to compose beautiful roast profiles that highlight the tremendous work that has been performed by the coffee producers each harvest. We never blend coffees and whenever possible we name them after the farmers who grow them. We are constantly tasting, documenting, and reevaluating our profiles to ensure that we enable individual coffees to shine.
 After everything has been said and done Coava is rooted in preparing exceptional beverages. Our passion for balanced & sweet espresso, perfect milk drinks, and delicious brewed coffee brings our baristas together as craftsmen. We push for consistent excellence by refining our skills through palate calibration, systematic preparation, and self-critique. This dedication has earned our team many first place honors in the Barista Competitions.
 a: given to general and cordial reception of guests
 b: promising or suggesting generous and cordial welcome
 c: offering a pleasant or sustaining environment
 At Coava’s core is the desire to share the delicious coffees that we are excited about. We never dreamed that the pursuit of such a simple goal would surround us with all of the incredible people that make up the Coava family. From our shop’s dedicated regulars to coffee lovers around the globe, we enjoy coffee together. We’ve danced and celebrated, barbequed and tinkered, but also dug in deep and supported one another.
 In similar fashion we would not be who we are without great partnerships. We problem solve harvest and processing issues alongside farmers. We help coffee shops all over the United States open, build up, and expand their businesses. We raise money and resources alongside non-profits to benefit our community. With these amazing partners Coava has been honored to grow, learn, and succeed.

 Fragrant and creamy, this delicate tea is a bloom with fragrant osmanthus flower and chamomile. A gentle morning or afternoon fresh up.
 Ingredients: China white full leaf tea, Chinese osmanthus flower, Egyptian chamomile petals and natural flavors.

 These delicate, shade-dried leaves from China's Fujian Province are naturally high in antioxidants. Egyptian chamomile petals and Chinese osmanthus flowers add a fragrant, toasty, creamy and slightly sweet bloom of flavor.
 White tea has been popular in China for centuries, but only exported since the late 1800s. Bai Mu Dan, or White Peony, is one of two types of white tea produced in China. It comes from the top two leaves and bud of the tea bush, which are shade dried and lightly fired. This gives White Peony a pale cup color and delicate, nutty aroma.

 Why you’ll love it: Generations of Americans have loved Colombian coffees for their balanced and smooth flavors. The San Roque is our interpretation of this classic and popular style, with exceptional sweetness and subtle flavors of citrus, grape, and cherry.
 Story of the bean: Producers in the San Roque Association process and dry their own coffees and deliver them to quality analyst, Duver Rojas, who tastes the coffees delivered every day and pays incentives for the best coffees. Of 100 families in the association, this lot represents only ten producers who embraced these best practices. Their hard work on the steep hillsides unfolding below the San Roque Monastery and above the Magdalena River created this coffee of refined sweetness.

 In blind cuppings, most people can’t even tell that this coffee is decaffeinated, and even pick it as their favorite on the table. Naturally decaffeinated coffee refers to the use of pure water and proprietary carbon filters to remove caffeine from the coffee bean, as opposed to harsh and cheap chemical processes. Naturally decaffeinated coffee tends to have an accentuated body, which is why our staff and customers alike love our Huila.

 Dario Quilindo is a producer in the Huila Dept of Colombia. This is a micro-lot that has seen its second export to the United States in 2016. The coffee was imported through Coffee Shrub and Bar Nine has committed to the entire production of the micro-lot, making it exclusively available through us this year.
 Our roast days are Monday and Wednesday. All coffee is roasted to order and ships one day after the day it was roasted.
 ﻿All of our coffee is now flushed with nitrogen when bagged, creating an inert atmosphere that improves freshness. An unopened bag of coffee can now retain freshness for 4+ weeks.

 Syrupy and intensely sweet, like a raisin, Lucila Bolaños' coffee pairs red fruit with a clementine acidity.
 When they arrived to the farm twelve years ago, they found not coffee trees but rather cattle pastures. Along with her husband, Marco Antonio, Lucila Bolaños began recovering the two opposing hillsides that make up Finca El Porvenir with castillo trees. 
 As we walked the farm with Lucila and her family, her son-in-law, Jose, casually harvested banana, plantain, yucca and avocado from the trees that also call home to "El Porvenir" providing shade and windbreak to the coffee trees, as well as food to the Bolaños family. 
 Lucila Bolaños castillo produce is processed in the typical Colombian small-farmer fashion where it's depulped and soaked in small, plastic fermentation tubs before drying in her on-site parabolic drier.

            With each blend, we hope to achieve that unattainable quality, that little something extra that otherwise cannot be found in a coffee.
            
 Cupping notes : Ample-bodied, Forest floor, Licorice
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Breakfast Blend combines distinctly spicy and mildly pungent characteristics of Indo-Pacific coffees. The result is an eye opening blend that is bold yet well rounded, and profound flavors that are sure to illuminate your mornings.
 Cupping notes : Complex, Dynamic, Blueberry
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Elysian refers to a state of bliss or happiness, simply put – heavenly. The Elysian Blend can be characterized as a very rich, full bodied blend with a lot of depth and complexity in flavor. This makes it a good after dinner coffee to enjoy with dessert.
 Cupping notes : Deep Smokiness, Browned Butter, Caramel
Roast level : DARK
 We choose the coffees for this blend for their ability to be enhanced by a deep, dark roast. This allows for intense flavors such as baker’s chocolate, sweet graham cracker and aromatic, cedar-like wood to accompany rich smokiness in both flavor and aroma. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel and low acidity allow this intensely flavorful coffee to both counter and complement rich desserts or a fresh baked morning pastry.
 Cupping notes : Smooth smoke, Caramelized sugar, Silky body
Roast level : DARK
 This is our darkest Fair Trade/Organic certified blend. We thoughtfully selected the coffees that make up this blend in order to maintain some of their individual aroma and flavor attributes while standing up to the intensity of the unique way that we roast them. The result is a dark roasted coffee with sweetly smoky flavor, light body and just a glimmer of lemony citrus notes; a perfect way to ease into your morning and a great complement to an evening meal.
 Cupping notes : Chocolate, Caramel, Butterscotch
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Whether approaching by sea or from within the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Strait imbues a sense of magic and wonder. The stunning landscapes and picture perfect sunsets inspired us here at Mr. Espresso to create a blend that attempts to capture its grace and majesty. Dark chocolate, sweet caramel and fruit toned acidity seamlessly blend together to create our homage to this wonder of nature.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 There are seven bridges that keep the people of the Bay Area connected, and the Seven Bridges Blend pays homage to the diversity of people and tastes in the San Francisco Bay Area.
 A blend of Fair Trade and organic certified coffees, the Seven Bridges Blend is a velvety bodied blend with depth and a complex, multilayer flavor dynamic. A favorite among customers and chefs alike, this blend can be found at some of the finest dining establishments around the San Francisco Bay Area.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Silky, Subtle fruit tones
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Countless cafés along the Viennese streets have loaned out their tables to some of the finest thinkers of our time and some of the greatest works of art, politics and philosophy found their inspiration accompanied by a rich cup of coffee. Here at Mr. Espresso we took inspiration from this legacy of creativity when we came up with our Viennese Blend. A combination of our finest dark and light roasted Latin American coffees come together to create a rich, smoky cup with low toned fruit notes and a silky mouth feel.
 Cupping notes : Sweet Chocolate, Vanilla, Cherry
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Named after the restaurant that Carlo’s brother Franco Di Ruocco owned, Ristorante Villanova (Oakland circa 1980) – and the house blend that was served there. Its mild intensity embodies the essential characteristics of a classic American roast, yet reflects our passion for traditional, wood fired roasting. The Villanova House Blend is sweet enough to serve as a dessert coffee and mild enough to enjoy throughout the day.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Smoky, Low-toned acidity
Roast level : DARK
 The choice to use water processed decaf coffees for our Decaffeinated French Roast was necessitated by our desire to deliver our customers a delicious dark roast without caffeine or compromise. A silky mouthfeel and low-toned acidity enables the rich smoky flavor to linger without interruption through the long, resonant finish.
 Cupping notes : Smooth, Well balanced, Medium body
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 This is a blend of water processed decaffeinated Latin American coffees combining to make a smooth, full flavored coffee with medium body and well balanced acidity.
 Cupping notes : Caramelized sugar, Fruit notes, Silky mouth feel
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 This is a blend of African and Indonesian beans decaffeinated by a water process developed in Switzerland, which is considered the most natural method of decaffeinating coffee. Decaffeinated Elysian Blend is a hearty and full flavored blend, which is most unusual of water processed coffees.
 Cupping notes : Velvety body, Complex sugars, Sweet acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Modeled after our Organic Seven Bridges Blend, this coffee has all the positive characteristics of the Organic Seven Bridges Blend without the caffeine. A good alternative for after dinner enjoyment or simply for those who are caffeine sensitive. The coffee is 99.9% caffeine free.

 To honor our long standing relationship with the Kochere Cooperative we are highlighting a dozen of their top scoring producers. These stalwarts have proven themselves through consistently delivering only the ripest of cherries. After processing and a period of rest we have the green coffee sorted for defects an additional two times longer than other lots coming out of Kochere. This Coava exclusive is named for the beautiful “blossoms” found on coffee trees before harvest.
 Black tea, honey comb, and sweet rose blossom mark the Meaza among the most delicious Ethiopian coffees we have ever tasted.

 The Chemex is undergoing a renaissance thanks to its elegant design and sweet and balanced cup character. This kit will get you up to speed with all the essentials to brew one of our favorite methods.
 The Chemist contains every piece of equipment you need to get from beans to brew. With the Encore grinder and the Gooseneck Kettle, you’re well on your way to pour over pro.

 
              An iconic brewer with a timeless design invented in 1941, the Chemex is easy to use and easy on the eyes. The Chemex is housed in the MOMA permanent design collection —it also lives on most of our kitchen counters, too. It  brews a clean cup and maintains body and balanced floral notes.

            
 Throughout the years of civil war and unrest in Nicaragua, Don Anibal kept growing low‐risk vegetables like bell pepper, onions, and cabbage on his valley farm. He was moderately successful,but his dreams were up in the clouds. When peace finally came to the Nubarrones, that’s exactly where he went: the highlands of Nubarrones (“thunderclouds”).
 Up in the Nubarrones, he bought a modest 37 acres‐‐that’s about two Dolores Parks, for you locals. Unlike Dolores Park, this farm lacked roads. There are probably a lot of other things at Dolores Park that Anibal’s new farm lacked, but a way to and from the moutainside farm… well, that was a bit of a hurdle.
 Don Anibal spent more of his vegetable farm profits on a few mules to ferry supplies up and down until he finished the road. He expanded the farm in all directions. All the while, Anibal’s long‐held dream continued to glow in the back of his mind: the chance to start a coffee farm, up among the clouds.
 This is the Maragogype separation from Anibal’s farm‐‐his Caturra is among our usual offerings. The first time we visited Anibal’s farm, we hiked straight uphill, from the base of his farm to the Honduras‐bordering peak. Up at the top, a south‐facing expanse of beautiful Maragogype came into view, like a mirage. Since that day, Anibal started sending us separated samples of this lot, and now here we are, with an outstanding SMALL lot.

 Strawberry Tart / Toblerone / Shirley Temple
 Within the well respected micro region of Pedegral lies a small village, Agua Blanca. Cousins Walter and Juvenal Penna are the shining producers of this “jewel in the crown” that is Agua Blanca. In the highest elevations of Agua Blanca both producers operate their own farms and washing stations maintaining the same standards as the other. Beyond their exceptional practices, one of the other secrets to their quality is the combined varietal makeup. Walter produces Typica and Yellow Bourbon while Juvenal grows exclusively Caturra – a combination rarely seen in Colombia. This is the second year we have worked with Walter & Juvenal and are proud to be able to offer their coffees once again. Never have we experienced a coffee carry such a similar flavor profile over two years. The cousin’s skilled farming practices and processing techniques come together to make a consistently amazing coffee that we love both brewed and served as a single origin espresso.
 Agua Blanca starts off with sweet fruit tones of ripe strawberry, orange and peach and an underlying menthol-like herbaliness that reminds us of wild wintergreen. Cooling, the cup richens into flavors of milk chocolate and toffee, similar to Toblerone bars. This coffee, just like last year, is full of candied fruit tones such as preserved cherries and orange, which combined with the sweeter wine finish, reminds us of the Minnesota classic - the brandy old fashion. It is the perfect coffee to toast the hard work and continued excellence of those around you.

 Sebastian and Phil first visited Finca Santa Clara in 2011, and were immediately impressed by the farm and the farmer. Welcoming and open-minded, Ricardo possesses a unique blend of business acumen and agricultural knowledge. He is willing to experiment with new techniques in order to find new ways to improve quality moving forward. Over the last three years, Sebastian has worked very closely with Ricardo to examine his processes for picking, drying, and processing.
 Ricardo recognizes the importance of skilfully harvesting ripe cherry in quality lots. In the past, he has sent more experienced pickers to his best bourbon lots before the rest continue the harvest; these individuals are typically paid higher wages and are selected based on performance. Even with this method, there were still some inconsistencies in the level of quality achieved. Sebastian suggested a change in the process to have the foreman inspect each lot and approve daily pickings with a ticketing system. After implementing this process, we’ve seen a dramatic difference in this area and greatly appreciate Ricardo’s willingness and open-mindedness.
 Drying was the next area of focus, as Sebastian and Ricardo monitored temperature and humidity on the drying patio over the course of two weeks. Using data loggers, they discovered temperatures on the patio exceeding 45°C, a potentially damaging factor to a coffee’s longevity and stability.
 Thankfully, last year, Ricardo built a new greenhouse dryer with raised drying beds. The greenhouse is designed to increase airflow to the beds while maintaining a more consistent temperature. The average temperature during drying now drastically lower than the temperatures achieved in the concrete patios. This slower and more consistent drying has resulted in coffee with remarkable longevity.
 Santa Clara is an example of how a large farm can focus and still produce a very high quality product. Ricardo’s farm produces over eight containers of coffee, so he has implemented processes that result in consistent quality for the majority of his coffees. These are Caturra, Valencia and Bourboncito, all planted in the lower sections of the farm at around 1500-1600m. The coffee that we buy is from the “cazco” (helmet in Spanish) where the variety is mostly Bourbon and the elevations range from 1700m-1900m. This is the coffee that Ricardo doesn’t mess around with, starting with the stricter cherry selection, precise fermentation process and lower temperature drying in the ventilated greenhouse. We had this coffee decaffeinated by our good friends at Swiss Water in Burnaby BC.

                            The coffee is hand picked by the farmers and their families. After delivering the coffee to the wet mill the good coffee cherries are separated from the inferior ones. The cherries are depulped and graded by using an old disc de-pulper that uses water and gravity to sort dense beans from less dense beans. The beans are dry fermented for about 12-16 hours over night in one tank, then transported to a second tank with water where the fermentation is continued for up to another 30 hours depending on the climate and amount of mucilage left. After fermentation the coffee is washed and graded in the evening before it gets  dried on african elevated drying tables, where defect parchment coffee gets sorted out. The coffee is dried to a moisture between 10-12% and stored in conditioning bins before delivery to the dry mill.                      
 We wish to preserve and enhance as much of the natural coffee flavours as possible so that you will be able to taste the distinct flavours that is unique to each coffee we import. 
Therefore we roast our coffees very carefully in order not to cover our coffees with roasty aromas from darker roasts and at the same time stay away from the grassy flavors and sour acidity from a underdeveloped roast.

Our light roasted coffees are suited for all brew methods except espresso. The roast level gives a cup with clarity, brightness and sweetness with little  bitterness and ashy flavors from the roast process.

If brewed as espresso on an espresso machine, the lighter roast style will result in a cup with a very high level of acidity due to the highly concentrated brew. We therefore recommend using our slightly darker roasted coffees for making espresso.
 All our coffees are packed in vacuum sealed, recyclable plastic bags that are flushed with nitrogen before seal- ing. The bags has a one way valve to let the coffee de-gas while quality is kept in the sealed bag.

When the coffee is roasted it develops a lot of CO2 gas inside the beans. This gas will make the coffee taste smokey and ashy immediately after roasting. It is abso- lutely crucial to let the coffee degas and rest for a while before use to ensure maximum flavour.

We recommend storing / degassing our ligher roasted coffees for minimum 3 to 5 days after the date of roast , sealed in the original bag at room temperature, before you use it.

Make sure you store it in a dark place at around 14°C - 20°C, away from any heat, moisture or light. The coffee has lost most of its sweetness and aroma 3-4 weeks after the day of roast, so make sure you use it before it is too late.

You can find the roast date and batch number on all our coffees in the bottom right corner of the front label on the bags. 
 We strongly recommend to use correct measurments and brewing techniques when you brew our coffees. Use a digital scale both to measure water and coffee in order to get consistent results.

We recommend to use between 60 to 70 grams of coffee per litre (1000g) of water, depending on the brewing method, water quality and coffee used.

 Kilenso Mokonissa is one of the smallest villages in the Borena Hagermariam District of Sidama. In the past the coffees coming from Kilenso would have been blended into larger lots and sold under the area’s catch all name “Ardi.” The farmers there use organic practices (though they are too poor to pay for the certification) so as to not waste anything they produce.
 Lavender and grape jam balance this naturally processed coffee. It is a testament to the diligent care put forth by a very small group of people

                            The coffee is selectively hand picked by hired pickers under
supervision of Elias. Cherries are hand sorted before they are
processed to make sure only ripe cherries are processed together.
After depulping the parchment coffee is rinsed in clean water.
Then the water is drained and the parchment is fermented for
14 to 16 hours. After fermentation the coffee is washed in clean
water that is changed 4 times. All ﬂoaters are removed during
the washing. The Parchment is soaked for 24 hours in clean
water before it is dried in parabolic dryers under shade from 25 - 35 days.

 The most common source of fuel used to supply a coffee roaster with heat is gas. We are, however, the first and only roaster in the United States to roast coffee beans exclusively over a fire fueled by Oak Wood. The differences are not what one might initially expect. Unlike cooking with a wood oven or grill, where the smoke from the wood imparts a flavor to the final product, the main difference between wood and conventional roasting lies in the quality of the heat delivered to the beans. Heat derived from wood has higher moisture content and is better suited for slow roasting.
 The more oil preserved within the bean, the more exquisite the final flavor will be. The natural humidity within the wood seems to envelop the beans during the roasting process, hence preserving more of the lipids within. Meanwhile, the slow roasting aspect ensures the coffee is lower in acidity and higher in body. The result is most apparent in our espresso, yielding more crema, fuller flavor, and a smoother finish. For drip coffee for which we actually wish to retain the acidity of the coffees, we subject the beans to a faster roasting time.
 The unique advantages of wood roasting do not come without challenges, as the use of such an inconsistent fuel (i.e. wood) creates difficulties in maintaining consistency between roasts. A nightmare for an inexperienced operator, years of experience of roasting with wood are required to develop the intuition and instinct necessary to master the process. Luckily for us, with 30 years of wood roasting under our belt, we are able to claim this as an advantage; since through the unpredictable nature of roasting with wood, we are required to be attentive and obsessive with each and every roast: nothing can replace the skilled guidance of our experienced roasters. However, never the ones to be overconfident, we still go through extra steps to ensure consistency and quality.
 We begin by selecting well seasoned wood from responsible suppliers. We then utilize thermocouple data collected at key locations on the roaster along with VFD motor control, which allows to make fan and drum speed adjustments during the roasting process. The wood smoke emissions are then abated by high powered afterburners which are in full compliance with local air quality standards. Combining these tools with our years of experience, we are able to maintain control of the roasting process with a very high level of consistency. As you can see, wood roasting is an artisan craft where human experience using old world methods, combined with the latest technological advances in roasting, delicately blend art and science. We hope you will enjoy a distinctive coffee experience which is impossible to duplicate.

 Eight years ago, we couldn’t have offered this coffee. It was hard enough for us to explain to people that a few particular Colombian coffees were more exciting than all the assorted grocery store coffee they had seen labeled “Colombian” for decades.
 While we were busy telling our parents why our expensive and floral and syrupy sweet Andino was really worth the effort, the farmers of Bruselas were doing their part as well. First the Andino co-op tightened up their tasting and testing, then they started sending us samples of their neighbors’ most exceptional coffees. What we’re saying is, things have really picked up over the last few years, on both the coffee production side and the coffee-drinking side.
 And now, here we are: 2016, and it’s the third year we’ve offered a sub-lot of Andino featuring the half-dozen coffees that jumped out to us. As usual, we’re paying these producers a quality-based bonus for these coffees beyond the premium prices fetched by the Andino co-op.
 Just like we told people in 2008, this coffee isn’t for everyone. It’s exceedingly tropical, held together with dense syrup and surprising complexity. In fact, there are some hungover mornings when we prefer the straightforward butterscotch flavor of the full Andino co-op to this wild coffee. But if you’re the kind of person who appreciates something rare and special, you really have to give this coffee a try. (And then another. And another….)

 Uraga returns to our offerings list this season as one of a handful of stellar cooperative coffees we are showcasing from Ethiopia. Uraga is quite possibly the finest example of the best coffee Ethiopia's southern Guji Zone has to offer. The extremely high altitude and semi-forested landscape of Guji contribute to this unique flavor profile. This cup is stunning from start to finish: flavors of watermelon and milk chocolate cool to expose refined notes of tea rose and stone fruit.
 Fresh coffee is roasted on Sundays and Wednesdays and shipped the following day. Please place your order by 8:00 PM Eastern Time the evening before the respective roast day to ensure that it is included.

Our Belle is our highest rated espresso blend with a 94 points by coffee expert Kenneth Davids of Coffee Review. Ken tried 40 espressos and rated over 30 espresso blends, placing Belle on top.
    

    Davids described the espresso by Klatch Coffee as: "Intense aroma: brandy, chocolate, caramel. In the small cup medium in body but smooth in mouthfeel, crisply pungent yet caramelly sweet, with a tightly knit, understated complexity: brandy, caramel, cedar and flowers, hints of which persist in the roundly rich finish. Masters milk with a gentle, brandied chocolate authority."

 Flying Monkey espresso was conjured out of experimentation and curiosity. When you have numerous exceptional coffees at your fingertips, you cannot help but play with the possibilities.

From cappuccinos to mochas, Flying Monkey is sure to please.
 We roast our espressos on Mondays and Tuesdays and we highly recommend that you let your espresso rest for 7 days before brewing.

 Extremely balanced, yet playful. Featuring notes of smooth chocolate, honey, and graham cracker, this three bean blend creates a beautiful harmony of flavors while still having enough depth to show off in long milk drinks.

            The potential of Bolivian coffees intrigued us and we’ve been traveling to source unique offerings from the country’s diligent producers since 2011. But after our trips, we knew there was room for improvement. Currently we’re involved in projects with producers from the remote communities of Villa Imperial and San Luis in the Taipiplaya region as well as communities in the Loa region to improve their methods. We’ve also developed a strong relationship with the Buena Vista mill near the city of Caranavi, strengthening our ties to the community.
        
 We started our work in Bolivia in 2011 with ASOCAFE, a mill and cooperative near the remote coffee communities of Villa Imperial and San Luis. Being so high up in the mountains, these communities don’t process their own coffee and instead opt to bring it down to the nearby ASOCAFE. We saw a lot of potential in these incredible coffees grown at high elevations and have worked with the producers to improve their methods through giving feedback on picking techniques, and better prices for quality. We’ve also done extensive work over the past several years with ASOCAFE to improve their processing methods, particularly when it comes to drying. By financing and building raised drying beds and shading structures, we were able to help them to dry coffees slowly and evenly. We’ve also bought GrainPro bags to store the coffee once it is dried, helping to protect it from humidity in the warehouse and during its treacherous journey to the mill in the Bolivian capital of La Paz.
 In 2013, we started working with another Bolivian coffee mill called Buena Vista in Caranavi. This mill is quite sophisticated and we are excited about the opportunities to experiment and build larger lots of coffee from Bolivia – most farmers in Bolivia produce very small amounts of coffee. From our relationship with Buena Vista, we discovered a couple great producers who we’re keen to continue to build relationships with: Juan Coquira and Celia Condori.
 Coffee from Bolivia has the potential to be truly incredible, and each year we work more with the Bolivian people, we’re seeing more of this potential realized. Sebastian travels there frequently, working closely with the communities and the mills to monitor and improve, as well as fostering new found friendships with the producers and their families.

 Easily the best Sumatran coffee we’ve tasted all year. It will change the way you think about Indonesian coffee.
 Unmistakable Indonesian earthiness but with distinct clarity and dried fruit sweetness. If you like a big-bodied cup, this one’s for you.

 Ibu Rahmah is the Chairwoman for Ketiara which prides itself upon remaining a female led cooperative that redefines what Indonesian coffee can be – it produces some of the cleanest, sweetest Indonesian coffee around.
 This lot comes from the Bies Penantan community. In addition to coffee, the group grows avocado, orange, banana, pepper, ginger and more under a lush, old-growth forest.
 For all types of filter coffee brewing, we recommend the following parameters:
 A confirmation with instructions will be emailed to you.
 Created as an organic counterpart to our House Blend, El Gallo has a round mouthfeel with a smooth, candied sweetness. Flavors of citrus and stone fruits meet hints of creamy nougat and caramel, making a thoroughly enjoyable first cup of the day.

 This coffee meets or exceeds Intelligentsia's Direct Trade standards. For a coffee to be given this status, Intelligentsia and the producer/cooperative partner must meet ALL of the following criteria.

 This lot actually combines three farms, all owned by members of the Lovo family. Each farm’s lot was washed in a separate beneficio, then immediately delivered to the La Estrella mill for drying on African‐style raised and shaded beds.
 First, there’s dad: Don Joaquin Augusto Lovo Lopez. He’s sort of the neighborhood’s go‐to elder for specialty coffee. He made sure that his sons were educated, but kept them working on the family farm evenings and weekends.
 Among the sons: David Ariel Lovo Gutierrez. David Ariel bought Finca La Pradera back in 1969, and‐‐except for the conflicts of the 1980s‐‐hasn’t left it since.
 Finally, his brother: Don Luis Joaquin Lovo. He’s basically the spokesman for the family, or at least the guy who sells us the coffee. Don Luis is actually a pretty quiet guy for a spokesman, come to think of it. What he is, is driven. He’s the one who pesters the Estrella mill‐workers and his export partners, frequently checking in on the coffee’s quality, always seeking feedback.
 It was a desire for feedback as much as anything that motivated Don Luis to hold back a few bags of his Maragogype crop for the Nicaraguan Cup of Excellence. What he got was an award. We’ll have a little of that for you this summer. But for now, step into this Caturra lot from the whole Lovo family.
 
            Colombia is a very well known and celebrated coffee producing country known for its range of flavour, sweetness and acidity. Coffee is an important part of its history, with many of the coffee growing regions in the country listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites. We’ve been sourcing coffee from Colombia since 2010 and have focused on building relationships with producers in the Huila region, one of the most notable for quality. This has led to some great relationships, like with our long-time friends the Guzman Brothers.
        
 Coffee in Colombia, though very exciting, can be quite a challenge as many farms in the country value yield over quality processing. This can traced back to federally funded programs aimed at increasing production. These programs are beneficial for many producers but aren’t always the best strategy for inciting quality coffee producers. The programs often focus on fast and hot drying systems, which are quite damaging to quality coffees and negatively affects their shelf life. What gets us going when it comes to Colombian coffees are the relationships that we’ve been able to develop with producers who are truly interested in improving quality and are passionate about their product. Kindred spirits, if you will. This is what we’ve found in the Guzman  Brothers.
 Audenar, Alirio and Abelardo Guzman have been our partners and friends since 2010, and have implemented projects to improve picking coffee cherry, processing, drying and storage. We’ve helped them design and build raised drying structures that optimize conditions by shading the coffee and improving the air-flow. Each brother monitors the drying coffee five times a day in order to achieve the ideal moistures and water activity. To protect their coffee from high humidity and temperatures, they store everything in GrainPro at their farm until they can make a delivery. This diligent work has led to some outstanding results and provided us with our best Colombian coffees for the past two years. In order to show our appreciation, we enthusiastically agreed to a three-year contract, committing us to buy all the quality coffee they produce.
 We’re also in the process of seeking out more producers who are interested in working with us to improve the quality of their coffee. A challenge, yes, but we’ve been inspired by what we accomplished with the Guzmans and hope to repeat the success story.

            In addition to our Italian style blends, feel free to experiment with our Single Origins and Blends to make a distinct espresso with an additional layer of verve and intrigue. 
            
 Cupping notes : Sweet Chocolate, Sweet Caramel, Fruit toned acidity
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Originally created as the companion to our Golden Gate House Blend, this espresso has a sweet chocolate flavor complimented by notes of fruit and caramel along with a well balanced acidity. It is a harmonious blend of Fair Trade and Organic certified coffees.
 Cupping notes : Bittersweet chocolate, Hazelnut, Caramel candy
Roast level : MEDIUM-DARK
 Surrounded by the sights and smells of the region during his youth, Mr. Espresso’s founder, Carlo Di Ruocco, set out to master the art and science behind coffee roasting and blending of classic espressos true to the region. We believe he did just that, and today Mr. Espresso is proud to offer Carlo’s interpretation of a timeless classic. True to its roots, Neapolitan Espresso is sure to delight the senses whether it is prepared at home with a stove-top “Caffettiera Napoletana” or expertly crafted at your neighborhood espresso bar.
 Cupping notes : Rich chocolate, Praline, Toffee
Roast level : MEDIUM
 Our goal with Organic Neapolitan was to create an espresso blend that contained similar attributes as our conventional Neapolitan using only coffees that are Fair Trade certified and grown without the use of agrichemicals. Complex, intense and rich in both flavor and aroma, Organic Neapolitan Espresso is the perfect balance of taste and social responsibility.
 Cupping notes : Meyer lemon, Brazil nut, Cocoa finish
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 “Triestino” Espresso refers to Trieste, Italy – which is the capital city of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region in Northeast Italy. The Port of Trieste is Italy’s and one of Europe’s great coffee ports, supplying more than 40% of Italy’s coffee.   Lighter bodied than our more traditional espresso blends with a smooth body and creamy mouthfeel; the rich nut-toned cocoa flavors of this blend are accented by lively fruit notes.  The flavor profile of the Espresso Triestino is inspired by the style of espresso which is normally consumed in this region.
 Cupping notes : Rich chocolate flavor, Stunning aromatics and Sweet resonant finish.
Roast level : MEDIUM
 “Tuscan Espresso” refers to the region of Tuscany, Italy – which is known for its role as the birthplace of the Renaissance, simple yet wonderful cuisine, and a wine producing region to which the Napa Valley is often compared to for both quality and beauty.  The flavor profile of our Tuscan Espresso is inspired by the style of espresso which is normally consumed in this region.
 Cupping notes : Rich, Licorice, Caramel
Roast level : MEDIUM
 If you are anything like us, the urge for an espresso can hit you at just about anytime day or night. With this in mind, we searched out and found the decaffeinated coffee dreams are made of (or at least allows for the sleep to dream). The rich golden crema, syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of licorice and caramel might just change your mind about how good a decaf can be. This is the perfect blend to pair with a dessert, or as one. Feel the freedom to indulge.
 Cupping notes : Cocoa-caramel, Fruit-tones, bold body
Roast level : MEDIUM
 The challenge in creating a blend that reflects the ideal characteristics of a truly delicious espresso is too often compounded by the availability and quality of the decaffeinated coffees on the market. Organic Decaffeinated Espresso is a challenge met. Thick, golden crema and cocoa-caramel aromatics that follow into the cup with distinct, yet subtle fruit notes. Perfectly balanced in milk drinks and alive with flavor as a straight shot.
 These are current, fresh crop filter coffees. This means in the summer to early winter, you’ll see lots from Central America and East Africa. In the winter through the spring, southern hemisphere will take over.

 This past February, we made our yearly trip to Ethiopia with Aleco Chigounis of Red Fox Coffee Merchants. These annual visits are always exciting, as Ethiopia is our favorite coffee producing country, and the coffees grown there are always dynamic and delicious. Among many of the cupping destinations on the trip, one of the best was the Oromia Cooperative Union, about an hour outside of base in Addis. Here, we cupped some of the most vibrant coffees the country had to offer, and found many additions to our upcoming lineup.

    Over the last decades, quality coffee production in Rwanda has advanced substantially. Since being decimated by civil war and strife, coffee has become a major export in Rwanda, where more than three-quarters of its citizens subsist through agriculture. Investment in infrastructure to process coffee and close work with growers has increased production of specialty coffee, work aided by non-profit and government funded programs, some of which was advised by professionals in specialty coffee. Kanzu the Cooperative  has had the support of Technoserve, an organization that was also involved in Mutovu and Yukro. It certainly helps that Rwanda’s terrain is very mountainous, with the high elevations, healthy ecosystems and nutrient rich soil beneficial to quality production.
 
    The Kanzu name refers both to the cooperative and the washing station. Kanzu rests in a valley betwixt mountain peaks near the shores of Lake Kivu. Founded in 2006 with the aid of Technoserve, Kanzu brings together the coffee from hundreds of farmers who harvest fruit from trees cultivated on the mountains above and deliver ripe cherry for processing. Old-growth bourbon trees and terroir of the Nyamasheke region provide the backbone for this coffee with powerful character and acidity, while a 24 hour fermentation process adds complexity. After harvest and drying in March-July, this coffee then faces an epically long journey from land-locked Rwanda here to the USA.
 
    Lush, deeply fruited, and juicy, Kanzu is vivid, clear and clean. This marks our third consecutive season purchasing coffee from the Nyamasheke region. This dynamic coffee represents the potential for high-quality in Rwanda, and elsewhere in Africa where excellent terroir can be at odds with challenges in infrastructure and government which make uncovering coffees like Kanzu difficult. We’re very excited to offer this coffee for Winter and Spring.

 By luck and chance we were offered this stellar micro lot from the Consaca Cooperative in Narino Colombia. Colombia is an country we know very well and have built some of our strongest producer Direct Trade partnerships with. This however is our first ever from the area of Narino in the far southwest of Colombia. We have visited Narino once before while on the Jury of for the Cup of Excellence held in Pasto, Narino. While there we met the producer group of Consaca. Randomly 4 years later we receive a sample from a close Exporter partner in Colombia from Consaca, and surprise it delicious. The rest they say is history...Or maybe the future...

REGION: Kivu, Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo
VARIETAL: Bourbon
FARM: Kahawa Latumba
ALTITUDE: 1460 - 2000 M
FARMER: AMKA Cooperative
ROAST: Medium
NOTE: Washed process

 
This bean features a dynamic flavor profile from start to finish. It starts with a sweet chocolate and cinnamon spice in aroma. Then, bright hints of lemon, grapes, honey and orange become are defined in the cup. Along with a tart-berry acidity and velvety body, this coffee will give you something to smile about to start the new year! 
    
    Kahawa Latumba washing station was built just before the 2014 coffee season In
their inaugural season, the AMKA Cooperative, led by Kabugoyi Andre, produced 
50,000 kgs green coffee. In 2015 they produced 60,000 kgs of green coffee.
    
    The climatic and geographical conditions of the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo are ideal to grow high quality coffee. However, infrastructure and trade have been in decline since the country gained its independence from Belgium in the 1960’s and were nearly destroyed in the years following the Rwandan genocide in 1994.  Ongoing conflicts and violence caused many farmers to flee, abandoning their homes and coffee plantations. Producers who had nowhere else to go were forced to smuggle their coffee harvest out of the country to make a living.  Although the situation is still unstable, many farmers are looking for means to rebuild their lives again through agriculture. Fair Trade coffee, which has already proven a powerful conflict resolution tool in other unstable regions, has the potential to provide farmers and communities with sustainable livelihoods.
    
    Situated on the shores of Lake Kivu, SOPACDI (Solidarité Paysanne pour la Promotion des Actions Café et Développement Intégral) is one of few Congolese coffee cooperatives working with farmers affected by the region’s constant struggles. With support from different organizations such as Twin Trading, SOPACDI has built its capacity to produce and export coffee to the highest of international standards. Due to the dire situation of coffee farmers in East Congo, Fair Trade officials took the initiative to allow SOPACDI to trade on Fair Trade terms on the basis of a documentary inspection, as the smoldering conflict in the region prevented FLO-CERT inspectors from traveling into the country. The cooperative became the first Fair Trade certified entity in Congo, with over 3,200 members of which an estimated 600 are women.

 Why You’ll Love It: This balanced coffee has a toasted coconut sweetness that stands out among other Brazilians.Story of The Bean: This coffee is called the Mahogany lot because it grows on the Fazenda Matilde farm under a canopy of beautiful Mahogany trees. The coffee and Mahogany are inter-cropped to provide shade for the coffee, bird habitats and erosion control. The trees are also a source of income for the farm, as Mahogany trees can be sold for wood after 20 years of growth. Our roaster visited the hillsides on this farm where this coffee is hand-picked, a rarity in Brazilian production. During tastings on the farm, he hand-selected this lot and we are excited to carry this unique Brazilian coffee for years to come.

 Kilenso Mokonissa is one of the smallest villages in the Borena Hagermariam District of Sidama. In the past the coffees coming from Kilenso would have been blended into larger lots and sold under the area’s catch all name “Ardi.” The farmers there use organic practices (though they are too poor to pay for the certification) so as to not waste anything they produce.
 Lavender and grape jam balance this naturally processed coffee. It is a testament to the diligent care put forth by a very small group of people

 San Jose Poaquil (just outside Chimaltenango and a 2 hour drive from Antigua) is grown and collected at an altitude of 1500 - 2000 m.a.s.l. by various families of small producers. The team at Beneficio Bella Vista work with the cherry; separating day lots to be ready for us to visit, cup and blend.
 The vision behind this cherry collection project is eventually to have these small holder farmers processing and drying their own production. With altitudes soaring to 2000 meters, the potential here seems endless. This new 2016 crop of Poaquil is sweet and vibrant with creamy texture, and soft spring flavours of rhubarb and apricot.

 The 1950 Blend's flavor profile harkens back to the days of old when spice traders collided with new lands and coffee shipped on boats made of timbers, flying canvas sails. In the cup, floral jasmine, lemongrass and a dense sweetness emerge balanced with a complex and spiced, weighty body. Applying a bit more roast on the blend than we generally approach our single origin coffees with, this blend will stand up to milk with the best of them and makes an exotic shot of espresso.
 Creating a blend to achieve a particular flavor profile can be very exciting. It allows us to cup samples from all over, with the goal of finding the perfect coffee, or coffees, to suit our needs. In doing so for The 1950 Blend, we seek heirloom, varietal coffees from the birthplace of coffee: Ethiopia. These coffees are some of the most nuanced, and complex coffees on the planet and can shape-shift from region to region, processing, and through roast application.

 Why You'll Love It: This refined Colombian coffee displays rarely-tasted flavors of hibiscus and caramel-dipped apples.Story of The Bean: This coffee is the pride of Asociacion de Productores Agricolas de San Roque, a group of coffee producers that has set up an education system with a trained agronomist. Farmers receive classes on best growing practices, including planting the native Chachafruta tree which, in addition to having beautiful flowers, also fixes nitrogen in the soil and reduces the need for fertilizers. The Asociacion also works with a quality control analyst who tastes every delivery of coffee and grades it, then pays out price incentives for higher quality beans. Grown on steep hills in nutrient-rich volcanic soil, this extremely limited lot represents only the very best-tasting coffees from the San Roque producers.

        Coffee is about pleasure. It’s that moment when your hand is warmed by the mug, you bring it up to your nose, inhale deeply and then take a sip.
      
 
        That sip is the culmination of years of work, three-thousand mile journeys, and passion. Here is how we make that sip perfect.
      
 
        While you are holding that cup of coffee, close your eyes. Open your mouth slightly. Breathe in deeply through your nose.
      
 
        You are smelling the most complex thing humans consume. When people talk about the flavors of coffee — notes of orange, or hints of clove — it’s because those organic molecules are contained in the coffee bean. If a coffee reminds you of apple pie, it's because coffee shares some of the same components as food, like lactic and malic acid.
      
 
        Inside that small bean are the same natural components that make flowers smell so lovely, the same ethers that let you know when a piece of fruit is ripe. Coffee has twice as much going on, molecularly speaking, as red wine.
      
 
        When tasting coffee, try waiting for it to cool down a little — you’ll be able to taste (and smell) the most when it’s the same temperature as your body.
      
 
        Flavor only matters in the context of you. What do you like? What does this scent remind you of? Are you looking for a full-bodied cowboy co
        ffee, or a delicate, tea-like finish? Chocolate aromas, or hints of jasmine?
 
        Don’t worry if you can’t describe it precisely, or have a different perception than someone else. Even when you can’t put it into words, you’ll know what you like.
      
 
        You experience the full flavors of the coffee bean if and only if nothing has gone wrong during…
      
 
        There is one right way to roast coffee.
      
 
        Someone stands by that roaster, all day, a person who knows exactly how to bring the best out of every bean — that ideal ratio of sweetness to acidity, that balance — because he or she has been doing this for years.
      
 
        Again and again, they repeat the same motion: pull a tiny sample of the beans. Stare at them, looking for the tiny signs of perfection. Smell them deeply. Put them back. Pull out some more beans. Stare. Smell. Five seconds later, repeat the process in a meditation that last hours. Do that hundreds of times a day. Do that every day for years.
      
 
        Know every bean on a personal level. Adjust times and temperatures throughout the day, knowing that 15 seconds could make the difference between letting this bean shine and overwhelming it. Know that in the morning, the roaster is cold. Know that in the evening it’s hot, and you should probably shave 45 seconds off that roast.
      
 
        Roast just enough to bring out the best and full potential of what’s inherent in each particular coffee already. Roast to draw out things like acidity, floral notes, chocolate, molasses, and earth. All of the coffee’s flavor potentials are presented at the first crack – an audible signal that happens at a particular point when roasting coffee. After that, roast just enough to add the right amount of body and sweetness, without degradation.
      
 
        Roasting different coffees as though they’re the same? Not going to work. Roasting for color, not taste? Never this.
      
 
        Please don’t burn those beans. They’ve been through so much. They’ve come all the way across the world.
      
 
        The best coffee grows in the most remote places. There is a thin band that goes around the world near the equator. Within that band, you need mountains, thick old-growth forest and just the right microclimate. Set aside up to four days to get there.
      
 
        On your way there, you’ll pass through Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport, or you’ll stand in the endless security line at New York’s JFK en route to distant parts of Ethiopia, Colombia, Indonesia and 10 other countries around the world.
      
 
        You’ll also experience 8 vaccines (the malaria pills—which can cause hallucinations and nightmares—are the worst), a passport that fills up with handwritten visas, bumpy eight-hour van rides, granola bars and in at least one case, eating the heart of a bull that has been slaughtered in your honor.
      
 
        The Green Team members, named for the color of coffee beans before they are roasted, don’t do it the easy way, which would be buying bulk, mid-quality beans at a trading floor in a capital city. Instead, they go right to the source of the best coffee — that farm or washing station high atop a distant Ethiopian hill. It ends when they arrive at that distant farm, washing station, factory or mill. They sit down in a home or around a campfire to talk about this year’s crop with a producer they have met many times. They get to work.
      
 
          In Colombia, if you go to four farms you will get four bowls of sancocho, which is this soup with chicken, yucca, plantains, potatoes, corn, avocado. Basically, it’s as many calories as you can cram in a bowl.”
        
 
        The Green Team visits every producer as often as possible, sometimes up to three times per year. They constantly roast and taste the coffee, and they form long-term, lasting partnerships with the producers. They’ll help them implement a new farming technique that could lead to even better coffee. Or they’ll teach a seminar on a new way to process coffee cherry, which is the fruit of the coffee tree surrounding the seed or bean.
      
 
        They routinely pay producers up to four times what they could get for their crop on the commodity market, but in return, they ask for a lot more work—hand picking each cherry at ideal ripeness, or implementing a new piece of equipment.
      
 
        The Green Team also identifies potential future producers—maybe this side of the mountain has just the right climate, but the quality level isn’t there yet. Stumptown will invest in that farm, or mill, or factory if that producer is willing put forth effort to get the beans to the level the Green Team looks for. It’s a partnership, and there is prestige and pride involved. For a producer, selling to Stumptown means something.
      
 
        Above all, they want to help farms become sustainable and to set up strong businesses that build up their communities and produce the highest-quality coffee possible year after year.
      
 
          Our partners are much more than farmers, they are coffee production experts, constantly innovating practices in planting, harvesting and processing the best coffees around.”
        
 
        We don’t buy in bulk on a trading floor. We buy directly from the people who are making the coffee. It’s not a transaction; it’s a partnership. If someone is growing the quality of coffee we’re interested in, then we will help them in any way we can. That means regular visits (even though that trip can take up to four days), implementing new techniques and equipment, and forming long-term partnerships.
      
 
        We shoot for sustainability, and not just in the environmental sense. A sustainable coffee producer is someone who is paid fairly for their incredible work and who can in turn encourage others to follow in their footsteps. A sustainable producer innovates, develops and improves cultivation and in turn can fetch even higher prices from Stumptown. The more each side of the partnership puts in, the better the coffee gets.
      
 
        We don’t call them farmers, we call them producers, which gives credit to the fact that they are production experts. They are the ones who make this coffee great. They are the ones who are like-minded, who will go the extra mile for quality, whatever that means.

          Producers are the heart of what makes great coffee.
        
 
          Their skills, expertise and craftsmanship is the difference between mediocre coffee and coffee that is like nothing you’ve ever tasted before. The coffee will never get any better in quality once it lands in our hands, after all. We rely on the producers for that pristine bean. A good roaster works tirelessly to preserve that coffee’s inherent greatness.
        
 
          The producers grow the coffee trees. They pick the cherry when it is perfectly ripe. They remove the outer fruit, leaving just the bean covered in a thin parchment. They rest the beans, let the beans develop into their full selves.
        
 
          Everyone on this page does something slightly different — he may tend a small patch of coffee trees on the farm he inherited from his grandmother; she may oversee the cherry soaking in a big tank of water, fermenting at just the right rate.
        
 
          They live on four continents. They speak at least 30 different languages. Some use traditional methods that are centuries old; some have taken out four-year loans to get that new top-of-the-line piece of equipment that will lead to a greater, cleaner cup.
        
 
          It’s not the easy way. It’s not the fast way. It’s the right way, and it creates the best coffee possible.
        
 
        Coffee is a tree, and you probably prefer one branch to another, even if you don't know it yet.
      
 
        There isn’t one kind of coffee, there’s a coffee family tree.   For hundreds of years, humans have been cultivating, hybridizing and perfecting it, and today there are hundreds of types, or varieties.
      
 
        The variety of coffee tree matters—or at least, it usually does. Just as different types of grapes yield different wines, the variety of th
        e bean can have a profound impact on the finished cup.   
 
        There are hundreds of varieties, and we’ve chosen roughly a dozen that we find truly special. But here are the first ones you should know.
      
 
          So sweet, so complex and so delicate, this is the pinot noir of coffee. The plants are fragile and don’t produce as much cherry as some other varieties, but they’re worth the effort. A cup of Bourbon-type variety is lush and classic. It’s the coffee of coffee. It charms the snob and the rookie alike. And no, it has nothing to do with the delicious brown adult beverage, though we at Stumptown are big fans of that kind of bourbon, too.

          This is an offshoot of of the Typica family, which is delicate, floral, at times even citrusy. This variety was brought to Indonesia in the late 1600s by Dutch traders. We love it for its nuances and high, fine acidity. Villalobos in particular brings strong flavors of stone fruits like apricots, peaches and plums.
        
 
          The beauty of these is in their mystery. They are the wildflower varieties, descended from the natural coffee forests of southwestern Ethiopia. Each village has its own variety, handed down over centuries and shaped by the soil, elevation and weather.
        
 
Related: All of them, really but these in particular: Typica, Gesha

 
          Think of Gesha as coffee from an alternate dimension. It's like a Szechuan peppercorn, or the Sun Ra Arkestra, complex and otherworldly. It’s as far as it could be from diner coffee, a delicate, black-tea body, with a zest of bergamot. Gesha is picky—it will only grow when, where and how it wants, in tiny microclimates. But whether you grow it in Indonesia or the Americas, it is always thoroughly itself.
        
 
Related: Nothing. It’s in its own orbit.
        
 
        Which, finally, brings us to the very beginnings of coffee…
      
 
        Ten thousand years ago, the Coffea trees grew wild and tangly on the mountain slopes of southwestern Ethiopia.
      
 
        There, you can still find people performing traditional coffee ceremonies many times a day—one woman will prepare it for the circle of her friends and family who stand around her. She roasts it in a pan, grinds it, pours hot water over it, serves it in the predetermined social order.
      
 
        The Dutch traders, enamored of this tradition, brought cuttings of the plants to Indonesia. French missionaries, who also saw the beauty in this hot, euphoric brew, spread it throughout Africa and across the sea to the Americas.
      
 
        Today, coffee trees are cultivated in every hemisphere on four continents. In 70 countries, you will find those shrubs and their cherry. You’ll also find find the farmers who tend them, the pickers who select them, the processors who obsessively convert fruit to bean. You’ll find the roasters who delicately transform them, and you’ll find the coffee drinkers.
      
 
        You’ll find the earliest riser in the backpacking crew that stokes the fire and sets the water on to boil. You’ll find the barista who pulls the first shot of the morning for the go-getter. You’ll find the group of 70-year-old men in the diner at 6 a.m., spending hours discussing the issues of the day over their bottomless cups.
      
 
          Drinking coffee is a pleasure. Coffee drinking is fun, and it feels good, and every once in awhile I remember that we’re actually cultivating pleasure. Why do you put anything in your mouth? Because it’s delicious.”
        
 
        Everything that came before—the shrubs, the farmer, the journey across the sea, the hybrids and the mutations—is for this moment. Because the only thing required for the smallest, quietest and most personal of coffee ceremonies are some good beans and a way to brew.
      
 
        You’ll hold that mug possessively. You’ll inhale deeply. And then you drink.

 Producer: Multiple  Farm: Keffa Washing Station  Altitude: 6235 - 6560 feet  Region: Yirgacheffe  Varietal: Heirloom  Process: Washed  Roast: Light  Notes: Lemon Drops, Vanilla, Kiwi  
 This exceptionally complex Ethiopian from the Yirgacheffe region is the product of many small farmers' heirloom varietal coffee being processed immaculately.Keffa's Zero Defect Sorting, which takes 3 times longer to process than other coffees from the region, enhances its clarity in the cup and intensifies the aroma, sweetness, and acidity.
 This lightly roasted coffee features an orange blossom aroma, round body, and bright acidity. When brewed it has a flavor of lemon drops with a honey-vanilla sweetness and notes of kiwi and marshmallow in the finish.
 Why you'll love it: Our freshest green coffees are expertly blended and carefully roasted to create a brew that's sweet and seasonal.
 Story of the bean: When you cook a dinner of locally grown, seasonal vegetables, you know that the great taste is thanks to not only the chef, but to the farmer who grew the food with care and diligence. It’s the same with coffee. Quality starts at origin and, for us, the Origins blend is about giving credit where credit is due: with the farmer.  Farmers work hard to develop unique and distinct flavors in their high-quality coffee varieties. We designed this blend to bring those origin flavors forward, adapting our roasting style to downplay the smoky flavors the roaster creates. As a result, fruity, natural flavors like lemonade and blackberry really shine through. By changing the blend seasonally to highlight the freshest and sweetest-tasting coffees available, we’re getting back to our Origins.
 Blend notes: Lemonade, Blackberry, Black Tea

 While we take the seasonality of our single origin coffee menu very seriously, and have a lot of pride in the amount of rotation and freshness, we know it can be overwhelming to choose a single coffee when you have not had a chance to explore and taste the full menu.
 In the single origin sampler pack, you will receive three 4oz bags of our latest and most exciting single origin coffees, hand selected each week by our Head Roaster and Director of Coffee to offer a wide range of flavor profiles, and to give you a more complete perspective of our menu. 
 Note: Coffees are rotated in and out weekly, but there is always a chance of overlap in selections on a week to week basis. Please keep this in mind for any sequential orders of the sample pack in close proximity to one another.

REGION: Kayanza
VARIETAL: Bourbon
FARM: Mpanga Washing Station
ALTITUDE: 1800-2000M
FARMER: Jean Clement
ROAST: Medium
NOTES: #1 & #3 in Cup of Excellence, Washed

 
A clean, rich cup that brings out flavors of subtle spice, sweet cocoa with bright tangerine acidity and plum body, giving a unique and memorable drinking experience. 

    Located in the Kayanza region, Mpanga washing station is among the most well recognized producers of complex, clean specialty coffee in Burundi. Mpanga has garnered high scores in the Burundi Cup of Excellence, including 1st and 3rd place in the 2014 COE. The washing station was built in 2008 under the initiative of Jean-Clement Birabereye, who manages the mill  and represents the farmers through the trading company SEGEC (Societe General d'exploitation et d'exportation du Cafe). Jean-Clement boasts an incredible resume, with more than 15 years of experience in milling.  Through SEGEC, Birabereye offers a premium to producers whose coffees place in competition, motivating farmers to meticulous harvesting and agricultural practices. The station processes cherry from 300 families with plots of 10-50 trees on average, though a handful have more than 100. Mpanga is equipped with 450 drying beds, six disc McKinnon pulping machines and two pressers.  Total production is about 1,500 tons of cherry per year.

No organic certification is currently held by farmers due to cost, although they planting process and maintenance of farms are organic by default. The station prides itself on paying above market price for cherries to encourage high quality production at each harvest.

 San Sebastian represents one of our earliest projects in coffee sourcing. This producers group spans 400 smallholder farmers with plots in the micro region, based in the municipality of La Plata, within the department of Huila. San Sebastian is sourced seasonally throughout Colombia’s two harvests so as to offer the freshest possible crop at any given time. San Sebastian possesses heavy sugary notes and expresses fruited acidity. In the cup, we find brown sugar, dried fruits and a touch of baking spice.
 Fresh coffee is roasted every Sunday, Monday and Wednesday and shipped the following day. Please place your order by 5:00 PM Eastern Time the evening before the respective roast day to ensure that it is included.

 Bourbon coffee cherries thrive at over 2,000 meters above sea level in the mountains on Lake Kivu, where several hundred farmers deliver their coffee cherry to the Cotecaga washing station. At the station, the seeds are de-pulped from the coffee fruit using disc depulpers. They are then dry-fermented in tanks—imparting complex flavors—before being washed in long channels, soaked overnight, and then dried on raised beds. Organic production is common in Rwanda, though very few seek certification. We travel there annually to work directly with the station’s owner, C. Dormans, to cup lots of coffee separated throughout the harvest. This is the world exclusive lot to Olympia Coffee Lot 1 from the first week of the harvest.

 This is a fine example of a Swiss Water® Process coffee. A 100% chemical-free process that produces 99.9% caffeine free coffee.
 The Capucas Community has fought hard for their reputation of quality. Located near the Mayan ruins, on the western side of Honduras, the land was originally used for growing tobacco. It was repurposed for coffee until the 1950’s. Since that time they have led the way in modernization for the sake of consistency.
 This dependable coffee’s dark chocolate and sparkling apple qualities are the backbone of our entire decaf program.

 We couldn't help ourselves, but to get involved in this killer project by our friends at Gigantic Brewing Company and the legendary artist Shannon Wheeler.  The Too Much Coffee Man Beer is a rich Belgian Style Black Ale that combines the malt, floral, and fruit notes of a Saison with the caramel, honey, and graham of our cold brew coffee. At 8.2% alcohol and 134% delicious-awesomeness this beer does not fool around. It is a reward for your hard working taste buds.
 Check out this awesome video by Brew Age about how the collaboration began:
 Portlander's know Gigantic Brewing as the no-holds-barred star of innovation in our densely saturated market. They built their foundation with one of the best IPA's in the country before embarking on an endless campaign to make their seasonal releases unique and beautiful. Their "goal is simultaneously to create new interpretations of classic styles and to ignore those same style guidelines completely and brew whatever our creative natures produce."
 For each of these limited releases Gigantic partners with different artists for their labels. For our collaboration, we were floored to learn that Shannon Wheeler would being doing the art (and ultimately, lending his characters name to the brew). Shannon's Too Much Coffee Man has been poking fun and philosophizing through a syndicated comic strip for over twenty years. The satirical superhero has long been a favorite of many of Coava's crew and Shannon's involvement was the icing on the cake for us. 
 To arrive at the perfect balance of coffee to beer we spent a month working with Ben Love (Gigantic's brew master) to taste and evaluate many different coffees as well as roast profiles.
 Deliciousness through complexity and balance was our guiding star and the results are absolutely terrific. We can not wait for you all to try it.
 Availability: February-April in Oregon, Washington, California, British Columbia, Alaska, Chicago, Hatos Bar in Tokyo, and Mikkeller Bars in Copenhagen.

 One of the industry’s most revered professions is at risk. Service Sphere talks about its plans to reinvigorate technician training and the reason it’s in strife.
 
    There are a few careers that don’t require formal education to prove their ability, such air traffic controllers, Uber drivers, or administration staff. Now add to that list one of our industry’s most respected professions – coffee machine technicians.
 
    “There is a serious global shortage of good machine technicians,” Service Sphere’s National Business Development Manager David Burchett says. “It’s definitely a problem. With technologies advancing and trends changing, undoubtedly the future of the profession will be in serious jeopardy if we don’t take action to grow a new generation of specialised machine technicians.”
 
    David says one of the core reasons the profession isn’t attracting a strong uptake is because there’s not an industry standard, certification, or technical school to graduate from.
 
    “Trades such as an electrician, plumber, or builder require skill sets that are recognised by a formal industry body, meaning they’re more employable and sought-after by students because of their credibility,” David says. “Unlike electricians, we don’t crawl through holes and roofs, but we do navigate our way around a coffee machine, and that takes remarkable skill. Machine technician is one of those professions that needs to exist for the future of our industry. Without it...well, that’s a scary thought.”
 
    Rather than placing advertisements for a machine technician on Seek or the local newspaper, Service Sphere Service Manager Huw Harts says the company finds it easier to select passionate coffee people and train them internally.
 
    “You can have a mechanical and electronic engineering background but that doesn’t mean you’re a naturally gifted espresso machine technician. It’s about more than just having technical ability. You have to understand coffee and have a passion for it,” Huw says. “You have to know how coffee should look, how it feels, how it tastes and functions with different equipment, and how it reacts to water. There’s a lot to know.”
 
    Huw is one of Service Sphere’s 20 national service technicians who have such knowledge. He honed his skills through experience and persistence.
 
    Pre-2001 Huw worked in the catering industry in the United Kingdom before taking on service work for Electrolux, followed by CMA Macchine Per Caffè.
 
    “In catering I dealt with machines that had electrical and hydraulic circuits, which I was able to transpose onto a much smaller scale in coffee machines. Eventually I was responsible for managing 25 Version One Plus For You Astoria machines in Cyprus Airport, and all of Costa Coffee locations in Cyprus,” Huw says.
 
    With Greece’s economic downfall in 2013, Huw jumped at an invitation to travel 14,000 kilometres and work for Service Sphere in Melbourne.
 
    “I started working the day I arrived,” Huw says. “I was immediately surprised at the difference between coffee drinkers here in Australia and Europe.”
 
    Huw has been a member of the Service Sphere family for the past three years, and has serviced thousands of machines across a wide range of brands.
 
    To ensure the craft behind machine servicing remains at the forefront of our industry, he heads up Service Sphere’s Training Academy.
 
    The Academy is offering technical training courses for individuals looking at becoming an espresso machine technician, or wanting to gain a greater level of knowledge and appreciation for the functionality of coffee machines. At completion of training, attendees sit an exam and receive a certificate.
 
    “Technical training is about understanding how different machines function, learning how to diagnose faults, and how to address them correctly. It’s about improving everyone’s knowledge so more people understand the work we do and why,” Huw says. “A technician’s job is to understand cause and effect. There’s always a symptom and we need to find the cause. We need to understand the function of every machine component, what it impacts on, and how we can fix it if it fails.”

 Why You’ll Love It: With notes of almond and orange zest, this brew shows how climate, soil, and community can subtly change the familiar Central American coffee profile. Story of The Bean: La Llamada is a small micro lot on the La Bastilla farm, a Rainforest Alliance-certified producer for over 10 years. La Bastilla is extremely involved in the local community, and operates a primary school for 165 students, in addition to a technical agricultural school that teaches ecologically sound cultivation practices to over 50 students producing honey, dairy, vegetables, and coffee. This fully washed, Caturra-variety coffee takes on some of the bright citrus notes typical of higher altitude beans, but stays true to the sweet, full flavors of traditional Central American coffees. Nutty, syrupy almond notes balance out fruit flavors of red grape and orange, making this a coffee you'll crave every morning.

 Clean, juicy sweetness with mild acidity, pleasantly balanced with medium body.
 This blend is like one of the mixtapes you made for the person you really like-liked, but didn't know very well. It is balanced, a little bass-y and a little bright. The components meld together well, and most people will like it. We leave this blend open to change depending on the season, our offerings and what tastes yummy. It's a crowd pleaser, or it's for that special someone that you don't want to scare away with either Norwegian black metal or Jewel.

    The bean offers a sweet and delicate floral aroma mixed with flavors of peach, cherry, tangerine and tropical fruits along with subtle spices and dark chocolate. 
    
    Rodrigo Sánchez, along with his wife, Claudia Samboni, and daughter, Natlia, are the coffee entrepreneurs in charge of Finca Monteblanco. Monteblanco's name comes from its location, perched on the very top of a mountain, and often surrounded by clouds. Rodrigo has been farming coffee for almost 15 years now, and as of late, has started involvement in projects with three innovative partners in his locale, each with a complementary focus. 
Rodrigo first developed a curiosity to experiment with his coffees when he, along with Wbeimar Lasso's confirmation of nuances in cupping notes, discovered "La Caturra Purpura," or Purple Caturra. Only 26 trees out of a lot of 20,000 had this unique mutation in their development of leaf growth. Rodrigo now has now bred an entire lot of this variety in his second experimental farm.

It is farmers like Rodrigo who greatly excite us, as they are pushing our world of specialty coffee to new limits, identifying specific varieties, and experimenting with the use of current technologies to define the processing techniques these coffees deserve. This vector on the production side will undeniably call for a deepening response from roasters with the same ambition.

            Aromatic floral notes, tart cherries and hard candy, deep sweetness throughout.
              Whole Bean, 8oz

 A first-time offering for Sightglass, this coffee comes to us from the village of Wanja Qarsa in the Gera District of Jimma. This region is known for nutrient-rich soil and wild, heirloom varieties. Processing practices and equipment quality at cooperatives within this village have improved immensely over the past few years, and as a result, yield amazing coffees such as this one.

 To honor our long standing relationship with the Kochere Cooperative we are highlighting a dozen of their top scoring producers. These stalwarts have proven themselves through consistently delivering only the ripest of cherries. After processing and a period of rest we have the green coffee sorted for defects an additional two times longer than other lots coming out of Kochere. This Coava exclusive is named for the beautiful “blossoms” found on coffee trees before harvest.
 Black tea, honey comb, and sweet rose blossom mark the Meaza among the most delicious Ethiopian coffees we have ever tasted.

 Cupping is the ultimate tasting and evaluating tool in coffee, it's how we perform quality control, how we decide on green coffee purchase, how we assess consistency cup to cup. There is no better way to assess what a coffee is all about, and this class will show you how to cup like a pro. Will go over technique, scoring, and more.
 The class will be on June 18th at 7:00PM.
 Ever since we've been exposed to "Sugar Processed" Decafs, we've fallen in love. Ethanol is used to extract a solvent found in sugarcane, which extracts the caffeine. Definitely the gentlest non-chemical decaffeination, and to boot this is done in the same country as the coffee was produced, Colombia, also a rarity in decaffeination. Honestly, this just tastes like a really beautiful coffee from Colombia, it just happens to be Decaf.

 The ASOPEP cooperative represents 160 families growing coffee near the towns of Planadas and Ataco in Tolima, Coloimbia.  These small farms average only 2.5 hectares in size and grow Caturra, Castillo, Colombia, and Typica varieties of coffee.  Processing is done on the individual farms using traditional fermentation and a mixture of solar and mechanical drying.  The cup is rich and complex with notes of brown sugar and orange peel with a bright acidity.

 Our coffee is decaffeinated at the Descafecol plant in Manizales, Colombia by using a specialized "combination procedure" utilizing water and ethyl acetate derived from sugar cane molasses. Ethyl acetate is an ester that is found naturally in several fruits and vegetables and Manizales is known for its many sugar cane plantations, making great use of a local product. Ethyl acetate's low boiling point enables a gentle caffeine extraction from the coffee bean, while pressure or excessive heat treatment are avoided and the natural structure of the green coffee bean cells are retained. 
 Here are the parameters that we've been using with our latest Decaf Colombia La Serrania (parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket)
 A super barista exudes passion, exacting perfection, unswerving commitment and utmost pride.  To facilitate a greater understanding of the art and science of specialty coffee, the SuperBarista Artisan Roast was developed in conjunction with our coffee education facility to provide an immersive espresso experience.
 Excelling in the art of coffee, SuperBarista is designed to be ‘old-style’, in that it is a medium bodied coffee, and more subtle than many blends available.
 The SuperBarista Alliance was formed as a forum to connect with others in the coffee community, sharing ideas and staying up-to-date with upcoming events, coffee news and café reviews. Merging with The Northbridge Coffee Roasters’ Faculty of Espresso in late 2013, our onsite education centre is located on the next level to our operational artisan roasting facility and boasts enviable features such as eight operating commercial espresso machine workstations, alternative brewing method training areas, as well as a vast array of international coffee training resources.

 Developed as a specialty coffee in 2009, Superbarista by Braziliano is a subtly bright coffee with medium acidity.
 Mixed with milk, the mild and nutty smooth chocolate flavour lingers to showcase hints of oak and spice.  On its own as an espresso, The Superbarista blend holds its own with elements of juicy fruit and a sweet cedar aroma.

 A fresh and clean Chinese green tea exceptionally rich in antioxidants. Good for a boost whenever you need it.
 Ingredients: Spring harvested full leaf China green tea.

 Carefully picked at high elevation, the long, slender jade leaves of Mao Feng brew to a color of pale green and impart a pleasing vegetative fragrance with creamy notes and a lingering sweetness.
 Grown in the mountains of central Zhejiang Province at altitudes above 3000 feet, Mao Feng is harvested in the spring and quickly hot air fired. This neutralizes the oxidizing enzyme and seals in fresh flavors and aromas.

 Most coffee beers tend to be heavy, dark, and highlight roast or chocolate tones.  Java The Hop is a clean and complex coffee IPA made with single origin hops and single origin coffee.  As a company that prides ourselves so much on the quality of our single origin coffees, it is great to work with folks that take the same level of pride in their beer.  We love that this beer presents an opportunity to taste the origin - something that we strive to do day in, day out with our coffees.
 From Kiambu East District, Kenya, the Gichuna coffee beans grow on a family farm that has been passed down for multiple generations. They wet mill, ferment, and wash on site, then dry the beans on raised beds. Expect hints of caramel, molasses, and carob mixed with notes of ruhbarb, hibiscus, and currant.
 First bred by Yakima Chief Ranches, Simcoes are a unique American hybrid with a strong Northwest flavor. Aromas of passion fruit, apricot, and intense pine and woodsy aroma add to the fresh, youthful vigor of this complex hop.

 Orders sent to customers within Germany must select (DE 19% Tax) option which includes tax.
 Welcome to the world of automatic volumetric dosing!  We are happy to announce that we will be offering a first run (officially v2) of these units for sale worldwide.
 This dosing unit operates by placing carefully milled spacer rings inside a cylinder to create a fixed volume that slides effortlessly back and forth between the bottom of a hopper or funnel and the opening of an EK43 grinder.
 Our current series of units will feature a stainless steel funnel ring and an optional stainless steel top plate for the slider bar.  With some wear the slider bar can get stained from the coffee, so if you would like to have this option, please select it at check out.
 After some testing, we have concluded that this dosing unit is more accurate than the variance of standard grinding with the EK43.  With a full hopper we have trial tested the accuracy, with a full hopper, to be +- 2 coffee beans or around +- 0.2g.  What that number and weight is, depends on the evenness of the screen size of the beans.  Single origin coffees, in our testing were more accurate than blends or unevenly screen beans.
 While this unit is perfectly suitable for a high volume workflow, for ultra sensitive brewing it does not take the place of a scale.  However it can save a lot of time over pre-weighing doses and will pay for itself in time savings.
 All units come with enough 1,5mm POM rings to achieve a wide variety of dose sizes.
 We have a limited number of these v2 units being manufactured and we expect to ship our first set of orders from Berlin on June 9th with 3day FedEx worldwide. 
 All units come with a full warranty against defects of materials and craftsmanship in accordance with German law. 
 If you have questions please see our post and comments on our Facebook site.

 Over the years, we've been recognized by a number of local agencies and media for our great coffee. It's nice to think that people are that fond of Kaldi's, but we know that being a leader in the community isn't just about sharing a quality product, it's also about sharing your resources. For us, that has included:
 If you're interested in talking with Kaldi's about a community sponsorship or donation opportunity, please contact us.
 We don't create good coffee, we preserve it. 
 The coffee trade is long and slow. To get that fresh cup of Kaldi's coffee to taste its best, we start by sourcing the world's finest beans. That means constantly traveling to origin to find better coffees and let farmers know what we want. 
 Luckily, coffee is grown in many different places around the world. Each of these places has its own set of cultural habits regarding coffee cultivation. 
 Coffee does grow on a tree. These trees produces small, grape-sized cherries that usually contain two seeds. These two seeds are what we will eventually roast and turn into coffee "beans."
 To start with, different coffee producing regions grow different varietals of coffee that give each seed a unique flavor trait. Next, the coffee must be harvested from the trees. Picking ripe cherries instead of unripe cherries will vastly improve the final quality of a cup of coffee. Getting farmers to take this step of quality over quantity is one of the largest barriers to specialty coffee today.
 After harvesting, the coffee fruit must be removed from the seeds. This process is done in a number of ways that involves fermentation, washing/cleaning, and drying. The type of processing used gives the coffee a very unique flavor and is usually based on cultural traditions.
 Once the coffee beans are dry, they must go through a final milling process to remove a tough layer of skin surrounding the seed called parchment. The coffee is then sorted and cleaned.
 Getting coffee to Saint Louis in a timely manner after harvest is also a challenge. The fresher the crop, the more delicious the cup. We have tried to improve upon this freshness by using new shipping materials that are less prone to aging, absorbing scents, and trapping moisture.
 When the coffee finally arrives, we sample roast and cup it a number of times to determine a roast profile. Last, we do our best every day to preserve and present that quality to you.

 Juicy, creamy, and elegant. A complex and radiant coffee that rewards close attention. 
 A little bit of everything in this remarkable Kenyan. You taste the full spectrum here from tart grapefruit and juicy nectar to a creamy and chocolate cordial finish.

 In Kenya, farmers deliver their coffee cherry to a member-run washing station, known as a factory, where the coffee is processed. In 2005, Karogoto merged with Ngunguru and Tegu factories to form the Tekangu Farmer Cooperative Society. The 2900 members of Karogoto Factory cultivate their SL28 and SL34 varieties in rich red volcanic soil.
 Located about 100 miles from Nairobi in the Nyeri district, Karogoto Factory is a washing station at the foothills of the volcanic Mount Kenya and the Aberdare mountain range. The region just South of the equator is known for its dramatic waterfalls and rugged terrain and is home to some of the most beautifully complex coffees in the world.

 The production of exceptional coffees is a collaborative, meticulous and multi-faceted effort. All coffees are sourced in freshly harvested lots through direct relationships with producers and cooperatives committed to quality and sustainable business practices. We travel to origin throughout the year, exploring new coffee sources, checking in with cherished producers, and offering premiums for quality. The long-standing partnerships we nurture are built upon trust—trust that our producers will convey to us what they need to thrive and trust that we will do everything we can to support them. Visit Our Company page to learn more about our sourcing practices.
 We work to bring forth the unique flavors from each farm or cooperative to your cup in the most humble, efficient, and honorable way possible. We achieve this by taking meticulous care throughout the roasting process. Practicing smaller production methods and sensory roasting allow us to find the best expressions for each coffee. Using our eyes, ears, nose, and most importantly our taste buds, we evaluate our coffees on a regular basis to ensure we are showcasing the very best attributes of each.
 For a coffee to be certified organic by the USDA, strict regulations and certifications are enforced at all levels of production. As the farms we partner with don’t always possess the financial resources to gain these certifications, we don’t require our coffees to be USDA Organic or Fair Trade Certified. However, most of the farms we work with practice organic and ecologically conscious growing methods. Through direct trade, we are able to offer producers substantially higher prices for their coffee.
 All coffees have a shelf life, and should ideally be served within fourteen days of the roast date. Coffee will taste best when ground immediately before brewing. Grind only the amount of coffee you plan to brew and store the remainder in an airtight container, away from direct sunlight, heat, and sources of humidity. Avoid putting your coffee in the refrigerator or freezer.  
 Because coffee is a seasonal fruit, we source it from origin in tiny, freshly harvested lots. Harvest cycles happen throughout the year, with coffees from different regions landing at different times. Once a shipment arrives stateside, we have a few months to roast and serve the coffee. As a result, you will rarely see a particular single origin coffee on our menu for more than a few months at a time as we will only serve coffees at their finest and freshest. We work to curate a very special coffee experience for you, both in our coffee bars and when you’re brewing our beans at home. If you would like help choosing a coffee, please contact info@sightglasscoffee.com and we can provide some recommendations.
 You can use any coffee with any brew method, although some sing better than others when made with different brewing devices. In general, brew methods will either highlight the flavor clarity of a coffee or highlight the body and mouthfeel. For example, a french press, because it has a metal filter, allows oils and insoluble components to enter your final cup of coffee, which enhances the coffee’s overall body. A Chemex, because of its thick paper filter, catches a lot of those insoluble components and emphasizes clarity. At our cafes, we brew all coffees through a V60 or Fetco as we feel that gives us a balanced representation of each coffee without favoring one aspect of its flavor profile. If you want to have fun and experiment, for coffees that are complex and have lots of delicate flavors, like most East African coffees, try a brewer with a paper filter. For coffees with a noteworthy heaviness and mouthfeel, like Central and South American coffees, try a full-immersion brewing method.
 Our coffees are served at a variety of wonderful cafes, restaurants, and other establishments throughout the country (and internationally!). You can also purchase many of our offerings, including seasonal single origin favorites and year-round staples, in our webstore. For more information on where to find our coffees near you, please email info@sightglasscoffee.com.

 Throughout the years of civil war and unrest in Nicaragua, Don Anibal kept growing low‐rise vegetables like bell pepper, onions, and cabbage on his valley farm. He was moderately successful, but his dreams were up in the clouds. When peace finally came to the Nubarrones, that’s exactly where he went: the highlands of Nubarrones (“thunderclouds”).
 Up in the Nubarrones, he bought a modest 37 acres‐‐that’s about two Dolores Parks, for you locals. Unlike Dolores Park, this farm lacked roads. There are probably a lot of other things at Dolores Park that Anibal’s new farm lacked, but a way to and from the moutainside farm… well, that was a bit of a hurdle.
 Don Anibal spent more of his vegetable farm profits on a few mules to ferry supplies up and down until he finished the road. He expanded the farm in all directions. All the while, Anibal’s long‐held dream continued to glow in the back of his mind: the chance to start a coffee farm, up among the clouds.

 On New Year’s Day we woke up at Ryan the roaster’s house. Some people were getting antsy to wade through the rain to a café or bar or something, but Ryan the roaster wasn’t having it. “It’s nice and warm here,” he said.“Let’s all just take our shirts off, and relax.”
 That’s how we got the idea for this subscription. We want everyone to stay home, take their shirts off, and relax. We also ship to offices, where you can enjoy all the benefits of our subscription program except for the part about staying home, removing your shirt, and relaxing.
 No matter where you are, the “single origin” subscription gets you a different coffee from a single origin (like a certain farm in Guatemala or co-op in Ethiopia) each delivery. If you are getting more than one bag, each coffee will be different. We choose; you enjoy. The “espresso” subscription gets you Friendo Blendo unless you get more than one bag, in which case we throw in a single origin espresso with each delivery. We roast; you relax.

 This sampler pack includes 2.5-oz tubes featuring three of Todd's favorite coffees from around the world.
 Haiti - For Haiti: Not only does this coffee taste delicious and refreshing when brewed hot or cold, it also represents a commitment to support and nurture the Haitian coffee industry.
 Ethiopia - YirgZ: Yirg for Yirgacheffe, Z for zero defect. Ethiopian coffees from the Yirgacheffe region are world-renowned for producing distinctively floral and aromatic coffee. "Zero defect" means this coffee is triple sorted by size, color, and density until it reaches a point of near perfection. This new harvest is on a new level of coffee obsession. The mountains and soil of the Yirgacheffe region are known for producing coffees with floral and citrus aromas. Our importing partner, Samuel Demisse, has amplified this reputation by employing a rigorous sorting process in Ethiopia.
 Brazil - Blue Diamond: In the 1940s, coffee consumption was beginning to soar and Brazilian coffee producers struggled to find a coffee tree that could withstand the strong winds and rain in the tropical savannas south of the Amazon. The solution was a hybrid plant called Catuai, a highly productive dwarf variety prized for its sweetness. With rich chocolate flavor and a full body, the Blue Diamond is a shining example of a Brazilian Catuai.

 Our Guji Uraga is now a WINNER in the 2016 Good Food Awards
 Below is a press release from the Good Food Awards-
 2016 GOOD FOOD AWARD WINNERS ANNOUNCED
 The 176 Winners feted by Alice Waters, Nell Newman, Carlo Petrini and 800 Guests 
 SAN FRANCISCO, CA (January 15, 2016) – Over 800 people gathered tonight to pay tribute to 176 Good Food Award Winners of 2016. By the majestic Golden Gate Bridge on the San Francisco Bay numerous farmers, chefs, journalists, and activists united to celebrate the exceptional food crafters including luminaries Alice Waters, Nell Newman and Slow Food Founder, Carlo Petrini.
 The winners harken from 33 states, having risen to the top amongst 1,937 entries in a Blind Tasting with 203 judges held in September. The highest scoring entries were submitted to a rigorous vetting process to verify they met the sustainability and social responsibility criteria to win a Good Food Awards – with over two dozen ultimately disqualified. This year’s winners represent the forefront of American craft food, making products that are delicious, respectful of the environment, and connected to communities and cultural traditions. As Good Food Awards Founder Sarah Weiner noted in her closing remarks: “Twenty years ago, it took travelling across the globe to encounter something so exquisite that it jolted me into seeing the world with new eyes. Now, you are giving people a taste of how good life can be right here on our own soil…changing America’s definition of Good Food.”

 Dario Quilindo is a producer in the Huila Dept of Colombia. This is a micro-lot that has seen its second export to the United States in 2016. The coffee was imported through Coffee Shrub and Bar Nine has committed to the entire production of the micro-lot, making it exclusively available through us this year.
 Our roast days are Monday and Wednesday. All coffee is roasted to order and ships one day after the day it was roasted.
 ﻿All of our coffee is now flushed with nitrogen when bagged, creating an inert atmosphere that improves freshness. An unopened bag of coffee can now retain freshness for 4+ weeks.

 Roasting is the mark we put on the coffees we source, we translate the work of the coffee producer into the nearly finished product. The roast is a hugely transformative part of coffee’s path from seed to cup. Through heat, time and intuition, we transition the coffee from an ultra dense, bitter and fibrous state to a form we can grind, brew and enjoy.
 We aim to roast in such a way that brings out our favorite flavors in each particular coffee. We never push our presence with roast flavor, but we have well developed coffees that are deliciously drinkable. No two coffees are the same; even from year to year the crop from the same farm changes. Roasting requires attention to detail and responsiveness to the changing coffee and environment. With every roast, every day, we taste and adjust and learn more about the coffees and the craft of coffee roasting.
 At its core, roasting coffee is a craft and a science. In the real world, it’s a production job that requires responsiveness to an ever-changing product and a skill for repeatability and consistency. There is so much scooping and lifting and heat and noise and sniffing and frustration and satisfaction. We try to maintain a consistent product while being able to explore the possibilities of each coffee, and we do it every day so that the coffee we’re putting out in the world is as fresh as can be! 
 We try super hard. Please just like us. :)
 Dogwood Coffee Company exists to support and spread the enjoyment of delicious coffee. Our participation is rooted in relationship, cultivated by discipline and grown through original expression.

            A great single origin is a truly exceptional coffee that highlights the intrinsic qualities of that region while being able to stand on its own as a unique and enjoyable cup of coffee.

 El Manzano Caturra Microlot is sourced from the Luis Gómez family farm in the small department of Nariño—roughly the same square area as the state of Maryland. Nariño borders Ecuador and the Pacific Ocean, but has an extremely diverse geography. Hot plains lie on the Pacific Coast, lush Amazon tropics occupy the central region, and the Andes Mountains traverse north to south along the inland border.
 It is this Andean region that put Nariño on the map as a top coffee producer in the 1990s, when high-volume coffee buyers turned to the region’s farms as source of choice for its excellent coffee. This trend discouraged farmers from producing higher priced, premium coffees.  As these buyers migrated much of their business to other countries, premium coffee demand simultaneously increased and farmers saw an opportunity to sell their unique offerings. Collaborations have resulted, building a network of resources for these farms.
 Luis Gómez and his family have justly reaped the benefit of this shift. The Gómez farm has seen improved efficiency, increased earnings from their coffee sales, and strengthening of their family’s livelihood.
 Cupping notes : Sweet-smoky, Tamarind, Layered

 Our Organic Colombia Tolima comes from the municipality of Planadas in the southern tip of the Tolima Province. Lying in the foothills of the Central Andes, Tolima is known for its mineral-rich soils and fresh water. Though relatively unknown in the coffee industry until recently, Tolima is now the country’s third largest coffee producer and is increasingly being recognized for producing great tasting coffee.
 The beans in this lot come from two small cooperatives in Planadas: ASOPAP and Resguardo Indígena Nasa We’sx.
 The 29 members of the ASOPAP cooperative are fully committed to quality coffee and organic standards from their farms, which are situated at 5,400-6,200 feet. Their beans have yielded excellent cup profiles for some time, drawing attention from international coffee traders.
 The Nasa We’sx are an indigenous community brought to Planadas in the early 1900s by the Colombian Army as a mine workforce. For decades, they were caught in the conflict between the army and the largest guerilla group in the country, FARC, until recently, when they made a peace pact with local guerrillas.
 Cupping notes : Jammy Strawberry, Guava, Bartlett Pear

 To drink a cup of Ethiopia Nigusse Lemma is to connect with the origins of coffee.  Beans from Ethiopia’s Limu woreda (district) deliver unique flavors that can only be discovered in heirloom varietals.  Located in the southwestern part of country, Limu is not as well known as Yirgacheffe or Harrar, but deserves the attention that it is receiving.
 Our Ethiopia Niguisse Lemma is sourced from the family farm of Lemma Edeto and is located in the highest elevations of the Limu region.  Shade from old growth trees, water from spring fed stream, and native varietal of coffee that flourish organically are in no better hands than the Edeto Family.  Lemma, with over 60 years in the coffee industry, has passed down the knowledge to his sons Nigusse and Haile, who operate the farm which their father recovered after it was confiscated by the Derg regime in the 1970’s.  The family’s commitment to quality includes a fully natural dry processing that insures no unripend cherries taint the taste of the finished product.  Fully control from farming to milling has resulted in award-winning coffee.  Nigusse and family were recently honored for the African Taste of the Harvest competition awarded by the African Fine Coffee Association.

 This coffee comes to us from the farm of Welser Hernandez, just outside the town of Jacaltenango in the Huehuetenango Region of Guatemala. It’s here that Mr. Hernandez grows and processes his coffee—in the Sierra Madre Mountains that lie in the Western Highlands of the country. Though growing altitudes range from 4,300-5,900 feet, the dry, hot winds from the Mexican plains fend off the threat of frost, naturally protecting the vegetation. After harvest, the beans—predominantly Bourbons and Caturra—are fully washed, then sundried, yielding the coffee bean that we call “Guatemala Mr. Hernandez”, in honor of his commitment to quality.
 Cupping notes : Milk chocolate, Medjool Dates, Raspberry
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Guaya’b is a cooperative of over 300 indigenous Mayan and Quichua farming families in the region of Jacaltenango, Huehuetenango. Since the introduction of coffee into the Jacaltenango region 40 years ago natural habitats, flora and fauna have slowly made a comeback from the once de-forested land. The recreation of the natural habitat has allowed for the reduction of soil erosion, restored natural habits and given the coffee crops a lush canopy that allows them to ripen slowly.
 Rich & delicately fruity; you’ll experience a thought provoking brew that begins with a chewy, chocolaty body that develops into a raspberry jaminess infused with deeper, bright fruit tones that suggest currant and strawberry.
 Cupping notes : Red D’anjou Pear, Raspberry Honey, Malt
Roast level : MEDIUM-LIGHT
 Deep in the interior folds of the Southern Sierra Madre Mountains in Chiapas, Mexico is the coffee growing cooperative of Ramal Santa Cruz. Among this multitude of coffee farms lies the home of Augustin Sanchez Espinoza and his three brothers who all farm together on adjacent parcels of land. The farms of the Brothers Sanchez are at the upper reaches of viable coffee cultivation, starting at 1600 meters and topping at just over 1800 meters, the highest of all coffee grown in the cooperative. The family began planting coffee on the land in the early 1970s. Many of the original plants are still producing. The majority of the coffee is Typica and Bourbon with a scattering of more recently planted Caturra.
 The coffee from these four brothers and their farms make up our Mexico Fair Trade, Organic, Ramal Santa Cruz, Cuatro Hermanos.  This coffee greets you with a red danjou pear citrus acidity followed with hints of raspberry honey and Meyer lemon.  We hope you will enjoy this extraordinarily smooth coffee from the Cuatro Hermanos.
 Cupping notes : Nectarine, Cherry, Caramel

 Situated near a gorilla habitat in the mountains of Central Rwanda, the Dukunde Kawa is a cooperative of 2000 member farmers, more than 80% of whom are women. Its award winning coffees and support from local and international sources have greatly benefited the producers’ families. In 2003, the cooperative was able to build its first washing station with funding from the Rwandan Ministry of Defense. In turn, the cooperative now donates 10 percent of its net profit annually to fund the construction of other washing stations throughout the country. Since receiving Fair Trade certification in 2004, Dukunde Kawa has implemented a direct training program and continued to improve the standard of living for its farmers.
 This coffee is 100 percent Bourbon varietal, grown at high altitudes ranging from 1,500 – 2,000 meters above sea level, which allows for slower ripening and cooler fermentation temperatures. The Bourbon cultivar and extended fermentation process, along with meticulous washing and sorting, produce a lush coffee with complex fruit notes.
 Cupping notes : Hops, Orange Bitters, Tobacco Leaf

 Our Sumatra Samosir Honey is a unique lot. It is the result of collaboration by three coffee growers from the Lake Toba region of Northern Sumatra. What makes this lot different lies in the coffee processing. Sumatran growers are known for using the unique process of “wet hulling” coffee. But these Lake Toban farmers have taken a still different approach using what is know as the “honey” process—a process originated in Central America but rarely used in Asia. The differences are not only interesting, they result in an entirely different flavor profile.
 The Wet Hulled Process, common to most Sumatran coffees, begins with the coffee being pulped and washed. This removes the sugary mucilage layer, as is done with all washed coffees. The difference with wet hulled coffees is, the beans are removed from their protective parchment layer before they have been allowed to fully dry. This premature exposure of the beans results in Sumatran coffee’s distinctive musty, earthy flavors. The Honey Process, used in producing this Sumatran, is named for the sticky mucilage found once the coffee cherry skin is removed. It is sometimes referred to as “honey”. During the Honey Process, coffee is fully dried with the sugary mucilage before the sugar laden parchment is removed from the bean. The result is a coffee with good sweetness and body but with flavors that are cleaner than traditional Sumatran coffee.
 Kiumu landed stateside early this year thanks in part to the collaboration with our export partners in Kenya. Kiumu represents the next chapter in our mission to develop a quality-founded relationship coffee with a single estate producer in the region. Last year, this budding exploration brought us to Muranga County. During our travels we were fortunate to meet John Njoroge, who owns and personally manages Kiumu, a parcel of a 100 acre estate which he shares with his brothers. Parlor is in the nascent stage of an exclusive relationship with John: we purchased every one of John’s Kiumu lots this year because we believe in the potential of this coffee. John Njoroge’s Kiumu is ripe with flavors coveted in the finest Kenyan coffees: juicy stone fruits meld with citrus notes and make way for a remarkable flavor of fresh blackberry. We are excited for the evolution of this relationship coffee throughout this season and for seasons to come.
 Fresh coffee is roasted every Sunday, Monday and Wednesday and shipped the following day. Please place your order by 5:00 PM Eastern Time the evening before the respective roast day to ensure that it is included.

 This is a blend of Guatemalan and Ethiopian coffees that have gone through the Mountain Water Process.
 Producer: Multiple Small-Holders  Farm: San Pedra La Laguna Mill  Altitude: 4900 - 5250 feet  Region: San Pedro La Laguna, Atitlan  Varietal: Typica, Bourbon, Caturra, Catuai  
 Process: Mountain Water Process  Roast: Medium  Notes: Caramel Hard Candy, Candied Almonds, Tangerine  
 This is a blend of Guatemalan and Ethiopian coffees that have gone through the Mountain Water Process.
 Atitlan’s soil is rich with organic matter; 90% of coffee in Atitlan is cultivated along volcanic slopes that surround Lake Atitlan. Daily winds stir the cold lake waters influencing variations in the micro-climates of the region.
 This coffee comes from the Sidama region of Ethiopia. Small-holder farmers bring their coffee to the wet mill where it is sorted for quality, then washed and dried.
 This coffee has been decaffeinated using the Mountain Water Process, a chemical-free method for removing the caffeine from green coffee beans. The process involves charging water with a coffee extract that includes all of the dissolvable solids of green coffee, minus the caffeine. This is done by soaking a batch of green coffee until the dissolvable solids are extracted. The coffee is discarded while the water is passed through a carbon filter that removes the caffeine, creating the coffee extract. A new batch of green coffee is then soaked in this extract. The caffeine is drawn out of the coffee leaving the other dissolvable solids (flavor compounds) in the bean. Finally the extract is passed through the carbon filters again to remove the caffeine and the process begins again.
 This medium roasted decaf blend features a caramel hard candy aroma, silky body, and lively acidity. When brewed it has a candied almond flavor with a tangerine sweetness. The finish has a pleasantly spicy black pepper note along with subtle mint.

                A simple device for making excellent coffee. 
The Aeropress makes one cup of coffee in less than two minutes.
It's light weight and durability makes it the perfect travel companion for the demanding coffee traveler.           
 Here is our basic Aeropress recipe for a filter like coffee:
Rinse the paper filter with running tap water for 10 secondsUse 14 grams of freshly fine filter ground coffee (light roast)Pour 200g of water at about 95°C over the coffee.Stir 3 times and steep for 60 seconds.Place the handle on the Aeropress in order to prevent the water from draining through the filter.After 60 second steep time, take the handle off, stir 3 times back to front.Then place the handle on top of the aeropress and press the contents into a large cup or pitcher by using your body weight
For a stronger coffee similar to the one made on a Bialetti pot, you can follow this recipe:
Rinse the paper filter with running tap water for 10 secondsUse 20 grams of espresso roasted coffee ground for Bialetti moka pots (quite fine)Pour 100 – 150g of water brought to a boil (straight from the water boiler) on the ground coffee.Give the brew 3 vigourous stirs.Press by using your body weight and enjoy.
  is back-ordered. It will be back as soon as possible!
 The AeroPress is a coffee making system ideal for travel, or brewing a small amount at the home or office. It makes a very clean, sediment-free cup in a short period of time, and it is easy to clean up. You just need ground coffee, hot water, and a mug (ideally you brew directly into a mug, not included in the kit).
 Brewing with the AeroPress gives good control over the variables - you can easily adjust the water temperature or water-to-coffee ratio to change the results. In my tests, the cup results match both the full pot Technivorm brews and my cupping results (the process where we mix grinds directly with water and use a spoon to taste many coffees at once.)
 Here is an instructional video with more info on brewing with this!
 A lot of our coffees are prepared quite nicely with this method. It does add a bit more body to the coffee than a v60 does.

 The Capucas Community has fought hard for their reputation of quality. Located near the Mayan ruins, on the western side of Honduras, the land was originally used for growing tobacco. It was repurposed for coffee until the 1950’s. Since that time they have led the way in modernization for the sake of consistency.
 This dependable coffee’s dark chocolate and sparkling apple qualities are the backbone of our entire decaf program.

 The climate and geography of Eastern Congo are a dream for growing coffee. However, to live in Congo is truly a nightmare. 
 Lake Kivu comes to us from the over 5,600 members of the Sopacdi cooperative, on the shores of Lake Kivu. Most of these farmers have recently returned to their homes after being driven away by the rebel troops spilling over from Rwanda. Over twenty percent of the cooperative’s membership are women. Many are widows whose husbands died trying to smuggle their coffee into Rwanda while the Conogolese market was virtually non-exsistent. They live in small, remote villages in the mountainous highlands surrounding Lake Kivu. The cooperative is headquartered in the village of Minova, where they just completed building the first coffee washing-station in Congo in over forty years. Additionally, this is the first coffee from DR Congo to acheive the top national grade - Kivu 2 - since 1967.
 Lake Kivu’s first sip springs forward with tones of fresh cherry, developing into notes of fresh-cut flowers, clementine, peach, and buttery pie crust. As the cup cools, the floral tones open up into earthy green tea acting as a nice foundation for the brighter, sweet fruit we see in the forefront. This coffee is very juicy, turning into a slightly dry effervescent mouth-feel in the finish which reminded us of Bottle Cap candies. It is the perfect coffee to greet the oncoming summer sunshine.

 Producer: Armando Benavides Portilla   Farm: Finca Santa Maria   Altitude: 6069 feet  Region: Nariño, Colombia  Varietal: Caturra  Process: Washed  Roast: Light  Notes: Caramel, Green Apple, Sweet Lime  
 Finca Santa Maria is one of our favorite Direct Trade partners. During our visits to the farm, we have always been impressed with their level of commitment to sustainability and quality. On top of the farming initiatives, the thing that impresses us most about the farm is the family values. To Armando, the most important thing is the relationship. He stressed the importance of passing on his passion for coffee farming to his children and the benefits of a strong relationship with us, the buyers. Good management goes well beyond producing great coffee, it is about coming together with enriching experiences, family and friendship. 
 The growing conditions at Finca Santa Maria and the Nariño region are very unique. Located at over 6000 feet, its long hours of sunlight and hot springs allow the coffee trees to grow in higher, colder altitudes. This leads to a bean we value for its greater level of sweetness and acidity. Armando is also focused on innovations they have been implementing on the farm, such as irrigation, traditional processing methods and the introduction of new varietals.

 Tasting Notes: Toasted Almond, Milk Chocolate, Gentle Apple Acidity
 Keystone is our take on the classic drip blend. Clean, light, and extremely balanced, with just a hint of refreshing acidity. 
 Your coffee will be roasted and shipped the next business day from when you place your order.

 Lots of love from Ethiopia. Muscovado Sugar and Jasmine start the journey and they fall into a bed of Apricots. We can't stop. 
 Region: Shakiso, OromiaFarm: Kayon Mountain Varietal: TypicaAltitude: 1900–2200 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed & Sun Dried
 The Kayon Mountain Coffee Farm is owned by multiple families that have been born and raised around the experience of coffee. These share-holding members had mainly been supplying coffee to auction for the past 30 years until they started their farm in 2012. This farm boasts a 500 hecatarespread, of which half is planted in heriloom Typica coffee and the other land reserved for cabbage, and indigenous shade trees. By 2015, they had implimented washing stations and dry-hullers allowing them to start exporting their own coffees and now see an annual production of about 300 tonnes. The coffees see an average fermentation time of 24-26 hours, followed by an average drying time of 12-20 days. As for the future, Kayon Mountain plans to plant more coffee, improve the quality of their processing, and even begin leasing more land to expand their practice.
 The ECX was started in 2008 to help protect farmers from market forces that might prevent them from making a living. Most of the coffee in Ethiopia is produced by small-holders who own 0.7 hectares, bumper crops often lead to big price drops, which can make it unprofitable for farmers to harvest their coffee. What the ECX does is commoditize grains- including sesame, beans, maize, wheat, and most importantly, coffee. This ensures prompt payment to farmers. It also integrates all parts of the “eco-system” involved in a grains market, including warehousing, grading, trading, and payment. Access to information is emphasized, as farmers can obtain information about trading prices and local delivery points easily through dedicated telephone lines.
 Here is a general rundown of how the ECX chain works in Ethiopia:
 While this system does ensure prompt payment and streamlines supply chain issues, it removes essentially all traceability from the coffee. This is problematic in the specialty world, where traceability is paramount.
 The ECX does not allow for complete traceability, but coffee cooperatives in Ethiopia do have the ability to go around the ECX and export the coffee themselves. Coffees that are exported by a cooperative can have traceability, possibly even to a single farmer.

 Reko is consistently one of our favorite coffees year after year, and 2016 is no exception. Beautiful rose and blackberry, a gentle but bright acidity, this is as lovely of a fresh crop Yirgacheffe you could ask for.
 Cultivar: Local Heirloom, KurumeRegion: Yirgacheffe, EthiopiaProcess: washedOur roast days are Monday and Wednesday. All coffee is roasted to order and ships one day after the day it was roasted.
 ﻿All of our coffee is now flushed with nitrogen when bagged, creating an inert atmosphere that improves freshness. An unopened bag of coffee can now retain freshness for 4+ weeks.

 Forty years ago, a cup of coffee was nothing more than a caffeine delivery vehicle. It didn't really matter how it tasted, it just had to slap you awake in the morning or prop you up through a long afternoon. But in the last decade or so, things have changed. A lot. A few people scattered across the country discovered how amazing a cup of coffee can be when you source the beans directly from farmers you know. When you roast the beans yourself in such a way that nothing intrinsic to the coffee is removed. When you brew the coffee with down-to-the-second precision.
 Ritual has been a pioneer in this delicious shift in coffee consciousness since we opened our doors on Valencia Street in 2005 and started what some call a coffee revolution in San Francisco. Our goal then--and our goal now--is to craft the very best cup of coffee available anywhere. Period. We've learned a lot over the years, but the care and attention we lavish on our process is unchanged, including tasting every coffee several times before it goes out to our coffee bars and into your cup.
 We don't do all of this to make coffee more complicated. We do it because pretty much everybody who works here has had a moment where a really, really good cup of coffee changed their lives.

 Our green buying team constructed this regional lot while cupping dozens of freshly harvested coffees in Antigua at Bella Vista Mill in January. In our search, small producer lots from Chimaltenango stood out as the most fruited, vibrant and sweet coffees available. To present the best possible offering, we decided upon constructing this blend from our three top-scoring lots. Chimaltenango is a central region in Guatemala and possesses many of the ideal characteristics to produce exceptional coffees: 1800 to 2000 meters of altitude paired with a vast majority of Caturra and Bourbon varieties make for a solid foundation of quality. This cup leads with aromatics and flavors of toffee and nougat and continues to become more vibrant as it cools with a dynamic display of flavors ranging from black cherry to milk chocolate to cashew butter.

    The San Sebastian is a coffee showcasing the work of small shareholders in the municipality of La Plata in Huila. The coffee is produced by the Asociacion de Productores de Cafe de Alta Calidad del Occidente del Huila (OCCICAFE).  The profile found in this coffee is the result of piecing together around 30 exceptional lots to create a clean and sweet cup.  Nearly one thousand lots are cupped to build a lot of this size and quality. The growers involved in OCCICAFE all work side by side with quality analysis and are responsible for the harvesting, milling and drying of their coffee. La Plata is a small town of about 50,000 residents which was initially named San Sebastian de La Plata by early settlers. While La Plata has historically been known for silver, today’s economy is mostly agriculture. This season will mark the 5th harvest we have purchased from San Sebastian!
 This delicious coffee comes to us through a strong relationship between Joe and the El Paraiso growers association in Huila. From the beginning of our roasting adventure, El Paraiso has connected Joe with a number of excellent, high-quality Colombian coffees. In fact, Joe currently purchases 40% of El Paraiso’s annual output. This particular selection was grown by a special group of El Paraiso’s member farmers: The Guarnizo Family. 
 The Guarnizo family is comprised of 9 brothers and 1 sister who own and operate 6 total farms in the area surrounding the town of Tarqui. Their 6 farms sit between 1600 and 1800 meters in elevation on the eastern slopes of the Central Cordillera in the Andes Mountains. They primarily grow Caturra and Colombia varieties with plantings of Yellow Caturra and Geisha planned for the next few years. Processing and drying here is very simple but carefully monitored. The cherries are placed in a tank filled with water where the floating cherries are separated from the higher quality, denser cherries that sink to the bottom. After passing through a basic depulping machine with a small amount of water, the seeds are then fermented for 24 hours in tile-lined tanks. After fermentation, the coffee is washed in the same tank with fresh water before being placed on raised beds to dry. 
 The Guarnizos dry their coffee in shade for about a week before moving it to a sunnier, covered solar dryer where it will dry slowly for another 10-15 days. They carefully monitor the temperature and humidity in the dryer and regulate them by opening or closing ventilation flaps in the structure. The beds remained covered because of the unpredictable rains in this region of Colombia. When the coffee is dried to the proper level, they will deliver their parchment coffee to the El Paraiso warehouse for quality assessment and payment. 
 Our initial conversations with El Paraiso involved having a fixed-price contract with one or two of the Guarnizo family farms but the Guarnizos banded together to include all 6 farms. They and Joe agreed on a quality minimum, based on El Paraiso’s cupping scores and a quantity over the course of a year. The fixed contract allows the entire family to count on a steady price for their higher quality coffees while easing some of the worry of market volatility with what would be differentially- priced coffees based on a fluctuating commodities market. It’s a true win-win agreement. 
 This part of Colombia has 2 harvests per year. The first semester runs from April-July while the second usually runs from October-December. The two growing periods allows us to have fresh coffee from these farms all year round.
 All orders are roasted on Monday and Thursday and are shipped on the same day. Note that if you order Two-Day Shipping after 7am on any given day, your order will be processed *the following roast day*. We do this to ensure your coffee arrives to you as fresh as possible!
 All coffee is delivered whole bean. If you need your order ground, please specify your brew method in the special instructions section.

 While quite a few manufacturers produce similar filters, we like these best. They aren't bonded with harsh glues or chemicals and are not whitened with bleach. Rather, Filtropa uses an oxygen-based whitening process without chlorine. We've also found that these do not impart that papery taste that other paper filters sometimes do. 100 filters per pack.

 A Costa Rican gem of a coffee. We are proud to have been able to pull out all the Plum sweetness and deep flavors of Honeydew dancing around the soft aromas of Rose.
 Region: Santa Cruz de LeonProducers: Ronny Hernandez Padilla and Ana Vita Padilla SolisFarm: Finca El RafelilloVarietal: Caturra // Catuai Altitude: 1750-1800 MASL Processing Method: Fully washed
 THIS COFFEE WAS SOURCED WITH CAFE IMPORTS
 This microlot comes to us courtesy of producers Ronny Hernández Padilla and Ana Vita Padilla Solís. They own and manage Finca El Rafelillo, a 5.5 hectare farm in the Leòn Cortez district of Tarrruzú, Costa Rica. This is a washed lot from the December-February harvest of 2015/2016.
 Café Imports bought its first Costa Rica microlot container at the end of the 2006/2007 harvest; at that time, microlot offerings were basically nonexistent. In six years, the Costa Rican microlot market has grown, and now Costa Rica is one of the most popular origins, delivering very consistent quality year after year.
 The Costas Café Imports is carrying are all sourced directly from micromills, and producers were paid at the farm-gate level. We managed local transportation, dry-milling, consolidation, and exportation of the coffees. This experience is extremely valuable, as it gives us a better understanding of what it takes to get coffee from cherry to export quality in GrainPro and jute with its corresponding marks.
 Rio Jorco’s owners are third-generation in the business. They are extremely focused on quality and conservation of nature. Los Lobos won Cup of Excellence #3 in 2012, and the owners have dedicated 3/4ths of the land to a private reserve. Rio Jorco is equipped with a complete wet- and dry-mill operation, which allows quality control throughout the process. They process coffee from their own farm, Los Lobos, but also purchase cherry from producers from the area. Producers are compensated based on cup quality, and get recognition for selling a microlot.
 Rio Jorco’s operations area is in the municipalities of Aserri, Acosta, Leon Cortez, Frailes, Desamparados, and Corralillo. These microregions of Tarrazu have won multiple Cup of Excellence awards, year after year.
 Café Imports is excited to bring you, once again, high-quality and traceable microlots from Costa Rica.

 Swiss Water Process involves first soaking the coffee in pure water. The green coffee extract that results is then passed through a carbon filter, specifically engineered to filter out the caffeine molecule. The green coffee extract is then introduced to the coffee but without the caffeine. This process is simple in theory, but impressive to execute, since the coffee has to be dried and preserved in an exacting way to ensure the inherent flavour of the coffee remains relatively unscathed.
 Great as both a filter, and an espresso, the cup profile is sweet, and subtle with flavours of cocoa, and caramel.
 Here are the parameters that we've been using with our latest Swiss Water Process (parameters for an 18g VST Precision Filter Basket)

 Initially conceived as an alternative to the erratically composed and often disappointing iced latte, our New Orleans iced coffee is cold-brewed for 12 hours with roasted chicory and sweetened with organic cane sugar. The end result is a potent concentrate that we cut with organic whole milk. It's sweet, creamy and, perhaps most importantly, consistently delicious.

 Just before you start the brewing process, grind one pound of coffee on a coarse setting.
 Add the grounds and 43 g of roasted chicory to your stockpot.
 Pour 2.5 quarts of filtered, cold water into the stockpot. Give the contents a few gentle stirs with a wooden spoon, so that all the grounds are visibly immersed.
 Cover the stockpot. Let its contents steep for 12 hours at room temperature.
 After the coffee's steeped, pour it through a fine-grained mesh sieve. Straining is easier if you first break the coffee crust with a wooden spoon. In terms of yield, look for about 4-5 cups of concentrate. As unappetizing as it may sound, the concentrate should resemble used motor oil.
 Add 85 g of simple syrup to your concentrate and incorporate it thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Serve over ice, and add milk to taste. The concentrate/milk ratio should be roughly equal. Unsweetened concentrate will last for 5-7 days. Once sweetened, it will only last for 1-2 days. Once you add milk, hustle up – it’s only excellent for an hour or so.

 Mr. Nicolas Castillo is so passionate about coffee that even at 63 years of age, he works out in the coffee plantation. Currently he has 60 hectares planted with coffee, to which he has dedicated much care and has constantly renovated to have the plantation in optimal conditions and younger plants to produce quality and higher yields. For Nicola’s plantation the best shade tree has been the Chalum and Capulil, which has planted around the coffee for the share of course but also for the organic material that they provide back to his soils. He is trying to grow his coffee as organic as possible.

  Acaia pearl - Digital Scale 1,550,-
  Finca Tamana by Tim Wendelboe 349,-
 Why you'll love it: One of our more darkly roasted single-origin coffees, this natural-processed Brazilian has the sweetness and nuttiness of a chocolate-caramel candy bar.
 Story of the bean: In the 1940s, coffee consumption was beginning to soar and Brazilian coffee producers struggled to find a coffee tree that could withstand the strong winds and rain in the tropical savannas south of the Amazon. The solution was a hybrid plant called Catuai, a highly productive dwarf variety prized for its sweetness. With rich chocolate flavor and a full body, the Blue Diamond is a shining example of a Brazilian Catuai.

 Ever since we've been exposed to "Sugar Processed" Decafs, we've fallen in love. Ethanol is used to extract a solvent found in sugarcane, which extracts the caffeine. Definitely the gentlest non-chemical decaffeination, and to boot this is done in the same country as the coffee was produced, Colombia, also a rarity in decaffeination. Honestly, this just tastes like a really beautiful coffee from Colombia, it just happens to be Decaf.

 We bought our first roaster in 1995, set it up in the front window of our DeMun Coffeehouse, and started roasting the best coffees we'd ever tasted. Over the years, we've learned quite a bit more about this delicate process and we're happy to say we're still roasting the best coffees we've ever tasted. 
 The process starts by selecting high-quality green (unroasted) coffees from the world's best farms and co-ops. We then develop a unique roast profile for each coffee based on its taste characteristics, density, and processing type.
 Most of the coffees we roast are single origin coffees, meaning they come from one unique farm, mill, or co-op. Our goal when roasting these fine coffees is to accentuate the natural taste components inherent to each coffee. Dark-roasting a single origin coffee typically melts away the character and unique qualities for which we bought the coffee in the first place.
 We also blend coffees together to create our signature blends, like Espresso 700 and Café Kaldi. These coffees are designed to fit a specific taste profile. The blend of coffees used to achieve that taste profile will change slightly throughout the year since coffees are seasonal.
 Whether blend or single origin, each coffee is now roasted by one of our experienced coffee roasters using either our 1937 Vintage 75-kilo Probat or our 1960's era 22-kilo Probat. Both roasters are top-of-the-line and feature cast iron pieces for added heat retention and fantastic air flow abilities.
 Green (unroasted) coffee is "charged" into the roaster's spinning drum. The drum spins the coffee constantly to avoid it being burned by the bank(s) of natural-gas powered flames that heat it. The roaster is able to add or subtract heat to change the speed at which the coffee is roasted. During every roast, we monitor the temperature of the beans in the drum, the temperature of the exhaust, and gas pressure. By noting the changes in these marks over time, we can make many small adjustments to the gas pressure and air-flow to change a roast profile. Some coffees taste better with a short, fast roast, while others may come out better with a low-and-slow profile. 
 Our attention to these small details with each coffee we produce is what makes Kaldi's Coffee unique and delicious. We know you'll taste it in the cup.
 Kaldiʼs Relationship Coffees offer consumers the opportunity to take a proactive and global approach to their coffee purchasing decisions. Building on the success and wisdom of Fair Trade Certified, Kaldiʼs Relationship Coffees provide even greater transparency into the otherwise complex coffee transaction chain - from coffee grower to coffee lover.
 Our philosophy is simple: premium-priced coffees should taste premium. With Kaldiʼs Relationship Coffees, we select with our palates, ensure that our farmer friends are rewarded for their efforts, and that the coffee is grown in a sustainable, ecologically sound manner.
 The goals of Kaldiʼs Relationship Coffees are simple:
 Kosher foods are selected and prepared in accordance with traditional Jewish ritual and dietary laws. All of Kaldi’s Coffees are processed under supervision of the Vaad Hoeir of St. Louis, one of the world’s most respected kashrus agencies. While there is nothing inherently “un-kosher” about coffee in general, we invite a specially trained rabbi’s inspection of our roasting facility to ensure that our practices conform to the highest standards of cleanliness and purity. That inspection permits Kaldi’s to use the prestigious “OV” symbol  on our packaging – your guarantee that Kaldi’s Coffee meets that highest standards of cleanliness and kosher conformity. Even if you don’t observe kosher dietary prescriptions, these ancient traditions are considered by many to be among the most important food safety conventions in practice. For more information about kosher food, visit www.ovkosher.org.
 In 2001, we were one of the first retailers in St. Louis to offer certified Fair Trade Coffees. These coffees are monitored by Fair Trade Federation ensuring that at least a minimum sustainable wage was paid to the co-op at origin that exported the coffee. The Fair Trade minimum changes occasionally to reflect the economies and conditions at origin. We are happy to say that we have always and will always be paying at least this much for all of our coffees, and continue to improve upon the movement Fair Trade has started.
 Over the last few years, we have started focusing on new programs (see Kaldi’s Relationship Coffees) that reward quality and taste as well as help small farmers who may not qualify for Fair Trade certification. These coffees are typically produced by small, independent farmers and co-ops who have started to build value based on the quality of their coffee rather than a certification.
 Kaldi’s is a Certified Organic handler and processor of organic coffees and goods, meaning we buy and sell organic coffees and teas that have been grown without the use of harmful chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. In addition, and what most never realize, is that we follow a tedious and carefully-monitored set of specific operations when handling and packaging organic coffees and teas. Only then, when we follow these operations and pass our audits, can our coffee be offered as Certified Organic. Feel free to learn more via the USDA or through our certifying agent, Quality Assurance International.

 We at Variety cherish being able to provide single-farmer lots. It helps showcase the diverse offerings we have access to through Red Fox Coffee Merchants, as well as highlight the variations that each individual farmer can produce with each coffee. Fernando Belalcazar produces a delicious coffee from Nariño whose complexities change as the coffee cools. The high elevation helps develop an interplay between sweet and savory notes that bring out the best in each other.

 This coffee was a magic carpet ride for us. Starting with the depth of Figs, zigging to the sweetness of a Mango, and zagging to the end with a splash of White Grape Juice. It's a whole new world. 
 Region: Rio NegroFarm: 5 VariousMunicipality: IquiraVarietal: Yellow BourbonAltitude: 1600-1750 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed 
 Yellow Bourbon is a natural cross between Red Bourbon and Amarelo de Botacuto, which is labelled as a Typica variant with yellow fruit. Bourbon resulted from selections made by French botanists in wild Yemeni coffee groves. Moved to controlled fields for propagation, the relatively humble stock produced a remarkable variety and was given the namesake of its nursery - Bourbon Island - upon its introduction to South American. Under expanded cultivation in Brazil, a yellow mutant with a unique flavor profile expressed itself and was isolated, expanded, and named for its color.
 This Variety Select lot comes to us courtesy of five small farmers from the villages surrounding the municipality of Iquira. With volcanic soil, anaverage temperature of 20-25° C, and 160 CM of annual rainfall, this area is extremely conducive to the cultivation of coffee. Generally, these farmers are processing only ripe cherries the same day of harvest using a dry fermentation of 18-24 hours. The coffees are then washed, and dried in parabolicos for an average duration of 12-18 days.

 THIS COFFEE WAS SOURCED WITH CAFE IMPORTS
 This microlot comes to us courtesy of producers Ronny Hernández Padilla and Ana Vita Padilla Solís. They own and manage Finca El Rafelillo, a 5.5 hectare farm in the Leòn Cortez district of Tarrruzú, Costa Rica. This is a washed lot from the December-February harvest of 2015/2016.
 Café Imports bought its first Costa Rica microlot container at the end of the 2006/2007 harvest; at that time, microlot offerings were basically nonexistent. In six years, the Costa Rican microlot market has grown, and now Costa Rica is one of the most popular origins, delivering very consistent quality year after year.
 The Costas Café Imports is carrying are all sourced directly from micromills, and producers were paid at the farm-gate level. We managed local transportation, dry-milling, consolidation, and exportation of the coffees. This experience is extremely valuable, as it gives us a better understanding of what it takes to get coffee from cherry to export quality in GrainPro and jute with its corresponding marks.
 Rio Jorco’s owners are third-generation in the business. They are extremely focused on quality and conservation of nature. Los Lobos won Cup of Excellence #3 in 2012, and the owners have dedicated 3/4ths of the land to a private reserve. Rio Jorco is equipped with a complete wet- and dry-mill operation, which allows quality control throughout the process. They process coffee from their own farm, Los Lobos, but also purchase cherry from producers from the area. Producers are compensated based on cup quality, and get recognition for selling a microlot.
 Rio Jorco’s operations area is in the municipalities of Aserri, Acosta, Leon Cortez, Frailes, Desamparados, and Corralillo. These microregions of Tarrazu have won multiple Cup of Excellence awards, year after year.
 Café Imports is excited to bring you, once again, high-quality and traceable microlots from Costa Rica.

 THIS COFFEE WAS SOURCED BY CAFE IMPORTS
 This process is known as E.A. Sugarcane. It starts by fermenting molasses to create ethanol and combining it with acetic acid–found in vinegar–to make ethyl acetate. This is added to water, and applied to the green coffee to dissolve the caffeine completely out of the beans. The caffeine is separated from the greens and is steamed and washed with more water.
 This is truly an exceptional cup of coffee with flavors of citrus, caramel, and honey.

 Lots of love from Ethiopia. Muscovado Sugar and Jasmine start the journey and they fall into a bed of Apricots. We can't stop. 
 Region: Shakiso, OromiaFarm: Kayon Mountain Varietal: TypicaAltitude: 1900–2200 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed & Sun Dried
 The Kayon Mountain Coffee Farm is owned by multiple families that have been born and raised around the experience of coffee. These share-holding members had mainly been supplying coffee to auction for the past 30 years until they started their farm in 2012. This farm boasts a 500 hecatarespread, of which half is planted in heriloom Typica coffee and the other land reserved for cabbage, and indigenous shade trees. By 2015, they had implimented washing stations and dry-hullers allowing them to start exporting their own coffees and now see an annual production of about 300 tonnes. The coffees see an average fermentation time of 24-26 hours, followed by an average drying time of 12-20 days. As for the future, Kayon Mountain plans to plant more coffee, improve the quality of their processing, and even begin leasing more land to expand their practice.
 The ECX was started in 2008 to help protect farmers from market forces that might prevent them from making a living. Most of the coffee in Ethiopia is produced by small-holders who own 0.7 hectares, bumper crops often lead to big price drops, which can make it unprofitable for farmers to harvest their coffee. What the ECX does is commoditize grains- including sesame, beans, maize, wheat, and most importantly, coffee. This ensures prompt payment to farmers. It also integrates all parts of the “eco-system” involved in a grains market, including warehousing, grading, trading, and payment. Access to information is emphasized, as farmers can obtain information about trading prices and local delivery points easily through dedicated telephone lines.
 Here is a general rundown of how the ECX chain works in Ethiopia:
 While this system does ensure prompt payment and streamlines supply chain issues, it removes essentially all traceability from the coffee. This is problematic in the specialty world, where traceability is paramount.
 The ECX does not allow for complete traceability, but coffee cooperatives in Ethiopia do have the ability to go around the ECX and export the coffee themselves. Coffees that are exported by a cooperative can have traceability, possibly even to a single farmer.

 At Intelligentsia Coffee and Tea we always strive to send you the finest and freshest coffee possible. We are roasting and shipping orders from our Los Angeles Roasting Works for everyone West of the Rockies and our Chicago Roasting Works for everyone East of the Rockies. If you place an order before 3pm Sunday - Thursday (Central Time), your coffee will be roasted, packed, and shipped the next production day from either our Los Angeles or Chicago Roasting Works. The facility of origin is dependent upon the closest zip code of the shipping address. All orders placed after 3pm Thursday through Sunday at 3pm will be roasted, packed, and shipped on Monday. Due to this demanding schedule, we are not able to add additional items onto an order that is already in production. If you have already submitted an order and would like additional items, a separate order will need to be placed. An addition to a current order may cause a 24 hour delay in production and shipping.
 At this time, our Los Angeles location does not offer some of the items that our Chicago location does due to space constraints. If your order consists of items whose availability is split between Chicago and LA, we will automatically split your order for you. During checkout, you are given the option to delete the items which are shipping from the non-preferred location. Some orders placed on Thursday for Friday shipping may be delayed until Monday due to availability. Please note that once an order is placed we are not able to hold that order for a date other than what is specified on the above Production Schedule.
 Micro-Lots and Reserve Offerings Our Reserve coffees (Cup of Excellence, Micro-Lots, Best of and other competition coffees) are roasted everyday in Chicago and only roasted on Tuesdays in Los Angeles, or as otherwise noted on individual coffee pages. Any Los Angeles Roasting Works based order containing Reserve offerings will be delayed until the next available Tuesday. If you would like to purchase other coffees but do not wish to have your entire order delayed, please place separate orders. International Customers Please note that deliveries placed for addresses outside the United States will be shipped USPS and may incur additional charges from Customs.

 La Gaitana is a micro blend of coffees from various producers near small towns such as Timana, Palestina and Pitalito in South Huila. The majority of specialty coffee exported from Colombia comes from this region, and also hosts various Cup of Excellence winners. The average farm size here is 3-4 hectares, producing coffee almost year round. The most common varietals in this region are Castillo, Caturra and Typica. We named this micro blend after the chief who led the resistance against the Spanish invaders in South Huilla during the 16th century.

 Southpaw espresso is a bright and juicy blend that earns its name from being nimble, surprising, and packed with a punch. This shot is well balanced, achieving a complex and sweet flavor profile with enough body to punch through short milk drinks. Southpaw is designed to work well as a straight shot or in drinks 6 ounces and under, such as a cortado or macchiato.
 If your machine is programmable, we recommend pulling this espresso with the group head set at 199 Fahrenheit.
 Dose: 20 gramsYield: 32 – 34 gramsTime: 26 – 28 secondsDrop: 6 – 8 seconds (bottomless filter)Rest: 8 – 12 days off roast
 This espresso is best dialed in as a straight, slightly ristretto shot.
 For more info on our espressos, check out the Dialing in Our Espresso Guide.
 Jabs of fruit, sugar, and spice with a floral aroma and clean finish. Featuring notes of caramel, peach and sugar cane, Southpaw delivers a delightful punch.[[Description Card]] [[Coffee Info Sheet]]

 This coffee was a magic carpet ride for us. Starting with the depth of Figs, zigging to the sweetness of a Mango, and zagging to the end with a splash of White Grape Juice. It's a whole new world. 
 Region: Rio NegroFarm: 5 VariousMunicipality: IquiraVarietal: Yellow BourbonAltitude: 1600-1750 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed 
 Yellow Bourbon is a natural cross between Red Bourbon and Amarelo de Botacuto, which is labelled as a Typica variant with yellow fruit. Bourbon resulted from selections made by French botanists in wild Yemeni coffee groves. Moved to controlled fields for propagation, the relatively humble stock produced a remarkable variety and was given the namesake of its nursery - Bourbon Island - upon its introduction to South American. Under expanded cultivation in Brazil, a yellow mutant with a unique flavor profile expressed itself and was isolated, expanded, and named for its color.
 This Variety Select lot comes to us courtesy of five small farmers from the villages surrounding the municipality of Iquira. With volcanic soil, anaverage temperature of 20-25° C, and 160 CM of annual rainfall, this area is extremely conducive to the cultivation of coffee. Generally, these farmers are processing only ripe cherries the same day of harvest using a dry fermentation of 18-24 hours. The coffees are then washed, and dried in parabolicos for an average duration of 12-18 days.

 Lots of love from Ethiopia. Muscovado Sugar and Jasmine start the journey and they fall into a bed of Apricots. We can't stop. 
 Region: Shakiso, OromiaFarm: Kayon Mountain Varietal: TypicaAltitude: 1900–2200 MASLProcessing Method: Fully Washed & Sun Dried
 The Kayon Mountain Coffee Farm is owned by multiple families that have been born and raised around the experience of coffee. These share-holding members had mainly been supplying coffee to auction for the past 30 years until they started their farm in 2012. This farm boasts a 500 hecatarespread, of which half is planted in heriloom Typica coffee and the other land reserved for cabbage, and indigenous shade trees. By 2015, they had implimented washing stations and dry-hullers allowing them to start exporting their own coffees and now see an annual production of about 300 tonnes. The coffees see an average fermentation time of 24-26 hours, followed by an average drying time of 12-20 days. As for the future, Kayon Mountain plans to plant more coffee, improve the quality of their processing, and even begin leasing more land to expand their practice.
 The ECX was started in 2008 to help protect farmers from market forces that might prevent them from making a living. Most of the coffee in Ethiopia is produced by small-holders who own 0.7 hectares, bumper crops often lead to big price drops, which can make it unprofitable for farmers to harvest their coffee. What the ECX does is commoditize grains- including sesame, beans, maize, wheat, and most importantly, coffee. This ensures prompt payment to farmers. It also integrates all parts of the “eco-system” involved in a grains market, including warehousing, grading, trading, and payment. Access to information is emphasized, as farmers can obtain information about trading prices and local delivery points easily through dedicated telephone lines.
 Here is a general rundown of how the ECX chain works in Ethiopia:
 While this system does ensure prompt payment and streamlines supply chain issues, it removes essentially all traceability from the coffee. This is problematic in the specialty world, where traceability is paramount.
 The ECX does not allow for complete traceability, but coffee cooperatives in Ethiopia do have the ability to go around the ECX and export the coffee themselves. Coffees that are exported by a cooperative can have traceability, possibly even to a single farmer.

 In Burundi’s northern Kayanza province, Heza Washing Station constantly pushes the envelope to exceed their own impossibly high standards. The station is built on an escarpment that faces an expansive natural forest reserve. At such high elevation, the sun is strong and the air is thin. But the cool arboreal air brings relief and circulates around the drying beds stacked into the hillside like bleachers in a coliseum. Heza’s team takes overnight shifts to monitor fermentation and sorts each harvest into microlots. Eventually, the impeccably washed Bourbon makes its way to designated hills prior to sale, and Nkonge is the hill from which this inspiring coffee gets its name. If there were a perfect coffee made for perfectionists, this might be it. Juicy, satisfying, and with complex sugars, Nkonge reminds you that effort indeed leads to reward. And the path need not be arduous if lined with banana leaves drying underfoot, softening each step along the way.

    We are excited to welcome the return of Yukro. Named after the village of Yukro, this coffee is produced in a cooperative made up of around 400 members who operate both as shareholders and farmers who deliver coffee from small plots. Yukro is located in the Gera District of Jimma in Western Ethiopia. This part of Ethiopia has historically been known for producing low-quality coffees. However, over the last few years a handful of smaller mills have sprouted up and begun to harvest and process with more precision. This has quickly put them on the map with some of the most delicious coffees in the world. Yukro, in its 7th year of operation, began as a partnership with an NGO named Technoserve. Technoserve partners with small cooperatives and farms to give them the tools needed to improve quality, market their coffees, and ultimately earn more well deserved money for their product.

    With Ethiopia being the birthplace of coffee, there are a lot of factors that set its coffee apart. The coffee in this area grows wild and some coffee trees mature for hundreds of years without any additional fertilization.
    Unlike many other parts of the world where farmers are able to identify specific varieties of their coffee, Yukro is a unique blend of wild, heirloom varieties. These heirloom coffee plants are often unknown and comprised of multiple varieties into one plant. It is their complex make-up that leads these coffees to take on complexity in flavor and powerful aromatics. At Yukro, the coffee cherries are picked, demucilaged (a process that removes the skin and nearly all of the mucilage), and soaked overnight in water. Then they are washed the next morning to assure all of the mucilage is completely removed before the coffee is dried and sorted on raised beds. All of these meticulous processes contribute to an extraordinarily clean and well-defined cup of coffee that is sure to stand out.

    We’ve been buying this coffee since 2013. A 2014 Good Food Award Winner, Yukro offers an elegant balance of floral and fruit flavors, a juicy body, and a clean, clear finish.

 These blends reflect the freshest coffees of the season. 123°W Longitude Blend is a medium roast and French is for those who enjoy dark roasts.
 
REGION: Lintong
VARIETAL: Ateng, Jember and Garundang
FARM: Lintongnihuta (shors of Lake Toba)
ALTITUDE: 1000-1300 M
FARMER: Various
ROAST: Medium
NOTES: Wet-Hulled Process

 
This larger bean from Lake Toba brings out complex flavors of raisin, plum, cocoa, with hints of sweet herbs and fresh green peppers along with a full body, lively acidity and a sweet finish.
    
    The Sumatra Lintong Mutu Batak comes from selected producers surrounding the town of Lintongnihuta in the Provinsi Sumatera Utara (Northern Sumatra Province).  This specific area is located on the southern shores of Lake Toba, which is the largest volcanic lake in the world.  The soil around the southern part of the lake is volcanic which leads to exceptional terrain for growing coffee.  The town of Lintong Nihuta sites on a plateau that ranges from 1000 meters with a few farms around 1300 meters.  
    
    The producers of this coffee are small farmers who have been recognized by our staff to produce exceptional raw material.  These selected farmers run small two to four hectare plantations with each hectare consists of approximately 1,000 coffee trees. The farmer grows, harvests, and depulps the coffee on the farm.  After depulping he stores the coffee overnight, allowing it to ferment and washes the following day.  After washing the farmer will briefly dry the coffee to remove the moisture from the exterior of the parchment and delivers the coffee to our production facility.
    
    At this point the coffee is inspected to ensure that it surpasses our expectations.  If the coffees do not pass inspection, we will not purchase the shipment.  If the coffees meet our requirements, we will put into greenhouses for drying down to about 40% moisture.  At this point, the coffee will be hulled and then put back into the greenhouse for further drying.  
    
    After the coffee is dried to 12 to 13% moisture content in the greenhouses, the coffee will be delivered to the warehouse in Medan.  It is inspected and graded again upon arrival to ensure no errors were made during processing.  The coffee is then warehoused for 2 months.  Then it goes through the final grading, hand sorted, bagged and ready for export.

 Producer: 50 Small-Holders  Farm: Pandumaan Village, Collector: Kardon Nainggolan  Altitude: 4500 feet  Region: Lintong, Sumatra  Varietal: Sigararutang (Catimor)  Process: Wet-Hulled  Roast: Medium  Notes: Root Beer, Prune, Butterscotch  
 This coffee is brought to us by our friends at Crop to Cup. The coffee comes from the Pandumaan village in Lintong, a region just south of Sumatra’s Lake Toba, which is known for producing specialty coffee. Grown by as many as 50 small-holder farmers, this coffee is collected in Pandumann by Kardon Nainggolan. Aside from the quality, this coffee lot is special because it is grown exclusively by women farmers, most of them widows. To celebrate this fact, they have named the lot Batak Nuali. Nuali means “pretty,” and Batak refers to the tribe who lives in this area of Lintong. This is the first year this specific lot has been produced and it impressed us on the cupping table. We hope you will enjoy it.
 This lightly roasted coffee features the signature Sumatran aroma of sweet pipe tobacco and cocoa, has a juicy acidity and a velvety body. When brewed it has a flavor of root beer and raisin, with a deep prune-like sweetness. There is a soft note of baking spices and butterscotch in the finish.

 Put your aeropress and cup on a scale. Bring filtered water to a boil. Thoroughly rinse paper filter to get rid of paper flavor.
 Weigh out 18 grams of whole bean coffee. Grind the coffee a bit finer than filter drip (or use a grind that suits best for flavor and extraction).
 Pull water off of the boil, and wait 45 seconds to a minute, or until the water is 200-205 degrees Fahrenheit. Start your timer, and quickly pour the water into the aeropress until it reaches 270 grams of water (near the top). Stir coffee.
 Place plunger in just enough to seal the top, and keep coffee from dripping through.
  At 50 seconds, remove the plunger, and stir for five seconds. Place the plunger back on the aeropress to keep coffee from dripping through.
 At 1 minute 45 seconds, remove plunger and stir for 5 seconds. Place the plunger and slowly push down for 20 seconds, until you hear a hissing sound. There should be moderate resistance. If it's very difficult to push down, your grind is too fine, if it's very easy, your grind is too coarse.

 Banner Dark is a crowd pleaser, as delicious brewed using a French Press as it is using a traditional drip/filter method. While the components change, this blend perpetually showcases a heavy body and a sweet, lasting finish with low acidity in the cup.

 In our view, coffees from the Sidama zone rarely stand-up to the powerhouses of the area around yirgacheffe. This coffee is definitely an exception to that rule. We’re particularly excited to offer this as espresso, given its creamy, smooth body. This lot hails from a private washing station in the little-known Arbe Gona district of Sidama. The station is owned by Astateke Abebe and about 730 growers submit coffee there for processing. The altitude for the area is typical of Sidama at 1600 to 1750 meters.
 During his trip to Ethiopia this year, Phil cupped through about 50 lots from Sidama. Although there is more top quality coffee coming from that area then ever before, most if it lacks the sweetness and perfumed qualities of other Ethiopia regions. This lot from Aroresa stood-up strong on both of these fronts, and it still tastes amazing on arrival.
 One of the reasons that this coffee still tastes so good after the long voyage to Calgary is the proper drying of the lot. A major issue that Ethiopia faces is over-drying. The days get very hot and the humidity is not at high as other countries (such as Kenya). Drying is a delicate process. On one hand, if the coffee is under-dried then it’s exposed to microbial growth. On the other hand, the drying process removes volatile flavor compounds along with the water, so over-drying can remove complexity. Additionally, over-drying coffee can kill the embryo of the bean (which is actually a seed), which will cause serious and irreversible flavor degradation.
 This lot was purchased from a private mill, which means that it was sold through the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (EXC). The exchange began by trading sesame, and now it trades navy beans, maize, wheat, and of course, coffee! The system was set up to apply grades to each commodity and set prices based on these grades. This has proven problematic for coffee, as assigning it a “grade 1” is not nearly descriptive enough to articulate the unique qualities of a given coffee! Solutions are in-progress to improve upon the way that the ECX handles coffee though, and overall, the exchange has brought a lot of good to the Ethiopian economic sector. The increased transparency has also been good for the washing station owners.
 There has been a steep learning curve for these small business owners (who own the washing stations) to set the proper price for coffee cherry that will ensure they have healthy profits. Last year, many washing station owners were in dire straits because they paid too much for coffee cherry and they couldn’t recoup their costs. This year, it seems that the bidding wars have settled out and washing station owners are setting rational prices based on what they can sell the coffee for. That said, we want to see these prices continue to climb, as coffee in Ethiopia is still undervalued!
